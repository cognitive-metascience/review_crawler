This involves coordinating a complex series of interactions between transcription factors and their target binding sites on DNA, leading to the recruitment or exclusion of active RNA polymerases, which determines the transcriptional state of the gene. Live imaging experiments have shown that transcription factor binding in eukaryotic cell lines and embryos is dynamic but transient, occurring frequently but with each event lasting for at most a few seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Izeddin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Normanno et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, recent studies have shown that many developmental enhancers harbor functionally important low-affinity binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antosova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crocker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaudet and Mango, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lebrecht et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorberbaum et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rister et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rowan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanay, 2006</xref>). One example is the Homeobox (Hox) family that is responsible for body segment identity along the anterior-posterior axis in animals. Because Hox transcription factors descended from a common ancestor, their preferences for binding sequences are very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGinnis and Krumlauf, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noyes et al., 2008</xref>). To select for specific Hox factors, several enhancers in the <italic>shavenbaby</italic> (<italic>svb</italic>) locus make use of low-affinity binding sequences for Ultrabithorax (Ubx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker et al., 2015</xref>). Svb is a transcription factor that drives the formation of trichomes, epidermal projections on the surface of the segmented fly embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chanut-Delalande et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Payre et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, a key question was how low affinity binding sequences are able to drive strong transcriptional activation in developing embryos.</p><p>We have previously shown in living <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryos that Ubx transiently but repeatedly explores the same physical locations in a nucleus, which are likely clusters of binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>). We have additionally shown that transcriptional microenvironments of high local Ubx and cofactor concentrations surround active transcription sites driven by low-affinity <italic>svb</italic> enhancers. As the distributions of many transcription factors in the nucleus are highly heterogeneous, the transcriptional activity of low-affinity enhancers would depend on the local microenvironments. Interestingly, we observed that transcriptionally active, minimalized versions of two of the three ventral <italic>svb</italic> enhancers (<italic>E3</italic> and <italic>7</italic>) are Ubx-responsive and preferentially appear near or overlap spatially with transcription sites of the endogenous <italic>svb</italic> gene, despite being on different chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>). This colocalization suggests microenvironments could be shared between related enhancers to increase transcriptional output, where enhancers would synergistically form a larger local trap for transcription factors than each could alone. Retaining multiple enhancers within a microenvironment could also provide redundancy in case individual enhancers are compromised and buffer negative impacts when the system is subjected to stress. This idea is consistent with the observed phenotypic robustness of <italic>svb</italic> enhancers in maintaining sufficient trichome numbers even under temperature stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>). These results are consistent with multi-component transcriptional ‘hubs’ that are local areas enriched for components of the transcriptional machinery and transcription factors through multiple attractive and cooperative interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cisse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furlong and Levine, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghavi-Helm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mir et al., 2018</xref>). One potential building block for these ‘hubs’ are multiple, long-range, enhancer-to-enhancer interactions. However, it is not yet understood how such multivalent interactions function mechanistically, and how they contribute to phenotypic robustness.</p><p>To understand the mechanistic implications of having multiple enhancers in a shared microenvironment, here we examined the ability of the <italic>svb</italic> locus to maintain transcriptional output and produce the correct phenotype under temperature-induced stress in flies harboring a deletion of a partially redundant enhancer—the <italic>DG3</italic> ventral enhancer. When embryos were raised at high temperatures, we observed phenotypical defects in ventral trichome formation for the <italic>DG3</italic>-deletion <italic>svb</italic> allele but not for the wild-type. At the molecular level, Ubx concentrations around transcription sites of the <italic>DG3</italic>-deletion allele decreased. The transcriptional output of <italic>svb</italic> without <italic>DG3</italic> also decreased. To test the hypothesis that shared microenvironments modulate transcriptional output and provide buffering under stress, we sought to rescue the <italic>DG3</italic>-deletion allele through inserting the complete <italic>svb cis</italic>-regulatory region on a BAC (<italic>svbBAC</italic>) on a different chromosome. We observed that Ubx concentration around active transcription sites of the <italic>DG3</italic>-deletion allele and their transcriptional output increased when the <italic>svbBAC</italic> is physically nearby. Moreover, we found that trichome formation was partially rescued at high temperature. As a result, our findings support the hypothesis that shared microenvironments provide a mechanism for phenotypic robustness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>DG3</italic> enhancer responds specifically to Ubx in the A1 segment</title><p>The ventral <italic>svb</italic> enhancers <italic>DG3</italic>, <italic>E3</italic> and <italic>7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) contain low-affinity Ubx binding sites and have been shown to be transcribed in microenvironments of high Ubx concentrations in the first abdominal (A1) segment on the ventral surface of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>). Each of these enhancers produces ventral stripes of expression along segments A1-A7 in the embryo, resembling the endogenous expression pattern of <italic>svb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Each enhancer contributes to different but partially overlapping portions of the total expression pattern. Furthermore, they have different Ubx ChIP enrichment profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whereas the interaction of <italic>E3</italic> and <italic>7</italic> with Ubx had been previously explored in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>DG3</italic> remained unexplored. Therefore, we tested the response of the <italic>DG3</italic> enhancer to Ubx by altering Ubx levels and measuring the transcriptional output with a reporter gene (<italic>lacZ</italic>). In wild-type embryos, the <italic>DG3</italic> reporter gene was expressed ventrally in stripes along segments A1-A7, in addition to narrow thoracic stripes in T1-T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Expression from <italic>DG3</italic> on the ventral surface in the T2 and T3 segments was weak with wild-type Ubx expression and was primarily seen on the sides. In the absence of Ubx, <italic>DG3</italic> reporter expression was almost completely lost on the ventral side of A1 and reduced between A2-A7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with the responses of <italic>E3</italic>, <italic>7</italic> and the full <italic>svb</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker et al., 2015</xref>). The incomplete loss of expression in A2-A7 suggests that additional factors influence the expression of ventral trichomes in those segments. Ubiquitous expression of Ubx increased the expression levels in A1-A7, in addition to generating ectopic expressions on the ventral side of the thoracic segments T2-T3 and A8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In summary, we showed that Ubx is necessary for <italic>DG3</italic> expression in the ventral region of the abdominal segments (completely in A1 and partially in A2-7) and can induce ectopic expressions when overexpressed. These data are consistent with our previous observation of the localization of <italic>DG3</italic>-driven transcription sites within Ubx microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45325.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ubx drives the expression of the <italic>DG3 shavenbaby</italic> enhancer along the ventral abdominal segments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of the <italic>shavenbaby</italic> (<italic>svb</italic>) gene contains three enhancers expressing stripes on the ventral side of the abdominal segments: <italic>DG3</italic>, <italic>E3</italic> and <italic>7</italic>.

These results are similar to those shown with quartenary A5 trichomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>).

We reasoned that the defect could be due to changes in the transcription factor concentration around the enhancers (input) and/or the transcriptional output of the gene (output). As Ubx is specifically needed to drive <italic>DG3</italic> and <italic>svb</italic> expression on the ventral surface of the A1 segment, we used it as a metric for the transcription factor distributions around <italic>svb</italic> transcription sites.

For all imaging experiments involving the <italic>svb</italic> allele with the deletion, we selected only homozygous embryos for imaging (See ‘Imaging fixed embryos’ in Materials and Methods). Because <italic>DG3</italic> expression in the A1 segment showed a clear link to changes in Ubx level, we focused most of our subsequent imaging quantifications in this segment.</p><p>To gauge the Ubx concentration around a transcription site, we counted the averaged intensity in the Ubx IF channel within a circle four pixels in diameter (170 nm, roughly the resolution limit of AiryScan) centered on the transcription site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, see ‘Analysis of microenvironment and <italic>svb</italic> transcription intensity’ in materials and methods). In nuclei from the A1 segment, Ubx intensities around <italic>svb</italic> transcription sites with the wild-type allele did not significantly change between 25°C and 32°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom right panel). Measuring Ubx intensity from random locations within nuclei of wild-type embryos expressing <italic>svb</italic> at 25°C using the same method showed that Ubx concentrations around <italic>svb</italic> transcription sites were in general higher than the nuclear average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>).

However, there was a clear decrease in Ubx intensity compared to the wild-type when we subjected the <italic>DG3</italic>-deletion embryos to heat-stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel, and 3C, bottom right panel).

Deletion of the <italic>DG3</italic> enhancer from <italic>svb</italic> did not lead to clear defects in ventral trichome formation unless the embryos were subjected to heat-induced stress, as shown here and previously with the deletion of ‘shadow enhancers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2008</xref>) for lateral <italic>svb</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, we observed that the <italic>DG3</italic>-deletion allele showed reduced transcriptional output even at normal temperature. Wild-type embryos did not show phenotypic defects under either normal or stressed conditions, but heat-induced stress led to slightly lower transcriptional output from the wild-type <italic>svb</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). However, the mutant <italic>svb</italic> locus, starting with lower transcriptional output even under ideal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), drops below a threshold and the system fails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

While this data must be interpreted with some caution, as multiple stages of the transcription cycle are included (initiation, elongation or termination), Ubx concentration increases after a certain point were not clearly coupled to increases in <italic>svb</italic> transcriptional output. Additional regulatory mechanisms could be at play beyond transcription factor retention that determines the final transcriptional output of the locus. Determining the complete response function would be complicated, due to reasons such as the enhancers each having clusters of factor binding sites and the overlap of expression patterns from related enhancers.

It is possible that structural elements, such as insulator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2018</xref>) or other topologically associated elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furlong and Levine, 2018</xref>) could overcome this by increasing pairing efficiency. This is consistent with recent findings for long-range interactions that are dependent on specific topologically associating domains (TADs), where pairing is necessary but not sufficient for transvection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Viets et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, embryos with the <italic>DG3</italic> deletion allele and <italic>svbBAC</italic> could not produce trichomes at the dorsal edges of the ventral trichome patches, where <italic>DG3</italic> provides exclusive coverage. As the rescue only occurred on regions where other ventral <italic>svb</italic> enhancers provided overlapping coverage, it likely is the result of compensation from the additional ventral enhancers (<italic>E3</italic> and <italic>7</italic>) at the <italic>svb</italic> locus instead of the <italic>DG3</italic> enhancer on the <italic>svbBAC</italic> driving <italic>svb</italic> expression <italic>in trans</italic>. Interactions <italic>in trans</italic> may serve an auxiliary role through influencing the properties of the local transcriptional environments.</p><p>Summarizing our observations, we hypothesize that the relationship between <italic>svb</italic> transcriptional output and the number of cells fated to become trichomes is sigmoidal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, bottom panel). Below a certain threshold, the number of trichomes would drop with decreasing <italic>svb</italic> mRNA; however, any additional transcriptional output above this threshold (the green box in the figure) would not lead to significant changes in trichome production and would appear to be wild-type in phenotype. The <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of wild-type <italic>svb</italic> under ideal conditions likely already saturates the system, as evidenced by the lack of change in Ubx concentration and trichome numbers even with the addition of <italic>svbBAC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Although operating under saturation renders this system relatively insensitive to changes in <italic>svb</italic> transcription, the risk of developing defective phenotypes when conditions are no longer ideal likely selected for this strategy to buffer against stresses. Overall, the system remains phenotypically robust and develops the same number of trichomes despite fluctuations in transcriptional outputs. In the future, it would be important to understand mechanistically how the phenotype can tolerate significant drops in transcriptional output before defects appear. It requires the direct observation of intermediate steps between <italic>svb</italic> transcription and phenotype production to understand how this buffering is achieved. Furthermore, our current technique only allows us to probe environments around active transcription sites without knowing which phase of transcription (initiation, elongation or termination) it is in and how the gene loci positioned themselves into these locations. Future works to visualize and track genes, regardless of their transcriptional state, in fixed and living embryos would answer key questions on how they find, form and interact with transcriptional microenvironments.</p><p>We previously proposed that transcriptional microenvironments form across multiple enhancers through scaffolding interactions to ensure efficient transcription from developmental enhancers. By investigating the mechanisms of how correct transcriptional regulation is maintained under stress using a <italic>DG3</italic>-deletion allele of <italic>svb</italic>, we have shown that transcriptional microenvironments could span multiple enhancers that share similar transcription factor binding sites. These microenvironments of transcription factors could form the protein core of transcription factor ‘hubs’ that have been proposed to form through phase-separation mediated through protein-protein interactions between disordered domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cisse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furlong and Levine, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghavi-Helm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mir et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, they add another layer of redundancy on top of using multiple enhancers with overlapping expression patterns in a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region to ensure a sufficient margin to buffer against the negative effects of environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perry et al., 2010</xref>). This extra margin of safety preserves phenotypical development even when environmental conditions are not ideal. Integrating multiple noisy and low-affinity elements into a coherent and synergistic network would also reduce the variance stemming from the transient and stochastic transcription factor binding dynamics observed in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cisse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghavi-Helm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>). In sum, specialized transcriptional microenvironments could be a critical element to ensure that gene expression occurs specifically and consistently in every embryo. Given that shadow enhancers are widespread features of gene regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cannavò et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>), it is likely that high local concentrations of transcription factors are a widespread feature that provides an effective regulatory buffer to prevent deleterious phenotypic consequences to genetic and environmental perturbations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>All fly strains used have been previously described: <italic>DG3-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>); <italic>ubx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker et al., 2015</xref>); <italic>HS::ubx-1</italic>: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker et al., 2015</xref>); <italic>Df(X)svb<sup>108</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>); <italic>svbBAC-dsRed</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preger-Ben Noon et al., 2018</xref>); <italic>diBAC-gfp</italic> is CH322-35A16 EGFP tagged in VK37, covering D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Venken et al., 2009</xref>).

decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Multi-enhancer transcriptional hubs confer phenotypic robustness&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Essential points to address are the following:</p><p>1) The connection between enhancers, Ubx protein concentration, transcriptional output, and phenotype. Although different concentrations of Ubx are measured at the deleted vs. wild-type locus, an important point that the three reviewers agree upon is that gene expression levels and Ubx concentrations are not well correlated. There appear to be other unexplained factors that are influencing the expression of <italic>svb</italic> that do not correlate with the TF concentration. Thus, it is unclear whether the experiments described here support or reject the hypothesis laid out in the &quot;multi-enhancer &quot;hubs&quot; improve robustness by increasing transcription factor retention near transcription sites.&quot;</p><p>The authors must consider further whether the global measurements shown in Figure 3 are the most effective measure of this proposed correlation, or whether a more fine-grained analysis might support the idea that boosted Ubx levels from complexed enhancers are driving transcription. As noted below, the authors might show scatter plots of Ubx concentration vs. <italic>svb</italic> transcription within each condition. A positive correlation would support their hypothesis.</p><p>The trichome phenotype is also not directly correlated to the transcriptional outputs and Ubx concentrations, and as mentioned in the Discussion, further layers of regulation are likely in play. This idea needs to be more fully fleshed out.</p><p>A finding related to &quot;enhancer hubs boosting local concentration&quot; is the finding that an ectopic BAC appears not to influence Ubx concentration in a wild-type <italic>svb</italic> background, only in a deletion background. Does this finding indicate that such hub formation is saturable? And if so, does this indicate that the wild-type <italic>svb</italic> locus forms a local hub with enhancers in the immediate vicinity, and trans-complementation is not a normal feature of <italic>svb</italic> function?</p><p>2) A second point raised concerned the exact cis regulatory regions in play. A minimal <italic>DG3</italic> enhancer drives gene expression in ventral abdominal stripes, but does not rescue Ubx concentrations from a trans setting. A larger deletion that includes <italic>DG3</italic> as well as additional Ubx binding regions (that are not sufficient for, but may be part of, ventral <italic>DG3</italic>-related activity) impacts transcription, trichome development, and robustness. A yet larger cis-regulatory domain on a BAC rescues some aspects of gene expression and Ubx concentration.

This is being actively investigated in a number of systems using both case studies and genome wide methods, and the field is fueled by new capabilities in high resolution microscopy. Thus, interest in the topic is high. However, I have substantial concerns about how this work contributes to this topic.</p><p>The central hypothesis of this work is that increased levels of Ubx, provided by micro-environments created through coalescing multiple Ubx-responsive enhancers, increases the level of transcription of shavenbaby, <italic>svb</italic>; this increased level of transcription allows <italic>svb</italic> expression to be robust to high temperature variation. However, the evidence presented in this paper does not consistently support this hypothesis.</p><p>Let's first consider the set of experiments correlating the presence of the enhancer deletion (via a deficiency), the concentration of Ubx and the level of <italic>svb</italic> transcription.</p><p>– Deleting an <italic>svb</italic> enhancer (<italic>DG3</italic>) decreases resilience to high temperature stress, resulting in smaller numbers of trichomes in A1.</p><p>– In the A1 segment, <italic>svb</italic> enhancers localize to a microenvironment where Ubx concentrations are high compared to background.</p><p>– Deleting an <italic>svb</italic> enhancer decreases the concentration of Ubx in these microenvironments moderately at high temperature, but has no effect at low temperature.</p><p>– At high temperatures, transcription of <italic>svb</italic> decreases at both WT and deficiency alleles.</p><p>– At low temperatures, transcription of <italic>svb</italic> decreases under low temperature stress for the deficiency allele.</p><p>These results do not support the hypothesis because <italic>svb</italic> transcription is not consistently correlated with Ubx levels in the microenvironment.</p><p>A second concern is the interpretation of the rescue experiment, where a BAC containing the full <italic>svb</italic> locus is integrated onto another chromosome. This partially rescues the trichome phenotype of the deficiency allele. However, the Ubx levels in microenvironments were unchanged from WT. If the extra <italic>svb</italic> regulatory region associates with the endogenous <italic>svb</italic> transcription site, this should either result in above WT levels of Ubx, or there is some additional layer of regulation. This was not discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, Tsai et al. studied the general problem of how low affinity binding sites, which promote enhancer specificity, also permit robust activation.

While the specifics are rather specialized, the problem of transcriptional hub formation and robust gene expression is a general problem of importance.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are still specific issues with the main conclusions based on the work presented, which seems somewhat preliminary.</p><p>According to Figure 2, <italic>Df(X)svb<sup>108</sup></italic>removes more than <italic>DG3</italic>, including elements that clearly bind Ubx as per Figure 1—figure supplement 1, so it is not clear if the observed defects can be attributed to loss of <italic>DG3</italic>. Ideally, CRISPR/Cas9 should be used to remove Ubx-bound regions outside <italic>DG3</italic> (e.g. Ubx-bound DG2) and to remove <italic>DG3</italic> specifically, in order to support the conclusions that the observed effects of <italic>Df(X)svb<sup>108</sup></italic> are due to a loss of <italic>DG3</italic>.</p><p><italic>DG3</italic> remains active in the most dorso-lateral cells in Ubx mutant (Figure 1), in a domain that seems to be specifically marked by <italic>DG3</italic> reporters (Figure 1). This domain is portrayed as primarily affected by reduction of trichome formation in <italic>Df(X)svb<sup>108</sup></italic> mutants, but then it is not clear that this defect is due to a lack of Ubx activity on <italic>DG3</italic> (both because <italic>DG3-LacZ</italic> seems to remain active and because the region removed by <italic>Df(X)svb<sup>108</sup></italic>binds Ubx outside <italic>DG3</italic>).</p><p>In Figure 3, the discrepancy between robust accumulation of Ubx, except in <italic>Df(X)svb<sup>108</sup></italic>embryo under stress, and the impact of heat stress on transcription even in wild-type embryos further indicates that changes in Ubx accumulation is only part of the explanation for both the <italic>Df(X)svb<sup>108</sup></italic> phenotype and the response to heat stress.</p><p>The rescue presented in Figure 4 is a strong result but also difficult to interpret: for instance, it seems likely that the &quot;hub&quot; forms independently of Ubx, which presumably cannot accumulate on the <italic>Df(X)svb<sup>108</sup></italic>chromosome, and then help place the <italic>svb</italic> locus in a Ubx-rich microenvironment. This is implied but not explicitly stated, or clearly demonstrated by the data.</p><p>For instance, Figure 5 adds to the notion that regulatory inputs other than <italic>DG3</italic> and Ubx govern the formation of the <italic>svb</italic> containing micro-environment and <italic>svb</italic> transcription. As acknowledged also in the Discussion, robustness of trichome formation also involves mechanisms downstream of <italic>svb</italic> transcription, making the link between Ubx hubs and robust trichome formation even more complex.</p><p>Taken together, a few of the criticisms above question whether the accumulation of Ubx, or the lack thereof, in microenvironments containing the <italic>svb</italic> locus explains the phenotypes described for <italic>Df(X)svb<sup>108</sup></italic>. Rescue experiments more directly combining loss of <italic>DG3</italic> function with gain of Ubx function should help resolve these issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their previous work, Tsai, et al. observed that, during fruit fly embryogenesis, actively transcribing shavenbaby (<italic>svb</italic>) loci preferentially colocalized with regions of elevated concentration for the transcription factor Ubx, a known regulator of <italic>svb</italic> activity. Moreover, they observed that other Ubx target genes exhibited a tendency to colocalize to these same Ubx-enriched &quot;microenvironments&quot;, even when located on different chromosomes. Based on these findings, they hypothesized that the spatial overlap between multiple distal enhancers and transcription factor microenvironments could result in increased transcriptional output and could be a mechanism for redundancy in the face of environmental stresses. In the present work, Tsai, et al. test this hypothesis directly by deleting the <italic>DG3</italic> enhancer from the <italic>svb</italic> cis-regulatory region and assessing the effects on microenvironment formation, <italic>svb</italic> transcription, and trichome number (a phenotype tied to <italic>svb</italic> expression) under normal (25C) and heat-stress (32C) conditions. This manuscript constitutes an intriguing extension of the findings presented in the authors' earlier work on Ubx microenvironments in the vicinity of <italic>svb</italic> loci. They find that the deletion mutant results in a significant depletion in Ubx concentration around the mutated <italic>svb</italic> locus at 32C, and that this depletion coincides with a reduction both in <italic>svb</italic> transcription and trichome number. Furthermore, they find that the addition of the full cis-regulatory region of <italic>svb</italic> on a different chromosome leads to preferential colocalization between the added region and the original mutated <italic>svb</italic> locus. The authors report that local concentration of Ubx in the vicinity of these colocalized enhancer regions recovers to wild-type levels under heat shock. They argue that, consistent with their initial hypothesis, the coincident partial recovery of <italic>svb</italic> transcription and trichome number indicates that this colocalization of multiple Ubx targets to a single microenvironment is indeed functioning to counteract the embryo's mutation-induced sensitivity to heat shock conditions.</p><p>Overall, the new experimental results presented in this work are deeply intriguing and hold the potential to offer significant new insights regarding the physical nature of transcription factor hubs, as well as their functional role in the spatiotemporal control of transcriptional activity. Nonetheless, several key questions remain regarding the interpretation of the experimental data and the proposed functional role of transcriptional microenvironments in facilitating phenotypic robustness in the face of genotypic and environmental perturbations.</p><p>Perhaps most fundamentally, the authors' conclusions hinge upon the assumption that the Ubx enrichment signal they observe at active loci play a causal role in modulating transcriptional activity, yet they present no data to directly support this assumption. Indeed, the box plots in Figure 3 C and D seem to show that, while both Ubx concentration and transcription decrease in response to heat, <italic>DG3</italic> deletion, or both, the relative impacts of these perturbations on transcription and Ubx concentration differ significantly in scale. This leaves open the possibility that the perturbations affect each feature separately, and that the correlation between transcription and local Ubx concentration are spurious, not causal. A simple but important check for this would be to show scatter plots of Ubx concentration vs. <italic>svb</italic> transcription within each condition. If the input concentration and output rate of transcription for a given locus are positively correlated when other conditions are held constant, this would constitute a solid basis for the authors' subsequent arguments. If, on the other hand, no correlation is evident, then this would fundamentally alter how the manuscripts' results are interpreted. This question can be resolved with data already in-hand and, in this reviewer's opinion, it will help clarify the significance of the reported experimental observations. Along similar lines, the strength of the work would benefit from the addition of plots that clarify not only how different variables (concentration, locus colocalization, transcription rate) change across conditions, but also with respect to one another.</p><p>On a more conceptual note, the authors' proposal that the colocalization of enhancers in transcription factor microenvironments could serve as an added layer of redundancy (akin to multiple TF binding sites and multiple enhancers) to increase the transcriptional robustness is thought-provoking. The concept of robustness is used throughout biology with different meanings, and further discussion of the implications and nuances of this proposal would also help establish what exactly the authors mean by it. For instance, what the authors cast as &quot;robustness&quot; could equally well be termed &quot;desensitization&quot;. While robustness to environmental changes could be desirable, the fast pace of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development also necessitates rapid, precise transcriptional responses to changes in transcription factor concentrations. Thus, naively at least, if robustness leads to desensitization of the response of an enhancer to changes in the concentrations of inputs transcription factors, one might expect locus colocalization to actually be deleterious in the case of genes that must respond rapidly to time-varying transcription factor inputs. Augmenting the existing commentary to address this point would help clarify the implications of the present work. Does this trade-off make predictions regarding where and when this kind of clustering might manifest over the course of development (and for what genes)?</p><p>General Comments:</p><p>Can the authors comment on why the box plots in Figure 3 and Figure 4 contain so few data points? All contain 52 or fewer, yet one would expect there to be many more active <italic>svb</italic> loci per embryo at this point in development. If the full set of <italic>svb</italic> loci was not used for the analyses presented, can the authors comment on how the analysis subset was selected. Also, given that many of the effects presented are relatively subtle, the addition of data points (to the extent that it is feasible) would greatly enhance the robustness of the analysis and might lead to the discovery of additional trends within the data not evident in such small sample sizes. Given that the authors get multiple nuclei per embryos, is there a fundamental limitation to how much data they can present such as, for example, their data analysis pipeline?</p><p>As mentioned above, this work leans heavily upon the presumed causal relationship between local Ubx concentration and transcriptional output. The work would be greatly strengthened by the addition of bivariate analyses that rigorously test the relationship between Ubx concentration and transcription within each of the four conditions shown in Figure 3 C and D.</p><p>The boxplots in Figure 4C show that Ubx concentration at loci where the mutated <italic>svb</italic> site is colocalized with the <italic>svbBAC</italic> more or less recovers Ubx concentration at the endogenous (unperturbed) <italic>svb</italic> locus, yet the authors do not address whether the resulting signal is less than, equal to, or greater than the sum of the signal at each locus <italic>(Df(X)svb</italic> and <italic>svbBAC</italic>) when they are not colocalized. Showing how the enrichment signal at colocalized loci compares to the signal at each separately would indicate whether and to what degree some sort of synergy is at play, or whether the increased signal is merely a result of having more Ubx binding sites in region.</p><p>While the trends in Ubx intensity, radial separation, and transcriptional activity shown in Figure 4C, E, and F are interesting taken individually, much more could be learned from the data by making bivariate plots. How does transcriptional output at the mutated <italic>svb</italic> locus vary with the radial separation between loci? What about the Ubx intensity?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45325.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential points to address are the following:</p><p>1) The connection between enhancers, Ubx protein concentration, transcriptional output, and phenotype. Although different concentrations of Ubx are measured at the deleted vs. wild-type locus, an important point that the three reviewers agree upon is that gene expression levels and Ubx concentrations are not well correlated. There appear to be other unexplained factors that are influencing the expression of svb that do not correlate with the TF concentration. Thus, it is unclear whether the experiments described here support or reject the hypothesis laid out in the &quot;multi-enhancer &quot;hubs&quot; improve robustness by increasing transcription factor retention near transcription sites.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct to point out that there are multiple inputs that control the response of the svb locus (Stern and Orgogozo, 2008). Therefore the response function of <italic>svb</italic> could have a positive but complicated relationship to Ubx concentrations and would depend on more than Ubx alone. We now state this in the second paragraph of the Discussion. However, Ubx is a crucial driver of <italic>svb</italic> and, specifically, also <italic>DG3</italic> expression in the ventral region of the A1 segment (Crocker et al., 2015) and Figure 1 of this manuscript. We specifically focused most of our analyses and quantifications in A1. We now state this in the Results section, “Transcription sites from the <italic>DG3</italic>‐ deletion allele have weaker Ubx microenvironment and lower transcriptional output”.</p><p>Within this specific body segment, Ubx intensity near <italic>svb</italic> transcription sites would be a reasonable metric of how local transcription factor concentrations changed when we perturbed the system through mutations and elevated temperature. We now state this in the Results section “Transcription sites from the <italic>DG3</italic>‐deletion allele have weaker Ubx microenvironment and lower transcriptional output”. With these caveats in mind, we did observe increased Ubx concentrations and around the wildtype <italic>svb</italic> transcription sites (Figure 3C, lower right panel) compared to the deletion allele, and increased phenotype resilience for the wildtype allele at 32 °C. In the <italic>svbBAC</italic> rescue, we also observed that colocalized <italic>svbBAC</italic> and <italic>DG3</italic>‐deleted <italic>svb</italic> allele had both higher Ubx concentrations and <italic>svb</italic> transcriptional outputs (Figure 4F). We, therefore, believe that our results support the idea that multi enhancer hubs help transcriptional factor retention and can ultimately lead to a more robust phenotype. We believe the analysis that the reviewers suggested below also supports our hypothesis of improved transcriptional factor retention with complexed enhancers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors must consider further whether the global measurements shown in Figure 3 are the most effective measure of this proposed correlation, or whether a more fine-grained analysis might support the idea that boosted Ubx levels from complexed enhancers are driving transcription. As noted below, the authors might show scatter plots of Ubx concentration vs. svb transcription within each condition. A positive correlation would support their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the analysis in Figure 3C to show <italic>svb</italic> transcription vs. Ubx intensity. There is initially a positive correlation between svb transcriptional output and Ubx intensity, in line with the reviewers’ proposal. This trend dissipates at higher Ubx and <italic>svb</italic> intensities, indicating that the response of <italic>svb</italic> output to Ubx concentration is not a simple relationship. Capturing the exact dependence of transcriptional output on Ubx concentration is difficult for the reasons we stated in the second paragraph of the Discussion (e.g., multiple binding sites in enhancers and overlapping expression patterns). To fully address this would require future live imaging experiments that can track the gene locus regardless of its transcriptional state, in addition to reporting on its transcriptional activity and transcription factors around it. Numerous new reagents (fly lines, tagged proteins, etc.) are being developed in the lab to address this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The trichome phenotype is also not directly correlated to the transcriptional outputs and Ubx concentrations, and as mentioned in the Discussion, further layers of regulation are likely in play. This idea needs to be more fully fleshed out.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have a new figure (Figure 6) summarizing our hypothesis and referred to this figure throughout the Discussion to clarify our proposed mechanism. In short, we propose in our revised Discussion that 1) the relationship between Ubx concentration and <italic>svb</italic> transcriptional output is positive but complex, likely involving additional factors (paragraph two) and 2) the relationship between <italic>svb</italic> transcriptional output and phenotype is sigmoidal (paragraph four) and the wild‐type system operates in a saturated regime under ideal conditions (paragraph five). The processes leading to the response functions in 1 and the phenotypical tolerance to a range of <italic>svb</italic> out in 2 remain to be investigated (paragraphs two and five), specifically with live imaging approaches. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, work is currently ongoing in the lab to address this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A finding related to &quot;enhancer hubs boosting local concentration&quot; is the finding that an ectopic BAC appears not to influence Ubx concentration in a wild-type svb background, only in a deletion background. Does this finding indicate that such hub formation is saturable? And if so, does this indicate that the wild-type svb locus forms a local hub with enhancers in the immediate vicinity, and trans-complementation is not a normal feature of svb function?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that hub formation is saturable, based on this observation. We also believe that local hub formation with the <italic>cis</italic>‐regulatory region of the wildtype svb is sufficiently in saturation to deal with environmental challenges as seen in trichome numbers. We now state this in the Discussion (paragraph five). Our data, however, does not provide a direct answer as to if trans‐ chromosomal interactions are a normal feature of <italic>svb</italic> or other genes. Ongoing efforts in the lab to characterize and map these long‐range interactions through imaging and genomics approaches should shed light on their functional impact during development in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second point raised concerned the exact cis regulatory regions in play. A minimal DG3 enhancer drives gene expression in ventral abdominal stripes, but does not rescue Ubx concentrations from a trans setting. A larger deletion that includes DG3 as well as additional Ubx binding regions (that are not sufficient for, but may be part of, ventral DG3-related activity) impacts transcription, trichome development, and robustness. A yet larger cis-regulatory domain on a BAC rescues some aspects of gene expression and Ubx concentration. The interpretation conflates DG3 with the function of the deleted region; reviewers noted that a more careful interpretation would differentiate results from each of these different cis elements. For instance, the lack of trans-rescue by the DG3 enhancer alone may be due to the inability of a short segment to transvect effectively. The interpretation should explicitly take into account known properties of transvecting regulatory loci in Drosophila.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we should take into account the efficiency of the rescue locus in finding the <italic>svb</italic> locus as an important factor in if phenotype rescue takes place. We now state that <italic>DG3</italic> alone as the rescue locus might have failed due to its inability to pair with the <italic>svb</italic> locus in the Discussion (paragraph four). We also now compare and contrast the <italic>svbBAC</italic>‐<italic>svb</italic> interactions that we observed with transvection and hypothesize that the addition of other topological elements such as insulator to <italic>DG3</italic> could overcome this problem (paragraph four). We further state that the <italic>svbBAC</italic> did not rescue trichomes in regions where <italic>DG3</italic> provided exclusive coverage, suggesting that the rescue BAC rescued the phenotype by overdriving the other ventral enhancers <italic>E3</italic> and <italic>7</italic> rather than directly restoring <italic>DG3</italic> function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Several aspects can be addressed by better justification and explanation of methods and data presentation, including</p><p>– Why sometimes either A1 or A2 trichomes are quantitatively assessed, depending on the figure;</p></disp-quote><p>This issue was an oversight on our part, and we have updated all the main figures where we counted trichomes to be from the A1 segment for consistency. We moved data from the A2 segment to figure supplements as they also show a similar but weaker trend as in A1. We speculate that this is due to additional factors at work as <italic>DG3</italic> in the A2 segment responds to additional inputs beyond Ubx, as explained in the Results section “The <italic>DG3</italic> enhancer responds specifically to Ubx in the A1 segment”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The use of one-tailed (vs. two-tailed) T-tests for statistical relevance;</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed our test to two‐tailed T‐tests throughout, as is the standard.

We did not conduct <italic>svbBAC</italic> rescue experiments at 25 C as neither the wildtype nor the deletion allele displayed reduced trichome numbers (phenotype output), and the difference between the Ubx intensities (molecular input) around transcription sites of both genotypes was small at this temperature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Clarification of exact role of Ubx in T1-T3 regulation, as the conclusions drawn about DG3 and Ubx roles are difficult to know based on the single images shown,</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers noticed, the role of Ubx in regulating <italic>svb</italic>, and <italic>DG3</italic> specifically, on the ventral surface in segments outside of A1 is more complicated (Figure 1B‐E). <italic>DG3</italic> expression in the thoracic segments T1‐T3 overlaps with other ventral <italic>svb</italic> enhancers and responds to changes in Ubx level less that in the A1 segment. T2 and T3 also show only low levels of expression from <italic>DG3</italic> on the ventral surface with wild‐type Ubx expression. This issue potentially introduces many confounding factors for quantitation. We have thus confined ourselves to qualitative descriptions of <italic>DG3</italic> properties outside of A1 and A2. We now state this concern at several places in the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The number of data points in Figures 3 and 4 are limited; is there a technical limitation to more extensive sampling of the transcriptional readouts and Ubx intensities?</p></disp-quote><p>In the process of doing the additional analysis suggested by the review, we added more data points, and the number of transcription sites and embryos quantified is comparable to the original publication this manuscript is linked to (Tsai et al., 2017).

The number observed for colocalized sites is also similar to our previous publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In some cases, the actual experimental approach was unclear to the reviewers:</p><p>– There was some confusion about whether the DG3 deletion mutants were homozygous, so there would be no wild-type copy of the gene in these embryos – is that indeed the case?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we selected larvae or embryos homozygous for the <italic>Df(X)svb<sup>108</sup></italic>allele based on the following phenotype in the T1 segment: the lack of trichomes or the lack of <italic>svb</italic> mRNA expression, respectively. This is a homozygous marker for the deletion allele as the wild‐type <italic>svb</italic> allele expresses in this segment. This was mentioned in “Deletion of a region including <italic>DG3</italic> enhancer causes defects in ventral trichome formation specifically at elevated temperatures” in Results, “Preparing <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos for staining and cuticle preps” in Materials and methods and the legends for Figure 2C in our original manuscript (2E in the revised version,). We have now made it explicit in the Results that we use this to select for animals homozygous for the deletion for both counting trichome number and for confocal imaging. It is now also described in both “Cuticle preparations and trichome counting” and “Imaging fixed embryos” in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4 shows svb, but not dsRed mRNA expression; is that correct?
