critical roles in maintaining genome stability. It processes distinct DNA substrates, but not nicked DNA, during many steps in DNA replication and repair. However, how BLM prepares itself for diverse functions remains elusive. Here, using a combined single-molecule approach, we find that a high abundance of BLMs can indeed unidirectionally unwind dsDNA from a nick when an external destabilizing force is applied. Strikingly, human replication protein A (hRPA) not only ensures that limited quantities of BLMs processively unwind nicked dsDNA under a reduced force but also permits the translocation of BLMs on both intact and nicked ssDNAs, resulting in a bidirectional unwinding mode. This activation necessitates BLM targeting on the nick and the presence of free hRPAs in solution whereas direct interactions between them are dispensable. Our findings present novel DNA unwinding activities of BLM that potentially facilitate its function switching in DNA repair.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BLM</kwd><kwd>RPA</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd><kwd>optical tweezers</kwd><kwd>DNA unwinding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0500902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0106700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007219</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19ZR1434100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PLBIO2017-167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Modesti</surname><given-names>Mauro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The French National League Against Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EL2028.LNCC/MaM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Modesti</surname><given-names>Mauro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>hRPA permits the BLM helicase to bidirectionally unwind DNA from a nick which could potentially facilitate its function switching in DNA repair and promote end resection in homologous recombination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA helicases are ubiquitous motor proteins that couple the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) to the unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), providing the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) required for many biological processes, including DNA replication, repair and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>). Among these DNA helicases, the RecQ family helicases have been highly conserved during evolution from prokaryotes to humans and play critical roles in genome maintenance and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Croteau et al., 2014</xref>). Defects in three of the five human RecQ members (BLM, WRN and RECQ4) give rise to distinct heritable human disease syndromes (Bloom’s, Werner’s and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes, respectively), characterized by genomic instability and an increased incidence of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kitao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu et al., 1996</xref>). These genetic linkages underscore the importance of the RecQ family helicases in cellular homeostasis. Thus, an in-depth understanding of their unwinding mechanisms at the molecular level may inform potential therapeutic strategies.</p><p>Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) is one of the five RecQ family helicases that unwind DNA in a 3’−5’ direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Croteau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karow et al., 1997</xref>). It is involved in many aspects of genome maintenance, including DNA end resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kowalczykowski, 2015</xref>), displacement-loop (D-loop) processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bugreev et al., 2007</xref>), rescuing stalled or collapsed replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2007</xref>), and resolution of Holliday junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bizard and Hickson, 2014</xref>). BLM’s diverse functions are realized by its remarkable unwinding capabilities of many unique DNA structures, such as G-quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, BLM has been verified to participate in many steps in repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via homologous recombination (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nimonkar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nimonkar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sturzenegger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woglar and Villeneuve, 2018</xref>). It has been demonstrated to be recruited to the DSB ends and facilitate resection of the 5’ termini to generate 3’ end protruding ssDNAs in the first step of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gravel et al., 2008</xref>). BLM either unwinds dsDNA to provide ssDNA for exonuclease resection by EXO1 or DNA2 or directly stimulates their nucleolytic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nimonkar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sturzenegger et al., 2014</xref>). Paradoxically, even though BLM is distinctive in preferentially unwinding unique substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mohaghegh et al., 2001</xref>), an in vitro ensemble study has demonstrated that this helicase alone is unable to initiate dsDNA unwinding from a nick which is a prevalent and essential DNA intermediate during HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maizels and Davis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mohaghegh et al., 2001</xref>). These contradictory findings may be reconciled by BLM’s varying unwinding activities, which are often regulated by other in vivo factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Croteau et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It has been widely appreciated that the BLM helicase interacts and collaborates with many protein partners to aid in cellular responses to replication stress and DNA damage in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Croteau et al., 2014</xref>). These interactions and collaborations dictate BLM’s specialized functions in genome maintenance. A key partner of BLM is the single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein, replication protein A (RPA), a heterotrimeric protein complex consisting of the RPA70, RPA32 and RPA14 subunits, which is also essential in DNA repair and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fanning et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wold, 1997</xref>). A recent in vivo study directly demonstrated that RPA co-localizes with BLM at the foci of DNA damage, suggesting that these two proteins coordinate and function together in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woglar and Villeneuve, 2018</xref>). In addition, biochemical, structural and single-molecule studies have revealed that RPA not only physically interacts with BLM but also stimulates its unwinding activity by increasing its processivity or improving its unwinding initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brosh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doherty et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Soniat et al., 2019</xref>). The poor ability of a heterologous SSB protein to stimulate BLM’s unwinding further suggests that this stimulation is specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brosh et al., 2000</xref>). These findings, coupled with the inability of BLM alone to unwind a nicked DNA in vitro, suggest that RPA might also promote BLM in unwinding nicked dsDNA to facilitate efficient end resection in HR. A thorough understanding of how BLM-mediated DNA unwinding is regulated by RPA would advance our knowledge in its diverse roles and functions in genome maintenance.</p><p>In this study, by combining optical tweezers with confocal fluorescence microscopy, we examined BLM unwinding activities under various conditions at the single-molecule level. We found that, in the absence of hRPA, BLM at high concentrations can unwind dsDNA from a nick unidirectionally with a requirement of an external destabilizing force on the DNA template. Surprisingly, the presence of hRPA permits BLM’s unwinding in two opposite directions from a nick at low and zero forces. This stimulation demands free hRPAs in solution, suggesting that the coating of hRPA on the newly generated ssDNA is essential for enhancing BLM unwinding activity. These findings reveal a distinct SSB-enabled helicase unwinding mode that might facilitate the generation of the 3’ ssDNA tail in HR. Additionally, this study demonstrates various DNA unwinding activities by BLM that are regulated by tension on DNA, the concentration of BLM, and the presence of RPA, which provide a molecular insight into how BLM realizes its diverse biological functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Force assists BLM’s unidirectional unwinding from a nick</title><p>We combined dual-optical traps with confocal microscopy to monitor unwinding of a single DNA molecule by wild type (WT) <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> BLM (gBLM). gBLM (hereafter referred to as BLM) has two similar RPA binding domains to the human BLM (hBLM) and the sequence of its helicase-core domain (core-gBLM) has an 80% identity with the one from hBLM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows a schematic of our experimental configuration in which a λ phage DNA molecule is suspended between one fixed trap and one steered trap via two streptavidin-coated microspheres, while a confocal laser repeatedly scanned along the plane of the DNA template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A high-frequency feedback system on the steered trap was employed to ensure the force on the DNA template remained constant, while BLM unwound the DNA template. The difference in extension between ssDNA and dsDNA under tension would result in a change in DNA length once the BLM helicase started unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bustamante et al., 2003</xref>), thus allowing for monitoring of its unwinding activity. In addition, the fluorescent binding agent Sytox was used as a dsDNA probe, and its immediate dissociation led by converting dsDNA to ssDNA by BLM served as an additional signal for dsDNA unwinding. This combined single-molecule technique allowed us not only to record the change of DNA length induced by BLM-catalyzed dsDNA unwinding but also to directly visualize individual unwinding events and DNA intermediates along the DNA template.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BLM unwinds dsDNA unidirectionally from a nick.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A Schematic of the experimental configuration.

In the presence of 20 nM BLM, apparent dsDNA unwinding was not observed over a broad force range from 10 pN to 40 pN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, at a high BLM concentration of 200 nM, one or few unwinding events on a single DNA molecule were recorded once the force was increased to a range of 10–40 pN in all examined traces (n = 30) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows a kymograph of a DNA molecule and the force and DNA length as a function of time in the presence of 200 nM BLM: DNA length and fluorescence signals did not change under 10 or 20 pN; however, the DNA length displayed a continuous increase while a dark region in the middle of the fluorescent dsDNA appeared and subsequently expanded just after the force was increased to 30 pN. Omitting ATP did not result in changes in either fluorescence or DNA length signal in this experimental condition, confirming that our observations were a result of BLM-catalyzed dsDNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Control experiments without Sytox exhibited similar DNA length increases in the presence of BLM, suggesting that the fluorescent dye does not affect BLM’s unwinding activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>As nicks can be accidently generated along the long λ phage DNA template used in these assays, the observed dsDNA unwinding by BLM could be initiated either from a nick or from an intact duplex region melted internally, leading to distinct DNA intermediates during unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rad et al., 2015</xref>). To differentiate between these two possibilities, we analyzed the fluorescence signal of each individual unwinding event. In all 49 examined events from 33 traces, the unwinding progressed in one direction only, as reflected by the progression of the dark region of the fluorescence signal as well as the biased disappearance of its adjacent dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This finding is not consistent with the possibility that the observed dsDNA unwinding was initiated by melting dsDNA internally where bidirectional progression of the unwinding fork movement was expected. Thus, we attributed these events to dsDNA unwinding initiated from a nick and the appearance and subsequent growth of the dark regions along the DNA track represented ssDNA. The rate of each unwinding fork movement was determined from the increase in ssDNA length revealed by the fluorescence signal and was converted to unwound base pair per second based on the elasticity of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This yielded an unwinding rate of 60 ± 9 bp/s (mean ± SD) under 30 pN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the BLM helicase at a high concentration is indeed able to perform unidirectional unwinding from a nick, but this requires exerting an external destabilizing force (tens of pN) on the DNA template.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BLM translocates on intact ssDNA during unidirectional unwinding</title><p>Our data suggest that the BLM helicase unwinds dsDNA unidirectionally from a nick. This generates one intact strand under tension and one relaxed coiled strand in our experimental configuration. Since BLM unwinds by translocating on ssDNA in a 3’ to 5’ manner, we next sought to determine on which strand BLM prefers to translocate when initiating unwinding from a nick. This strand preference directly determines BLM’s unwinding polarity from a single nick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, we designed a 6.4 kbp dsDNA harboring a single nick at 2.2 kbp and 4.2 kbp away from the 5’ and the 3’ ends, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). BLM unwinds a 4.2 kbp dsDNA region if it translocates on the tensioned strand during unwinding or a 2.2 kbp dsDNA region if it translocates on the relaxed strand. To ensure the occurrence of DNA unwinding, we conducted the unwinding assay with this nicked DNA template under 30 pN. We found that 25 traces out of 29 examined DNA molecules showed continuous DNA unwinding from the nick. The 4.2 kbp dsDNA segments in these 25 traces were always unwound while the 2.2 kbp dsDNA segments remained intact, independent of the orientation of the suspended nicked DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These findings suggest that BLM exclusively employed the intact ssDNA under tension as the track strand to unwind dsDNA. In addition, the inability of BLM to unwind the 2.2 kbp dsDNA segment reinforced our conclusion that BLM alone unwinds unidirectionally from a nick.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>BLM unwinds DNA template containing a single nick.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two models of BLM unwinding dsDNA from a nick.

To determine that, we labeled the RPA with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and repeated the unwinding experiments. This eGFP-RPA allowed for the direct visualization of the unwinding intermediates of ssDNA instead of dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">King et al., 2013</xref>). If dsDNA unwinding is initiated from melted regions of dsDNA, two continuous ssDNA strands under tension would be expected, and no frayed relaxed ssDNA exists. However, in most examined unwinding events (90%, n = 95), we observed at least one bright spot locating at the end of the newly generated tensioned ssDNA under 30 pN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These spots increased in intensity as the unwinding fork progressed, and are thus attributed to unwound coiled ssDNA coated by RPA. These observations support the interpretation that the RPA-stimulated DNA unwinding by BLM is initiated from a nick instead of internally melted dsDNA regions. Moreover, 23 unwinding events were marked with two spots on both ends of an ssDNA, progressing in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These observations can be interpreted as BLM helicases unwind two opposite DNA forks by translocating on tensioned ssDNA in one direction and on relaxed ssDNA in the other, further strengthening our conclusion that that RPA activates BLM’s bidirectional unwinding. Intriguingly, both Sytox and eGFP signals indicated that the bidirectional unwinding only initiates from a nick instead of starting an opposite unwinding direction in the middle of an ongoing unidirectional unwinding. The average bidirectional unwinding rate (117 ± 25 bp/s, mean ± SD) was 1.6-fold higher than that of the unidirectional unwinding (72 ± 24 bp/s, mean ± SD) which is slightly faster than that with BLM alone (60 ± 9 bp/s, mean ± SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). These findings indicate that the unwinding rates for both directions might be a little different. As the opposite DNA unwinding forks differ in that BLMs translocate on relaxed and tensioned ssDNAs, we reasoned that the tension on the ssDNA might modulate BLM unwinding activity a bit. Notably, bidirectional DNA unwinding events were also observable under low and zero external forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To rule out that the observed bidirectional DNA unwinding was due to the heterologous combination of gBLM and hRPA, we also conducted the DNA unwinding experiments by using hBLM.

A few potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain how RPA stimulates helicase unwinding of long duplex dsDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Awate and Brosh (2017)</xref>. RPA may enhance BLM-catalyzed DNA unwinding by coating the unwound ssDNAs and relieving the pressure from their reannealing to prolong BLM tethering at the ssDNA/dsDNA junction during unwinding of relatively long duplexes. Alternatively, RPA coated onto ssDNA at the fork junction may help recruit additional BLM helicases from solution to aid in duplex unwinding. To examine these possibilities, we conducted a BLM unwinding experiment in a microfluidic system which allows for the rapid switching of experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In one channel, we first started the dsDNA unwinding by using 20 nM BLM and 50 nM RPA at 30 pN to ensure the initiation of dsDNA unwinding from a nick. Following that, we depleted the free proteins in solution by rapidly transporting the DNA tether to an ATP-containing reaction buffer channel. We found that, in the buffer channel, the DNA length slowly decreased and the dark region along the DNA template gradually disappeared, indicating the reannealing of the unwound ssDNA (n = 30, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This transition from DNA unwinding to rewinding is a result of the dissociation of ssDNA coated RPA and is possibly due to BLM strand switching and/or dissociation. This observation suggests that either free RPAs or BLMs are indispensable for the processive unwinding. To further determine that, we transported BLM/RPA-initiated DNA unwinding template to a channel containing either BLM or RPA. In these experiments, we observed that up to 75% of traces (n = 53) in the following RPA channel continued DNA unwinding, and yet only 16% of traces showed continuous unwinding in the BLM channel (n = 38) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>).

These findings favor the model that ssDNA generated by BLM was immediately coated by free RPA, preventing the separated ssDNAs from reannealing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There are several lines of evidence supporting that unwinding activities of the RecQ family helicases can be regulated by the presence of SSB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Awate and Brosh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mills et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xue et al., 2019a</xref>). Herein, our experimental approach combining optical tweezers with fluorescence microscopy has shed new light on the effect of RPA on BLM’s ability to catalyze dsDNA unwinding. This combined technique allows for the direct monitoring of individual unwinding events by BLM along tensioned dsDNA in real time, leading to the discovery of a distinct unwinding mode. In this mode, RPA activates BLM’s bidirectional unwinding from a nick where BLMs can translocate on both relaxed and tensioned ssDNAs during unwinding. This is the first observation, to our knowledge, of helicase bidirectional unwinding from a nick. Previous studies of replicative and DNA repair helicases have reported bidirectional unwinding attributable to helicase melting dsDNA internally, which differs from our observed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yardimci et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of RPA, BLM alone can only initiate unidirectional dsDNA unwinding from a nick where it translocates on the ssDNA with the assistance of an external destabilizing force on DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the physical barriers presented by dsDNA on both directions from a nick are similar, the inability of BLM to unwind in the opposite direction is mostly likely due to the lack of tension on the relaxed ssDNA which might possibly promote the unwinding activity of BLM. This unidirectional unwinding on nicked dsDNA by BLM alone occurred with the high protein concentrations. The core-BLM lacking the oligomerization domain also exhibited unidirectional unwinding from a nick in the absence of RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karow et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shi et al., 2017a</xref>), leading us to exclude the possibility that processive unwinding could depend on oligomerization of the protein. Instead, proteins at high concentrations might ensure sufficient binding of the enzyme to the ssDNA generated during an unwinding event, allowing for successive rounds of unwinding and preventing the unwound strands against reannealing.</p><p>A distinct feature of the bidirectional dsDNA unwinding by BLM and RPA is that the unwinding directionality is determined initially at a nick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The sequential protein incubation assays demonstrated that, once preloaded with BLM, only free RPAs are indispensable for activating the bidirectional dsDNA unwinding, suggesting that only limited BLMs are required to first recognize and load on the nicked dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that the bidirectional unwinding necessitates the preloading of more than one helicase at the nick and subsequent binding of RPA on the newly generated ssDNA prolongs the binding and unwinding of BLM at the fork. The unidirectional unwinding probably results from only one BLM helicase preloading at the nick and the inability of BLM to associate with RPA-coated ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xue et al., 2019a</xref>). This speculation could also explain a recent single-molecule observation that only unidirectional DNA unwinding by BLM and RPA was detected wherein low concentrations of BLM were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xue et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>Our study also provided insights into the mechanisms by which BLM and RPA cooperate to facilitate end resection in HR. Recent studies support a model that the long-range end resection in HR initiates from a nick generated by the MRN/X complex once the DSB ends are coated by DNA adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cannavo and Cejka, 2014</xref>). This demands that the helicase and the nuclease unwind and resect bidirectionally from a nick. It is highly likely that the abilities of BLM to recognize and preload on the nick would help identify the locations of DSB and possibly play a role in recruiting other required proteins for the resection. Although it needs to be further validated, the inherent ability of BLM and RPA to unwind bidirectionally from a nick would facilitate the resection by DNA adduct coated DSB ends which provides ssDNA for the DNA2/EXO1 nucleases to degrade from 5’ to 3’ and the MRN complex to degrade from 3’ to 5’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Symington, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, inhibition of MRN exonuclease activity only confers a relatively lower resection defect compared with the inhibition of its endonuclease activity, suggesting that other proteins might also participate in the initial short ssDNA generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shibata et al., 2014</xref>). In support of this notion, the complete unwinding of the short dsDNA between the nick and the DSB end may serve as an additional pathway in generating the short stretches of ssDNA.</p><p>The finding that the SSB proteins promote helicase-catalyzed dsDNA unwinding from a nick might be conserved among the RecQ-like helicases. For example, the RecQ helicase from <italic>E. coli</italic> is also able to promote dsDNA unwinding in both directions in the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rad et al., 2015</xref>). However, its bidirectional unwinding was initiated by melting dsDNA internally instead of a nick, which resembles replicative helicases in DNA replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mott and Berger, 2007</xref>). In fact, the unwinding by RecQ progresses unidirectionally if initiated from a nick. In addition, the Sgs1 helicase, the S<italic>accharomyces cerevisiae</italic> homologue of BLM, was also found to unwind dsDNA from blunt-ended termini or a nick with RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xue et al., 2019b</xref>), but its unwinding directionality when initiated from a nick has not been determined. A previous single-molecule FRET study revealed that BLM could not unwind more than 34 bp even in the presence of RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yodh et al., 2009</xref>). This difference may be due to the fact that the action of applied force on the DNA template can lower the energy required to melt the DNA and prevent reannealing of the separated strands, thus stimulating BLM’s unwinding activity. Given the fact that hRPA can activate hBLM's, gBLM's and core-gBLM's bidirectional unwinding form a nick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), this activation might be a conserved feature for the SSB proteins and the RecQ helicases and does not require a homologous system or physical interactions between them.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

In brief, a 1,064 nm fiber laser and a water-immersion objective were used to create two orthogonally polarized optical traps. The trap separation was controlled using a piezo mirror for beam-steering one trap. Force measurements were performed by back-focal plane interferometry of the condenser top lens using a position-sensitive detector. A computer-controlled stage enabled rapid movement of the optical traps within a multiple-channel flow cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This flow cell allowed for the rapid in situ construction and characterization of dumbbell constructs, and facilitated the swift and complete transfer of the tethered DNA between different flow channels.</p><p>As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gross et al., 2010</xref>), DNA molecules were captured between two streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads (1.76 μm for 6.4 kbp DNA and 4.5 μm for λ phage DNA) using the multichannel laminar flow cell and tensioned by increasing the distance between the optical traps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

First, gBLM is an ortholog of human BLM (hBLM) and shares high similarity with hBLM. gBLM has two similar RPA binding domains to the hBLM (Kang et al. 2018) and the sequence of the core gBLM has an 80% identity with the one from hBLM. Second, we have successfully over-expressed and purified gBLM with high purity (Shi et al., <italic>2017</italic>) and biochemical studies with gBLM also showed similar results with hBLM (Shi et al., 2017). Thus, we chose to mainly use gBLM in our previous study to investigate how hRPA stimulates its unwinding.</p><p>After reading the comment, we agree with the reviewers and the editor on that the experiments with hBLM are more physiologically relevant and necessary to further strengthen our conclusions. Following that, we have conducted an additional set of experiments. Frist, we performed a similar DNA unwinding assay with WT hBLM alone and observed only unidirectional unwinding events initiated from nicks. Second, we conducted experiments with hBLM and hRPA. In this assay, a similar bidirectional DNA unwinding was observable by using Sytox as a probe. Third, to further verify the bidirectional unwinding is initiated from a nick. We used eGFP-hRPA to indicate the unwinding intermediates of ssDNA in the presence of hBLM. Consistently, the observed bidirectional unwinding events were often accompanied with one or two bright spots at the end of the newly generated ssDNA, indicating that the DNA unwinding was also initiated from a nick in this experimental condition. This new set of experiments with hBLM reinforces our findings that RPA can activate BLM’s bidirectional unwinding from a nick and rules out the observed bidirectional DNA unwinding was an artificial result of the heterologous combination of gBLM and hRPA. We have added this set of data as Figure 4—figure supplement 3 and also incorporated this information in the revised manuscript by stating:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“To rule out that the observed bidirectional DNA unwinding was due to the heterologous combination of gBLM and hRPA, we also conducted the DNA unwinding experiments by using hBLM. When testing the homologous pair of hBLM and hRPA, results similar to the heterologous combination were obtained: hBLM alone initiates unidirectional unwinding from a nick and hRPA activates its bidirectional unwinding (Figure 4—figure supplement 3).”2) A complementary biochemical in vitro experiment is necessary to establish that the bidirectional unwinding can indeed take place in the absence of force. Extrapolation of the rate of initiation dependence on force to zero force may be another way to address this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion and would be more than happy to answer this question by conducting new experiments. We first tried to address whether BLM and RPA can unwind DNA in the absence of any externally applied force by employing an in vitro ensemble assay. However, as BLM and RPA can also initiate the DNA unwinding from the blunt-ended termini (Figure 3B) which raises difficulties in the experimental design and data analysis. Instead, we designed a single-molecule assay to answer this question. In this assay, we first incubated a relaxed DNA tether (under zero force) in a BLM and eGFP-hRPA channel for a short period time. Following that, we transported the DNA tether to a buffer channel wherein no unwinding occurred because of the absence of BLM, RPA and ATP. In this channel, we examined the fluorescence signal of eGFP-hRPA along the DNA tether under 10 pN. We found the existence of the unwound ssDNA on the tensioned DNA as well as one or two bright spots at the end of the newly generated ssDNA. This results strongly suggest that BLM and RPA can indeed unwind dsDNA from a nick in the absence of external force. We have added this set of data as Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and also incorporated this information in the revised manuscript by stating:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Moreover, we demonstrated that BLM/RPA-mediated DNA unwinding can even take place in the absence of any externally applied force (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).” and “Notably, bidirectional DNA unwinding events were also observable under low and zero external forces (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2).”Other important issues to address:3) It is unclear how many nicks are present on each λ DNA molecule, which complicates the analysis of the initiation rate.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being explicit on describing our experiment. For the experiments with λ DNA, we can detect unwinding events along the template but not the number of nicks on it. In other words, the nicks that were not used to initiate dsDNA unwinding cannot be detected. Thus, it is impossible to analyze the initiation rate by using this DNA template. However, we can indeed calculate the initiation rate by the experiments with the 6.4 kbp DNA template which contains a single nick. In the presence of BLM alone, 25 traces in all 29 examined DNA tethers (86%) were found to be unwound from the single nick. In the presence of BLM and RPA, we found that nearly all examined DNA molecules (26 out of 27 examined traces) were unwound from the nick.
