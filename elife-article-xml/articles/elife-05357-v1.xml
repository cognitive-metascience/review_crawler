conditions. The branched character of their respiratory chains allows bacteria to do so by providing a great metabolic and regulatory flexibility. Here, we show that the native localization of the nitrate reductase, a major respiratory complex under anaerobiosis in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, is submitted to tight spatiotemporal regulation in response to metabolic conditions via a mechanism using the transmembrane proton gradient as a cue for polar localization. These dynamics are critical for controlling the activity of nitrate reductase, as the formation of polar assemblies potentiates the electron flux through the complex. Thus, dynamic subcellular localization emerges as a critical factor in the control of respiration in bacteria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05357.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05357.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05357.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Respiration occurs at different levels: the body, the organ, and the cells. At the cellular level, it is a molecular process that produces a high-energy molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using the biochemical energy stored in sugars, fatty acids, and other nutrients. Along with the ATP, this process also provides another source of energy to the cell: an electrochemical gradient across the membrane used for a range of processes ranging from the transport of molecules and ions to cell motility.</p><p>In order to thrive, cells need to quickly respond to cues from the environment or elsewhere in the cell. A cell must therefore have the ability to increase or decrease cellular respiration and the production of ATP to ensure it has an appropriate supply of energy. In bacteria, the protein complexes responsible for cellular respiration are embedded in the cell membrane. In the past decade, research has suggested that large molecules are arranged in a specific way throughout the bacterial cell, which directly influences how they work.</p><p>Alberge et al. tested this idea by studying the localization of a respiratory complex called nitrate reductase—which is important for generating energy in the absence of oxygen—through the introduction of a fluorescent marker tagged to the complex in the cell membrane of a rod-shaped bacterium called <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. This allowed the complex to be tracked when the cells were viewed using a microscope. The experiments revealed that the location of the complex varies depending on how much energy the cell requires. For example, when the cells are in an oxygen-poor environment, the nitrate reductase complex moves towards the poles at each end of the bacterial cells. This allows the cells to produce ATP more efficiently through respiration of nitrate. Alberge et al. show that a ‘proton gradient’, caused by positively charged hydrogen ions moving through the cell membrane as the result of respiration, controls where the complexes are located in the membrane.</p><p>Alberge et al.'s findings provide experimental support that dynamic localization of respiratory complexes plays an important role in controlling respiration in bacteria. The next challenge will be to identify the genes that influence the distribution of respiratory complexes throughout the cell, which may help to explain how bacterial cells have adapted to specific environments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05357.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05357.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>nitrate reductase</kwd><kwd>protonmotive force</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09-BLAN-0100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sylvi</surname><given-names>Léa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004792</institution-id><institution>Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alberge</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espinosa</surname><given-names>Leon</given-names></name><name><surname>Seduk</surname><given-names>Farida</given-names></name><name><surname>Toci</surname><given-names>René</given-names></name><name><surname>Walburger</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Magalon</surname><given-names>Axel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The localization of respiratory complexes in the cell membrane emerges as a critical factor for controlling respiration in bacteria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Respiration is an essential process for most living organisms. The free energy derived from oxidation of reducing equivalents generated by cell metabolism or taken up from the environment is converted into a protonmotive force (<italic>pmf</italic>) across a membrane that is used, among many processes, to drive adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Although oxygen is the most common terminal electron acceptor of respiratory chains, prokaryotes can make use of alternative acceptors in anoxic environments, such as nitrogen oxides, elemental sulfur and sulfur oxyanions, organic N-oxides, etc. In eukaryotes, respiration is confined to a specific organelle, the mitochondrion and more specifically to its inner membrane which displays remarkably intricate ultra-structural features that impact the respiratory output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cogliati et al., 2013</xref>). Respiration involves multimeric membrane-embedded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes which bear several metal cofactors through which electrons are transported. The organization of OXPHOS complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane has been the subject of intense debate during the last decade after the discovery of supramolecular assemblies by the landmark study of Schägger in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schägger and Pfeiffer, 2000</xref>), later substantiated by electron microscopy studies (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vonck and Schafer, 2009</xref>). Plasticity of the almost linear mitochondrial OXPHOS chain is ensured by a dynamic equilibrium between isolated complexes and supramolecular assemblies which is, in turn, influenced by both specific lipids and stabilizing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ikeda et al., 2013</xref>). Such an equilibrium is likely beneficial for the function of the mitochondrion allowing the cell to respond to cellular and environmental cues. Moreover, the extraordinarily low degradation rate of OXPHOS complexes in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Price et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2012</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>) reinforces the idea that the dynamic association into supercomplexes adds an effective switch to control electron flows in response to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</xref>). The flexibility of energy metabolism is also critical for the adaptation of a number of prokaryotes to varying environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Unden et al., 2014</xref>). The utilization of modular OXPHOS chains confers flexibility depending on the available energy source or terminal electron acceptor but also allows modulation of the resulting <italic>pmf</italic>. So far, the adjustment of respiration to varying environments in prokaryotes is considered to be the result of an intricate transcriptional regulation network that controls the expression of OXPHOS complexes with varying electrogenic capacities.</p><p>At the same time, there is cumulative evidence for an elaborate spatial organization of macromolecules in bacterial cells. We thus hypothesized that the OXPHOS process could be regulated through the dynamic subcellular localization of complexes in response to the metabolic demand. Here, we investigate the native localization of a major OXPHOS complex under anoxic conditions, the quinol oxidizing nitrate reductase complex from the gut bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and its dynamics upon changes in the environment by real-time fluorescence imaging in live cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> nitrate reductase complex is composed of three subunits (NarGHI) and likely organized in a dimer under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertero et al., 2003</xref>). A di-heme <italic>b</italic>-type cytochrome subunit, NarI, ensures quinol oxidation and membrane anchoring of the cytoplasmically oriented catalytic dimer, NarGH, where nitrate reduction takes place. The C-terminus of the catalytic subunit NarG protruding from the quaternary structure of the complex was labeled with a green fluorescent protein (GFP). The hybrid gene was expressed under the control of its native promoter activated by FNR and NarL transcriptional factors in response to anaerobiosis and nitrate, respectively and ectopically integrated into the chromosome of the nitrate reductase-deficient strain JCB4023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Potter et al., 1999</xref>). The corresponding fusion was functional as verified by cell growth in nitrate-respiring conditions where a functional nitrate reductase complex is mandatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Fractionation studies confirmed the membrane localization of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The in vitro assay of the functional integrity of the NarG-gfpH catalytic module showed that the activity was only slightly affected by the fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

As a negative control, the nitrate reductase-deficient strain JCB4023 shows no growth under these conditions (■).

First, fluorescence imaging was performed on exponentially growing cells under oxygen-respiring conditions. Surprisingly, the fluorescence signal was evenly distributed along the cytoplasmic membrane under those conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As compared to nitrate-respiring cells, fewer clusters are present and evenly distributed in oxygen-respiring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). Second, anaerobic respiration on alternative substrates such as fumarate or trimethylamine <italic>N</italic>-oxide (TMAO) was tested. It induces a significant polar localization of the fluorescence signal albeit lower than under nitrate-respiring conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Fluorescence imaging was eventually analyzed on anoxic fermenting growing cells using glucose as sole carbon source. Strikingly, the fluorescence was evenly distributed as observed under oxygen-respiring conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Detailed analysis of the fluorescence signal distribution in all these metabolic conditions revealed that the formation of fluorescent clusters is systematically associated with polar localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the nitrate reductase complex displays a dynamic subcellular localization in response to the metabolic demand.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05357.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Metabolism-dependent localization of the nitrate reductase OXPHOS complex.</title><p>Mean frequency of LCB3635 cells displaying clusters at the cell poles for various metabolic conditions (anaerobic respiration with either nitrate, fumarate or TMAO as terminal electron acceptor, aerobic respiration and anoxic fermenting conditions).

The present finding imparts particular significance to the previous reports that <italic>pmf</italic> can play a role in protein localization in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcock et al., 2013</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rose et al., 2013</xref>). Saliently, the dissipation of the electric component of the <italic>pmf</italic>, the transmembrane potential (ΔΨ), hampers proper localization of proteins involved in cell division, chromosome segregation or cell shape regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Strahl and Hamoen, 2010</xref>). However there is, to our knowledge, no report of a protein localization that would be specifically controlled by the other component of the <italic>pmf</italic>, the proton concentration gradient (ΔpH). To evaluate the participation of the <italic>pmf</italic> in the subcellular localization of the GFP-labeled nitrate reductase and analyze the contribution of its two components, we first treated nitrate-respiring cells with distinct ionophores. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the addition of carbonyl cyanide <italic>m</italic>-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a specific proton-ionophore rapidly dissipating the <italic>pmf</italic>, resulted in a significant reduction of cells displaying polar clusters. Unexpectedly, depolarization of the membrane potential through the addition of the potassium-ionophore valinomycin had no effect, whereas dissipation of ΔpH by the electroneutral anion/OH<sup>−</sup>-exchanger trichlorocarbanilide (TCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Booth, 1983</xref>) gave rise to significant delocalization of the fluorescent signal. To substantiate the critical role of ΔpH for polar localization, we reasoned that artificial establishment of a proton concentration gradient by the light-driven proton translocation activity of the proteorhodopsin (PR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Walter et al., 2007</xref>) should be sufficient to promote the polar recruitment of the nitrate reductase complex under anoxic fermentative conditions. Indeed, under fermenting conditions, it is considered that the ΔpH is very low as compared to respiring conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, heterologous expression of PR resulted in polar localization of the fluorescence signal in nearly 40% of cells. Thus, we conclude that the proton concentration gradient is a critical cue for polar localization of this anaerobic OXPHOS complex. We next questioned the importance of nitrate reductase activity on its subcellular localization. To this end, a catalytically inactive but stable variant was used. In particular, the H50S substitution in NarG precludes insertion of two metal centers at the active site while x-ray structural analysis of the NarG<sub>H50S</sub>HI complex revealed the absence of structural changes at the protein surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalon et al., 1998</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rothery et al., 2010</xref>). Under nitrate-respiring conditions, the fluorescence signal associated with the H50S variant is uniformly distributed likely due to its inability to generate a ΔpH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, adding fumarate gives rise to a significant polar localization of the inactive GFP-labeled nitrate reductase complex reinforcing the conclusion that activity of the complex is essential for polar positioning unless a ΔpH is established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The above-described modification of the localization pattern of the nitrate reductase complex in response to metabolic changes begs the question of its timeframe. First, nitrate-respiring cells were submitted to strong aeration and the fluorescent pattern was followed during the course of the anoxic–oxic transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). While 80% of the bacterial cells initially displayed a pronounced polar localization of the GFP-labeled nitrate reductase complex, the signal started to change noticeably after 15 min, reaching an almost uniform distribution after one hour of aerobic transition. A similar temporal behavior has been observed under the reverse conditions using aerobically growing cells transferred to anoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In this case, more than 70% of the bacterial cells displayed a polar localization of the fluorescent signal after the transition. Thus, redistribution of the OXPHOS complex triggered by metabolic changes operates on timescales of several tens of minutes. While such timing may reflect the slow diffusion of such large membrane-embedded complexes in the crowded cytoplasmic membrane, we next questioned whether this switch is faster than the changes in nitrate reductase protein content as the result of transcriptional regulation. At first, western-blotting analyses showed nearly unchanged level of GFP-labeled nitrate reductase complex upon anoxic–oxic transition despite the rapid redistribution of the complex in the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In comparison, an increased level of complex is observed during the oxic–anoxic transition as the result of FNR-mediated regulation. To substantiate these observations, localization upshift experiments were reproduced in cells pre-treated with chloramphenicol (Cm), a protein synthesis inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). During the anoxic–oxic transition, Cm had nearly no impact on the delocalization kinetics with only slight diminution of the nitrate reductase content. Interestingly, during the oxic–anoxic transition, the fluorescence signal remains uniformly distributed with a concomitant decrease of nitrate reductase content. To rule out any impact on the yielded <italic>pmf</italic> value under those conditions, the oxic–anoxic upshift experiment was reproduced in presence of PR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, establishment of a ΔpH was not sufficient to promote polar localization. Altogether, these results support the idea that induction of the expression of at least one gene during the oxic–anoxic transition promotes polar localization of the nitrate reductase complex.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05357.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Metabolism-dependent localization changes occur in a timeframe of several tens of minutes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Black bars) Nitrate-respiring JCB4023/pVA70GFP cells were submitted to strong aeration and the fluorescence pattern was evaluated at 15-min intervals.

To evaluate the impact of polar localization on the electron flux from primary dehydrogenases to GFP-labeled nitrate reductase, it was essential to ensure an identical composition of the cytoplasmic membrane in terms of OXPHOS complexes. To account for this issue, we used fermenting-growing cells expressing or not PR which have an identical OXPHOS proteome but display distinct localization patterns of the GFP-labeled complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Upon addition of nitrate in the growth medium, electron flux through the nitrate reductase complex could be kinetically resolved by quantifying nitrite in the cell culture. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, within the first 10 min following nitrate addition, the rate of nitrite production is significantly higher in PR-expressing cells than in control cells, indicating a direct correlation between subcellular localization and electron flux through the nitrate reductase complex. After one hour, the level of nitrite produced is nearly two orders of magnitude higher in PR-expressing cells. We conclude that environmental conditions (anaerobiosis and a ΔpH) promoting polar clustering of the nitrate reductase complex result in a higher efficiency of the associated respiratory chains.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the past decade, the emerging field of bacterial cell biology has underscored the fact that dynamic subcellular localization is intimately linked to the biological function allowing control of fundamental processes, such as cell division, virulence, motility, or signal transduction (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kiekebusch and Thanbichler, 2014</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Laloux and Jacobs-Wagner, 2014</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nevo-Dinur et al., 2012</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shapiro et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, we have shown that the nitrate reductase respiratory complex is submitted to a spatiotemporal regulation in response to environmental conditions which, in turns, potentiates the electron flux through the associated respiratory chain. Nitrate respiration in <italic>E. coli</italic> is thus controlled by specific subcellular localization of its terminal reductase. Segregation of respiratory complexes within the cytoplasmic membrane has also been reported for components of bacterial aerobic chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Johnson et al., 2004</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lenn et al., 2008</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Werner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rexroth et al., 2011</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Llorente-Garcia et al., 2014</xref>). The actual view is that functional consequences are associated with a high level of structural organization of respiratory complexes within bioenergetic membranes (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Genova and Lenaz, 2014</xref>). Interestingly enough, recent studies have evidenced the existence of functional microdomains in bacterial membranes organizing a specific subset of proteins in space and time surmising a gain-of-function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lopez and Kolter, 2010</xref>). In the same line of thought, it has recently been shown that clustering of multiple enzymes belonging to the same metabolic pathway into agglomerates accelerates the processing of intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castellana et al., 2014</xref>). Clearly, several alternatives can be found for the reported enhanced electron flux in the nitrate reductase-associated respiratory chains such as physical association into supercomplexes or segregating respiratory complexes into microdomains. In both cases, one would hypothesize that the probability of the quinone molecules to encounter the nitrate reductase is higher. Evidences have been provided for such quinone channeling within supercomplexes while the exact mechanism of channeling is not yet understood (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Genova and Lenaz, 2014</xref>).</p><p>By providing the first evidence for a spatiotemporal regulation of a respiratory complex in response to environmental conditions, this work establishes a basis for a deeper analysis on how environmental signals are translated into subcellular localization of respiratory complexes to adjust the respiration output.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> strains and plasmids are described in Table1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were grown aerobically at 37°C in defined minimal medium supplemented with 140 mM of glycerol used as sole carbon source and 100 mM nitrate.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.

However, their search and identification is clearly outside the scope of our manuscript and will require the use of genetic screening for instance. While this is obviously one of the future directions of our work, we have decided not to consider such mutants in our revised version. Furthermore, we consider that their identification is not essential to support our conclusion.</p><p><italic>Blue-Native Gel Electrophoresis should be carried out to test the inference that super-assemblies of respiratory complexes (such as observed for mitochondria) are formed. The co-association of other components should also be tested in these assays as well as by fluorescence and immune-labeling microscopy</italic>.</p><p>The main conclusion of our work is that the nitrate reductase respiratory complex is submitted to a spatiotemporal regulation in response to environmental conditions which, in turns, potentiates the electron flux through the associated respiratory chain. Evaluating whether the nitrate reductase complex is engaged in a supramolecular organization as requested is again outside the scope of our work. Furthermore, this would constitute an entire work per se which would hardly facilitate reading of our submitted manuscript. Other alternatives to a supramolecular organization of the respiratory chain can also be considered for functional advantages such as segregation into microdomains as mentioned in the discussion section of our manuscript. Consequently, we have decided not to consider these experiments in our revised version.</p><p><italic>The claim that the changes in localization are quicker than would be expected if changes in gene expression were responsible [even though bacterial genes are induced within minutes of anaerobiosis (see Li et al. 1987 J.

The authors should also examine the localization of proteorhodopsin and confirm the localization of native or functional epitope tagged NarG by immunolocalization in these experiments. Finally, there needs to be a negative control to show that proteorhodopsin does not direct any GFP-tagged membrane protein into bi-polar clusters</italic>.</p><p>At first, the text has now been clarified as our concern was to question whether redistribution of the complex in the membrane occurs in a shorter timescale than changes in nitrate reductase content as the result of transcriptional regulation of the <italic>nar</italic> gene expression. There is no doubt that transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>nar</italic> gene expression occurs in a very rapid fashion (see for instance, Partridge et al. JBC 2006 and 2007), but how this is translated into changes in protein content considering the intricate structure of the complex of 500kDa with 8 metal centers was unclear. Additional data are now included in the revised manuscript as requested (see Results and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6CD</xref>). During anoxic-oxic transition, the redistribution of the complex is unaffected by chloramphenicol and occurs within several tens of minutes without significant changes in nitrate reductase content (as evaluated by western-blotting). These data support the conclusion that changes in subcellular localization can occur without changes in complex content. In contrast, during the oxic-anoxic transition, FNR-mediated up regulation of the <italic>nar</italic> gene expression precludes any conclusion. Interestingly, these new data indicate that protein synthesis is required for polar localization under these oxic-anoxic conditions.</p><p>Finally, we provided evidence for uniform distribution of the proteorhodopsin (PR) in the membrane using its red fluorescence emission (see subsection headed “Fluorescence microscopy”). The membrane localization of nitrate reductase was already ascertained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> by immunoblotting and by its ability to sustain growth under nitrate respiration where its functionality is mandatory. Finally, one of the reviewer concerns was to ascertain that PR expression does not direct any membrane protein into bi-polar clusters. We provide here direct evidence that this is not the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Indeed, PR expression during the oxic-anoxic transition in presence of Cm was not sufficient to promote polar localization.</p><p><italic>2) Appropriate statistical analysis of data needs to be included for all experiments</italic>.</p><p>We totally agree and in the revised version, statistical analyses of data have now been included for all experiments. Specifically, fluorescence image analyses were performed as follow. At least three independent experiments were performed and treated separately, calculating frequency of cells with polar clusters and displaying the data as mean frequency with error bars. As such, a total of nearly 1000 cells have been analyzed for each condition. When appropriate, the non-parametric Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney statistical analysis was included to compare data. The same procedure was used for western-blotting analyses. The data are represented as mean with error bars of the signal ratio between GFP-labelled nitrate reductase and IscS used as an internal control. Again, when appropriate, Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney statistical analyses are included to compare data.</p><p><italic>3) The Discussion needs to be expanded and address the question “How do the findings fit into the wider field of bacterial cell biology, metabolic channeling in bacteria and organelles?” (Werner et al. PNAS 2009) rather than speculate on host-pathogen interactions in the gut</italic>.</p><p>The Discussion section has now been completely rewritten in the context of cell biology.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) The new result with the inactive mutant that does not localize properly is based on a figure that shows two cells.
