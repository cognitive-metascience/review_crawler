How amino acids and other nutrients stimulate its activity via the Rag/Gtr GTPases remains poorly understood. We here report that the signal triggering Rag/Gtr-dependent TORC1 activation upon amino-acid uptake is the coupled H<sup>+</sup> influx catalyzed by amino-acid/H<sup>+</sup> symporters. H<sup>+</sup>-dependent uptake of other nutrients, ionophore-mediated H<sup>+</sup> diffusion, and inhibition of the vacuolar V-ATPase also activate TORC1. As the increase in cytosolic H<sup>+</sup> elicited by these processes stimulates the compensating H<sup>+</sup>-export activity of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (Pma1), we have examined whether this major ATP-consuming enzyme might be involved in TORC1 control. We find that when the endogenous Pma1 is replaced with a plant H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, H<sup>+</sup> influx or increase fails to activate TORC1. Our results show that H<sup>+</sup> influx coupled to nutrient uptake stimulates TORC1 activity and that Pma1 is a key actor in this mechanism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31981.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells adapt their growth rate depending on the amount of nutrients available. The protein complex called TORC1 plays a central role in this. When nutrients are abundant, TORC1 is very active and stimulates the production of proteins and other molecules needed for the cell to grow. However, when nutrients such as amino acids become scarce, TORC1 reduces its activity and allows the cells to adapt to starvation. This TORC1-mediated control of the metabolism is crucial for the cell to survive, and faulty TORC1 proteins have been associated with several diseases including cancers.</p><p>TORC1 was originally discovered in yeast, which provides a powerful model to study this control system. However, until now, it was not known how TORC1 is reactivated when amino acids are added to cells that have been starved of these molecules. Knowing the answer to this question would allow us to better understand how the availability of nutrients controls the activity of TORC1.</p><p>Now, Saliba et al. have discovered that TORC1 is not reactivated by the amino acids themselves, but by protons, which are positively charged hydrogen ions that travel into the cell together with the amino acids. This influx of protons is the driving force behind the active transport of amino acids and other nutrients into the cell, and potentially serves as a general signal to activate TORC1 in response to the uptake of nutrients, especially when cells have been starved.</p><p>Furthermore, the results showed that a specific enzyme in the cell membrane plays an essential role in activating TORC1. This enzyme pumps the protons out of the cell to compensate for their influx and to maintain the proton gradient in the membrane that drives the absorption of nutrients. When this enzyme was replaced with an equivalent plant enzyme, the proton-coupled nutrient uptake did not activate TORC1 in the yeast cells.</p><p>These findings may help scientists who are interested in how TORC1 is regulated in organisms other than mammals, such as plants or fungi. A next step will be to find out how exactly the proton pump in the cell membrane helps to activate TORC1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nutrient signaling</kwd><kwd>TORC1</kwd><kwd>H+-ATPase</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds National de La Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3.4.592.08.F</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>André</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds pour la Formation à la Recherche dans l'Industrie et dans l'Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21074048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saliba</surname><given-names>Elie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds National de La Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22396499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gournas</surname><given-names>Christos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds National de La Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>30274494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evangelinos</surname><given-names>Minoas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The H+ influx coupled to nutrient uptake and the plasma membrane H+-ATPase are central actors of the activation of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) in budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) plays a pivotal role in controlling cell growth in probably all eukaryotic organisms. It operates by integrating upstream signals such as growth factors (GFs) and nutrients to modulate, by phosphorylation, multiple downstream effectors, mostly proteins involved in anabolic processes (e.g. protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis) or catabolic processes (e.g. autophagy, bulk endocytosis of plasma membrane transporters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">González and Hall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Powis and De Virgilio, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). The central role of TORC1 in regulating cell growth is illustrated by the many reported cases of mTORC1 dysfunction associated with diseases including cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eltschinger and Loewith, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In human cells, GFs and amino acids are key signals of mTORC1 regulation. GFs act through activation of Rheb, a GTPase present at the lysosomal membrane that stimulates mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durán and Hall, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>). Amino acids such as leucine and arginine act via a complex of two GTPases, namely RagA or B and RagC or D, to promote recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosome, where it is activated by Rheb. The heterodimeric Rag GTPase complex recruits mTORC1 to the lysosome when RagA/B is bound to GTP and RagC/D to GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>). The activity of GTPases is typically modulated by GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs) and Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs). Recent studies have aimed to identify these GAPs and GEFs and their upstream regulators and to better understand how these factors are controlled in response to variations in the cytosolic concentrations of amino acids and/or to their transport across the plasma or lysosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">González and Hall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Powis and De Virgilio, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Importantly, Sestrin and Castor proteins have recently been found to act, respectively, as cytosolic leucine and arginine sensors. When bound to their specific amino acids, these sensor proteins lose the ability to inhibit GATOR2, a negative modulator of the GATOR1 GAP complex which inhibits RagA/B, and this results in TORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wolfson and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Specific lysosomal amino acid transporters and the V-ATPase complex also contribute importantly to mTORC1 control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goberdhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>). All this illustrates the complexity of the mechanisms through which amino acids regulate mTORC1 activity.</p><p>The TOR kinase that is part of TORC1 was originally identified in yeast, after isolation of dominant <italic>TOR</italic> mutations conferring resistance to rapamycin (Rap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heitman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>). The protein components of TORC1, the RagA/B and C/D proteins, and their upstream GATOR-type regulatory complexes also exist in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hatakeyama and De Virgilio, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>). For instance, RagA/B and RagC/D correspond, respectively, to the yeast Gtr1 and Gtr2 proteins, which are part of a vacuole-associated complex (EGO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubouloz et al., 2005</xref>) similar to the Rag-binding Ragulator of human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>). When cells are grown in nutrient-rich medium, yeast TORC1 is active and stimulates by phosphorylation a wide variety of proteins. It notably stimulates the Sch9 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Urban et al., 2007</xref>) under conditions promoting anabolic functions and cell growth. Active TORC1 also inhibits the Tap42-PP2A phosphatase, which stimulates autophagy, stress resistance, and nitrogen (N) transport and utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>). In contrast, TORC1 is inhibited in N-starved and Rap-treated cells, so that anabolic processes, including protein synthesis, are inhibited and cell responses such as autophagy, bulk endocytosis of transporters, utilization of secondary N sources, and stress resistance are stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hatakeyama and De Virgilio, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>). One Tap42-PP2A target protein is the protein kinase Npr1 (Nitrogen permease reactivator 1), which is phospho-inhibited when TORC1 is active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmidt et al., 1998</xref>). Once Npr1 is inhibited, various permeases of nitrogenous compounds undergo intrinsic inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boeckstaens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boeckstaens et al., 2015</xref>) or downregulation via ubiquitylation, endocytosis, and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MacGurn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merhi and AndreAndré, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Stimulation of TORC1 activity in yeast is usually monitored by visualizing the degree of Sch9 and/or Npr1 kinase phosphorylation. Sch9 and Npr1 are moderately phosphorylated in cells grown on a poor N source such as proline, but hyperphosphorylated upon addition of a preferential N source such as glutamine (Gln) or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmidt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stracka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Urban et al., 2007</xref>). In a study using Sch9 phosphorylation as readout, addition of any amino acid to proline-grown cells was found to result in rapid but transient Rag/Gtr-dependent TORC1 activation, whereas longer term TORC1 activation was observed only upon addition of an N source supporting optimal growth, for example Gln or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and it appeared not to depend on the Rag GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stracka et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, sustained activation of TORC1 in response to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is impaired in mutant cells lacking the glutamate dehydrogenases involved in assimilation of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> into amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fayyad-Kazan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merhi and AndreAndré, 2012</xref>). The upstream signals and molecular mechanisms involved in activation of yeast TORC1 in response to amino acid uptake and/or assimilation remain poorly known. For instance, although Gln behaves as a key signal for sustained TORC1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crespo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stracka et al., 2014</xref>), no Gln sensor has been identified to date, and yeast seems to lack Sestrin and Castor proteins. Furthermore, no study has evidenced any particular role of vacuolar amino acid transporters in TORC1 regulation. The yeast leucyl-tRNA synthetase is reported to play a role in sensing balanced levels of isoleucine, leucine, and valine and to act as a GEF for Gtr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonfils et al., 2012</xref>), whereas the equivalent mammalian enzyme is proposed to control mTORC1 as a GAP for RagD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Han et al., 2012</xref>). On the basis of current knowledge, it would thus seem that the upstream signals and mechanisms controlling TORC1 according to the N or amino acid supply conditions might differ significantly between yeast and human cells.</p><p>The present study began with an unexpected observation regarding the uptake of β-alanine into yeast cells: this amino acid, which cannot be used as an N source (i.e. it is not a source of amino acids), stimulates TORC1 activity. Analysis of this effect has revealed that the general signal triggering Rag/Gtr-dependent activation of TORC1 in response to amino acid uptake is the influx of H<sup>+</sup> coupled to transport via H<sup>+</sup>/amino-acid symporters. We further show that the Pma1 H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase establishing the H<sup>+</sup> gradient at the plasma membrane is essential to this TORC1 activation, and suggest that Pma1 modulates TORC1 via signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Uptake of β-alanine via the Gap1 permease causes Rag/Gtr-dependent TORC1 activation without increasing internal pools of amino acids</title><p>In cells growing under poor N supply conditions (e.g. in a medium containing proline as sole N source), the yeast general amino acid permease Gap1 is active and stable at the plasma membrane. Under these conditions, TORC1 is only moderately active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmidt et al., 1998</xref>). Activation of TORC1 upon NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake and assimilation into amino acids triggers Gap1 ubiquitylation, followed by its endocytosis and degradation in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merhi and AndreAndré, 2012</xref>). Thanks to isolation of a Gap1 mutant insensitive to this TORC1-dependent ubiquitylation, we have shown that substrate transport by Gap1 can also trigger Ub-dependent endocytosis and degradation of this transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghaddar et al., 2014b</xref>). This type of control, shared with other transporters of fungal and non-fungal species, probably enables cells to avoid excess uptake of external compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gournas et al., 2016</xref>). To further investigate, without interference from the TORC1-dependent pathway, the mechanism of transport-elicited Gap1 ubiquitylation we sought to identify a Gap1 amino acid substrate unable to activate TORC1. We focused on beta-alanine (β-ala) and confirmed its reported status as a Gap1 substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stolz and Sauer, 1999</xref>) by comparing the uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]-β-ala (0.5 mM) in proline-grown wild-type and <italic>gap1∆</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). β-Ala, however, cannot sustain growth when used as sole N source, that is it cannot serve as a source of amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This contrasts with 4-aminobutyrate (GABA), an amino acid differing from β-ala by a single additional CH<sub>2</sub> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and whose catabolism depends on a specific GABA transaminase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2007</xref>). We thus tested whether β-ala transport by Gap1 triggers ubiquitylation and downregulation of the transporter. This proved to be the case, as addition of β-ala (0.5 mM) caused the appearance, above the immunodetected Gap1 signal, of two slowly migrating bands that were not observed with the non-ubiquitylable Gap1(K9R,K16R) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Upon β-ala addition, furthermore, Gap1 initially present at the cell surface underwent endocytosis and targeting to the vacuole, whereas Gap1(K9R,K16R) remained stable at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). An inactive Gap1 mutant (Gap1-126) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghaddar et al., 2014b</xref>) failed to be ubiquitylated and downregulated upon β-ala addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). These results are those expected if β-ala elicits Gap1 ubiquitylation specifically via the transport-elicited pathway. Yet we sought to make sure that β-ala does not activate TORC1. To our surprise, addition of β-ala to proline-grown cells caused a typical manifestation of TORC1 activation: a Rap-sensitive reduction of the electrophoretic mobility of HA-tagged Npr1, indicative of increased phosphorylation via TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merhi and AndreAndré, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmidt et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). β-Ala similarly caused a Rap-sensitive increase in the phosphorylation of Sch9 kinase residue Thr737 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), a known TORC1 target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Urban et al., 2007</xref>). It thus seemed that activation of TORC1, largely impaired in the <italic>gap1∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), could contribute to the observed β-ala-induced downregulation of Gap1. This assumption was confirmed in additional experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Gap1-mediated uptake of β-ala thus results in TORC1 activation. We therefore hypothesized that, although β-ala cannot be used as an N source, it might be converted to certain amino acids capable of stimulating TORC1. β-Ala uptake, however, was found not to increase the intracellular concentrations of individual amino acids, measured in cell extracts, apart from that of β-ala itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We next tested whether this β-ala-induced activation of TORC1 involves the Rag A/B and C/D GTPases, encoded by the <italic>GTR1</italic> and <italic>GTR2</italic> genes, respectively. Increased phosphorylation of Npr1 upon β-ala addition was indeed impaired in <italic>gtr1∆ gtr2∆</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and this effect was not due to reduced uptake of β-ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We conclude that Gap1-mediated uptake of β-ala elicits TORC1 activation via the Rag GTPases, and that this effect is not due to conversion of intracellular β-ala to other amino acids.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31981.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Uptake of β-alanine via the Gap1 permease causes Rag/Gtr-dependent TORC1 activation without increasing the internal pools of amino acids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top. Wild-type (w–t) and <italic>gap1Δ</italic> cells were grown on Gluc Pro medium and [<sup>14</sup>C]-β-ala (0.5 mM) was added to the medium before measurement of the incorporated radioactivity at various times.

According to this model, conformational changes of Gap1, triggered by binding and/or transport of amino acids, would stimulate a PKA-targeting signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schothorst et al., 2013</xref>). We thus hypothesized that this transceptor function of Gap1 might also promote TORC1 activation in a Rag/Gtr-dependent manner. This hypothesis is potentially supported by a previous report that Gap1 interacts with Gtr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao and Kaiser, 2006</xref>). An alternative view is that β-ala entering cells through Gap1 might be detected by a cytosolic amino acid sensor capable of promoting TORC1 activation. To explore these possibilities, we tested whether β-ala uptake via another permease might also activate TORC1. Confirming a previous prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gournas et al., 2015</xref>), we found the high-affinity proline permease Put4 also to catalyze β-ala transport. This contribution of Put4 was visible at least in proline-free media, such as a medium where the sole N source was urea (another poor N source). Under these conditions, the <italic>gap1∆</italic> mutant displayed residual uptake of β-ala (2 mM), and this uptake was abolished in the <italic>gap1∆ put4∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, this Put4-dependent β-ala uptake was associated with a Rap-sensitive hyperphosphorylation of Npr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

HcGap1 shares ~ 30% sequence identity with Gap1 and Put4. In proline-grown <italic>gap1∆</italic> cells, HcGap1 restored high β-ala uptake activity, roughly similar to that conferred by Put4 to urea-grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Remarkably, this uptake of β-ala was also associated with Rap-sensitive hyperphosphorylation of Npr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In conclusion, transport of β-ala via endogenous Gap1 and/or Put4 or via the heterologous HcGap1 permease elicits TORC1 activation. Although these observations do not rule out the possibility that all three tested permeases might function as transceptors, they seem to favor the view that intracellular β-ala itself, or the process of its transport across the plasma membrane, stimulates TORC1 activity.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31981.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Uptake of β-ala via the endogenous Put4 or the heterologous HcGap1 permease also promotes TORC1 activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) w-t, <italic>gap1Δ</italic>, and <italic>gap1Δ put4Δ</italic> cells were grown on Gluc urea medium. [<sup>14</sup>C]-β-ala (0.1 or 2 mM) was added to the medium before measuring the incorporated radioactivity at various times.

These sensors could, for instance, act like the human Castor and Sestrin proteins, recently shown to function as arginine and leucine sensors, respectively, and to modulate upstream regulators of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wolfson and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). These sensor proteins, however, do not seem to exist in yeast. Furthermore, one would not expect a cytosolic sensor capable of activating TORC1 in response to β-ala. Alternatively, a TORC1-activating signal might arise from a common feature of the permease-mediated Arg and β-ala transport reactions. In yeast, transport by secondary active plasma membrane transporters is coupled to H<sup>+</sup> influx. This transport is thus driven by the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup> gradient established by the Pma1 H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. We therefore hypothesized that an influx of H<sup>+</sup> coupled to amino acid uptake might initiate a signal stimulating TORC1 activity. To evaluate this hypothesis, we first checked that the β-ala and Arg transporters tested above are H<sup>+</sup>-symporters. In support of this view, incubation of cells with the FCCP protonophore caused a strong reduction of β-ala uptake via Gap1, Put4, or HcGap1 and of Arg uptake via Gap1, Can1, or HcGap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Furthermore, each permease was rapidly inhibited when the cells were shifted to glucose-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), a condition known to cause rapid inhibition of the Pma1 H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and thus collapse of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup> gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kane, 2016</xref>). Hence, as expected, all four permeases analyzed in our study, including HcGap1, behave as H<sup>+</sup>-symporters. We next examined whether active uptake of another metabolite, not present in the growth medium, also elicits Rag/Gtr-dependent TORC1 activation. We chose cytosine, whose uptake via the Fcy2 permease is known to be coupled to H<sup>+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pinson et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, addition of cytosine did cause rapid activation of TORC1, as judged by increased Npr1 and Sch9 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Furthermore, this cytosine-elicited TORC1 activation was largely impaired in the <italic>gtr1∆ gtr2∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Cytosine can be used as sole N source, and thus as a source of amino acids. Yet in an <italic>fcy1</italic> mutant lacking cytosine deaminase and thus unable to use cytosine as an N source, Npr1 was still phosphorylated upon cytosine addition, unless Rap was also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). H<sup>+</sup>-coupled uptake of cytosine thus stimulates TORC1 in a Rag/Gtr-dependent manner, even when the nucleobase is not assimilated into amino acids. This observation is compatible with the proposed view that H<sup>+</sup> influx is the signal initiating TORC1 stimulation.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31981.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>H<sup>+</sup>influx coupled to transport promotes Rag/Gtr-dependent stimulation of TORC1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The β-ala uptake activities of Gap1 (in w-t cells grown on Gluc Pro medium), Put4 (in <italic>gap1Δ</italic> cells grown on Gluc urea medium), and HcGap1 (in <italic>gap1Δ</italic> cells expressing HcGap1 and grown on Gluc Pro medium), were determined by measuring the initial rate of [<sup>14</sup>C]-β-ala incorporation (0.5 mM for Gap1, 2 mM for Put4 and HcGap1) before and after glucose starvation for 5 min or with or without prior incubation with FCCP (20 µM) or its solvent (0.2% EtOH) for 5 min.

Yet this TORC1 activation, intriguingly, did not lead to increased phosphorylation of Sch9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). A likely explanation is that an additional control elicited when the cytosol becomes too acidic (a stressful condition) impedes phosphorylation of Sch9 by activated TORC1.

The multisubunit SEACIT complex antagonizes TORC1 by acting as a GAP on the Gtr1 GTPase, and its function is itself negatively controlled by the multisubunit SEACAT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Panchaud et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2013b</xref>). To determine whether these GATOR-like upstream regulators of Gtr1 are involved in H<sup>+</sup> influx-elicited TORC1 activation, FCCP was added to cells lacking Seh1, a component of the SEACAT complex, or Iml1, a component of the SEACIT complexe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Panchaud et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2013b</xref>). TORC1 activation was largely impaired in the <italic>seh1∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In the <italic>iml1∆</italic> mutant, a high basal phosphorylation of HA-Npr1 was detected, as expected, and FCCP did not significantly further increase this phosphorylation, at least during the first minutes after its addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results indicate that the SEACIT/SEACAT upstream regulators of Gtr1 are involved in H<sup>+</sup>-influx-elicited stimulation of TORC1 activity. We also found the amount of HA-Npr1 to be much reduced in <italic>seh1∆</italic> mutant cells, and a similar effect though less pronounced was observed in the <italic>gtr1∆ gtr2∆</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>). This suggests that the abundance of HA-Npr1 is influenced by the activation state of TORC1. Furthermore, phosphorylation of HA-Npr1 in the above-analyzed mutants was found to increase after prolonged incubation with FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E and F</xref>). It thus seems that FCCP stimulates another mechanism of TORC1 activation that does not depend on the Rag/Gtr GTPases. For instance, prolonged incubation with FCCP might promote release of amino acids from the vacuole or mitochondria, and this could promote TORC1 activation independently of Gtr1/2. It has in fact been reported that the vacuole-associated Pib2 protein containing a FYVE domain acts in parallel with Gtr1 to promote TORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim and Cunningham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Varlakhanova et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, in an in vitro TORC1 kinase assay using isolated vacuoles, the addition of glutamine was found to stimulate TORC1 activity in a manner dependent on Pib2 but not Gtr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanigawa and Maeda, 2017</xref>). We thus also analyzed the role of Pib2 and found that HA-Npr1 is normally hyperphosphorylated after FCCP addition to <italic>pib2∆</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the above experiments indicate that H<sup>+</sup> influx mediated even by a protonophore elicits a cellular response resulting in Rag/Gtr-dependent, Pib2-independent, TORC1 activation. They further suggest that if the cytosol becomes too acidic, an additional control likely impedes Sch9 phosphorylation by activated TORC1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Inhibition of the vacuolar V-ATPase activates TORC1</title><p>We observed that addition of amino acids, cytosine, or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to growing cells does not detectably change their cytosolic pH (data not shown). This was expected, given the high buffering capacity of the cytosol and the compensating H<sup>+</sup> efflux activity of the Pma1 H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which is stimulated under acidic conditions as long as glucose is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eraso and Gancedo, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ullah et al., 2012</xref>). We then examined whether an increase of cytosolic H<sup>+</sup>, imposed without changing the composition of the external medium, might also lead to TORC1 activation. An H<sup>+</sup> increase can in principle be caused by inhibition of the vacuolar V-ATPase, as this enzymatic complex catalyzes ATP-dependent uptake of H<sup>+</sup> into the vacuole in order to acidify the organelle, to compensate for the constant H<sup>+</sup> efflux mediated by H<sup>+</sup>-coupled vacuolar transporters, and to control the cytosolic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kane, 2016</xref>). We thus tested the effects of two inhibitors of the V-ATPase, concanamycin A (CMA) and bafilomycin A (BAF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Addition of CMA to proline-grown cells did not significantly change the cytosolic pH of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This suggests that Pma1-dependent efflux and the buffering capacity of the cytosol prevented the expected increase in cytosolic H<sup>+</sup>. BAF addition did cause a slight but significant drop in the cytosolic pH, suggesting that this treatment caused stronger inhibition of the V-ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Remarkably, both CMA and BAF treatment resulted in stimulation of TORC1 activity, as judged by Rap-sensitive hyperphosphorylation of Npr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, respectively) and by a transient increase in Sch9 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, respectively). No increase in Npr1 phosphorylation was detected in either CMA- or BAF-treated <italic>gtr1∆ gtr2∆</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and H</xref>, respectively).

Alternatively, the Pma1 H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase might control TORC1 activity upon sensing H<sup>+</sup> influx or increase in cytosol. For instance, Pma1 activity increases under acidic conditions, and this coincides with a reduction of its Km for ATP, possibly via allosteric control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eraso and Gancedo, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ullah et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesized that the particular state adopted by the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in response to increased H<sup>+</sup> might stimulate certain factors controlling TORC1 activity. To test this possibility, we thought of expressing in yeast, instead of the endogenous Pma1, a heterologous H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase known to be catalytically active in yeast. We reasoned that if TORC1 activation depends on a signaling capability of Pma1, an H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase from a distant species should fail to activate TORC1 in response to an increase in cytosolic H<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>According to previous reports, several plant H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases are active when expressed in yeast strains where the essential <italic>PMA1</italic> gene and its non-essential paralog <italic>PMA2</italic> (expressed to a much lower level) are deleted or repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morsomme et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palmgren and Christensen, 1994</xref>). The wild-type forms of these plant H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases typically compensate only partially for the lack of Pma1. It is possible, however, to isolate mutant derivatives sustaining faster growth, particularly on low-pH media where cells need high H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity to maintain a neutral cytosolic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morsomme et al., 2000</xref>). For instance, the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Pma4 of tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana plumbaginifolia</italic>) restores limited growth to a <italic>pma1∆ pma2∆</italic> double<italic>-</italic>null mutant. A truncated Pma4 protein called Pma4<sup>882ochre</sup>, lacking the last 71 C-terminal amino acids as a result of an ochre nonsense mutation in codon 882 of the <italic>PMA4</italic> gene, is able to support faster growth of yeast <italic>pma1∆ pma2∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 1999</xref>). We thus studied TORC1 activation in cells expressing either the endogenous <italic>PMA1</italic> gene or the tobacco plant <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic> gene. As most the above experiments were carried out with strains having the ∑1278b background, we first isolated a <italic>GAL1-PMA1 pma2∆</italic> derivative of this strain, where the <italic>PMA1</italic> gene is placed under the control of the galactose-inducible, glucose-repressible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. This strain can grow on galactose but not glucose, unless it contains a plasmid expressing the endogenous <italic>PMA1</italic> gene or the tobacco <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic> gene under the control of the <italic>PMA1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We cultured <italic>GAL-PMA1 pma2∆</italic> cells expressing <italic>PMA1</italic> or <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic> on glucose proline medium, as in the above-described experiments. We found cells expressing <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic> to grow more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This shows that the mutant plant H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase does not fully compensate for the lack of Pma1. Accordingly, compared to the cytosolic pH of <italic>PMA1</italic>-expressing cells, that of <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells was slightly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). H<sup>+</sup>-coupled uptake of β-ala (1 mM) was also significantly lower in the latter cells (data not shown). We therefore lowered the concentration of β-ala provided to <italic>PMA1</italic>-expressing cells in order to reach an uptake rate equivalent to that measured in <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and F</xref>). As expected, and whichever gene was expressed, [<sup>14</sup>C]-β-ala uptake was inhibited after a brief treatment of the cells with FCCP. This shows that in both cases, β-ala uptake is coupled to H<sup>+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and F</xref>). Upon transfer of the cells to a glucose-free medium, uptake of β-ala into <italic>PMA1</italic>-expressing cells was also strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and F</xref>). This was expected, since Pma1 is inhibited under these conditions. This reduction was much less pronounced in <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and F</xref>). This result can be readily explained by the fact that inactivation of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases upon glucose starvation, a regulation conserved between yeast and plant H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, requires a C-terminal auto-inhibitory region which the truncated protein Pma4<sup>822ochre</sup> lacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morsomme et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Portillo, 2000</xref>). Next, under conditions of equal H<sup>+</sup>-coupled β-ala uptake into <italic>PMA1</italic>- and <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells, we analyzed TORC1 activity. Phosphorylation of Npr1 was found to increase moderately upon addition of β-ala at low concentration (0.1 mM) to <italic>PMA1</italic>-expressing cells, but this variation was significant, as judged by its sensitivity to Rap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Remarkably, no increase in Npr1 phosphorylation was detected in <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Furthermore, basal phosphorylation of Npr1 in these cells did not increase, despite the lower pH of their cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and C</xref>). Non-activation of TORC1 in <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells was even clearer when Sch9 phosphorylation was used as readout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Basal phosphorylation of Sch9 before β-ala addition was also reduced in <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Non-activation of TORC1 in <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells upon β-ala uptake was also observed in the background of another strain deleted of both <italic>PMA1</italic> and <italic>PMA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next analyzed TORC1 activation after addition of glutamine, leucine, or arginine, each activation being deficient in the <italic>gtr1Δ gtr2Δ</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). As with β-ala, the external concentration of each amino acid was first adjusted to reach equivalent uptake in <italic>PMA1</italic>- and <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells. Using these conditions, we observed a Rap-sensitive activation of TORC1 in the cells expressing <italic>PMA1</italic> but not in those expressing <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also analyzed TORC1 activation upon FCCP addition. In both <italic>PMA1</italic>- and <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells, as expected, the ionophore caused a rapid drop in the cytosolic pH, to a value close to the pH of the buffered external medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Also as expected, this induced strong hyperphosphorylation of Npr1 in control <italic>PMA1</italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). In contrast, FCCP addition did not increase Npr1 phosphorylation in <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Similar results were obtained after treatment with BAF: Npr1 phosphorylation was found to increase in <italic>PMA1</italic>-expressing but not in <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). These results show that the endogenous Pma1 H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase plays an essential role in Rag/Gtr-dependent TORC1 activation in response to increased cytosolic H<sup>+</sup>. The importance of Pma1 in stimulating TORC1 activity was also illustrated by the ability of <italic>PMA1</italic>-expressing cells to resume growth following exposure to Rap, whereas <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup>-</italic>expressing cells failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31981.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>TORC1 activation in response to increased cytosolic H<sup>+</sup>involves the Pma1 H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>GAL1p-PMA1 pma2Δ</italic> cells transformed with the YCp(Sc)PMA1, YEp(Np)PMA4<sup>882Ochre</sup>, or pFL36 (empty) plasmid (-) were grown for 3 days on solid medium with Pro as sole N source and Gal or Gluc as carbon source.

Interestingly, upon NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> addition to proline-grown cells, we found TORC1 to be properly activated by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> regardless of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase produced (Pma1 or the plant Pma4<sup>822ochre</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). This result shows that TORC1 can be properly activated in <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells. It also suggests that Pma1 is required for TORC1 activation in response to H<sup>+</sup> influx but not to an increase in internal amino acids.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Uptake of amino acids into N-deprived yeast cells causes Rag/Gtr-dependent activation of TORC1. The actual signal and the underlying mechanism of this cellular response remain unknown. Our study shows that what triggers this activation is the H<sup>+</sup> influx coupled to transport by H<sup>+</sup>/amino-acid symporters. A similar response is observed upon H<sup>+</sup>-dependent uptake of cytosine, or even fructose, but not when an equivalent amount of fructose enters the cells via passive transport systems. The activation of TORC1 can even be elicited by diffusion of extracellular H<sup>+</sup> via a protonophore or by inactivation of the vacuolar V-ATPase (which also causes an increase in cytosolic H<sup>+</sup>). We further show that TORC1 activation in response to an H<sup>+</sup> influx and/or an increase in cytosolic H<sup>+</sup> requires the Rag GTPases encoded by the <italic>GTR</italic> genes. It does not, however, require the Pib2 protein recently shown to act in parallel with the Rag/Gtr proteins to activate TORC1. Finally, we show that the Pma1 H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase plays a central role in this TORC1 activation pathway.</p><p>Yeast cells typically adapt to starvation for any nutrient by reducing TORC1 activity. This is probably because mechanisms capable of sensing the nutritional status of the cell impede the activation of TORC1, and not just because of a possible drop in H<sup>+</sup>-coupled uptake of this nutrient. This reduction of TORC1 activity typically coincides with increased synthesis of large amounts of high-affinity H<sup>+</sup>-symporters able to assimilate replenishing compounds, for example, Gap1 for amino acids, Pho84 for phosphate, Sul1 and Sul2 for sulfate, Zrt1 for zinc, Fcy2 for cytosine, and Fur4 for uracil. Furthermore, many permeases for the non-limiting nutrients likely undergo parallel increased endocytosis and degradation, as such responses have been observed in rapamycin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crapeau et al., 2014</xref>). This permease reconfiguration at the plasma membrane probably causes an overall reduction of the H<sup>+</sup> influx. Our results suggest that the H<sup>+</sup>-symporters that are derepressed under starvation conditions are potentially able to reactivate TORC1 once their substrate becomes available again in the medium. In other words, H<sup>+</sup> influx via these transporters could provide a general signal for reactivating TORC1 upon relief from diverse starvation conditions. On the other hand, sustained activation of TORC1 probably requires efficient assimilation of the internalized nutrient. Accordingly, longer term TORC1 activation after addition of a preferential N source such as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is reported to require glutamine accumulation and/or synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stracka et al., 2014</xref>). The influx of H<sup>+</sup> coupled to uptake of any growth-limiting nutrient might thus provide a general signal for rapid, transient TORC1 reactivation in order to prepare cells for subsequent growth acceleration or restart once the nutrient has been properly assimilated. It could also contribute to the reactivation of TORC1 observed upon addition of glucose to glucose-starved cells, as although glucose enters cells via Hxt facilitators it also reactivates Pma1, which in turn drives the H<sup>+</sup>-coupled uptake of amino acids and other nutrients.</p><p>Uptake of amino acids by N-starved cells is also reported to elicit transient activation of PKA, resulting in stimulation of trehalase by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donaton et al., 2003</xref>). According to current models, PKA could be activated via a signaling pathway stimulated by Gap1 acting as a transceptor, and a similar function has been described for other H<sup>+</sup>-coupled nutrient transporters found to be derepressed under particular starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schothorst et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, the mechanisms underlying this signaling remain unknown. It is tempting to envisage an alternative model according to which the signal eliciting PKA activation is the H<sup>+</sup> influx coupled to the nutrient uptake reaction, as in the case of TORC1. This model is worth considering, since addition of FCCP to N-starved cells results in stimulation of trehalase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study, addition of excess Gln to proline-grown cells was found to cause a rapid, transient activation of TORC1, not observed in the <italic>gtr1∆</italic> mutant, followed by a more sustained TORC1 activity, still observed in <italic>gtr1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stracka et al., 2014</xref>). This Gtr1-independent TORC1 activation is reminiscent of the situation described in mouse cells, where Gln activates mTORC1 in a manner independent of RagA and RagB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jewell et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, direct addition of Gln to isolated vacuoles elicits TORC1 activation in vitro in a Gtr1-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanigawa and Maeda, 2017</xref>). In contrast, this response requires the Pib2 protein proposed to act in parallel with Gtr1 to activate TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim and Cunningham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Varlakhanova et al., 2017</xref>). These observations suggest that Gln uptake first elicits a transient, Gtr1-dependent activation of TORC1, and we propose that the signal of this early activation is the H<sup>+</sup> influx coupled to Gln transport. The subsequent sustained activation of TORC1, in contrast, is suggested to be promoted by the intracellular accumulation of Gln (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stracka et al., 2014</xref>). The actual function of Pib2 in this process needs further investigation. The same applies to Gtr1/2 because, while sustained TORC1 activation occurs normally after Gln addition to <italic>gtr1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stracka et al., 2014</xref>), we failed to observe it in the double <italic>gtr1∆ gtr2∆</italic> mutant, in keeping with another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Varlakhanova et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We have found the Sch9 kinase to be stimulated by TORC1 in response to an increase in cytosolic H<sup>+</sup>. This observation is interesting, in the light of the recent finding that Sch9 contributes to pH homeostasis by controlling the assembly and activity of the vacuolar V-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilms et al., 2017</xref>). This is relevant because the latter, together with the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, contributes importantly to controlling the cytosolic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kane, 2016</xref>). Yet according to other reports, Sch9 phosphorylation and cell growth are reduced when the cytosol becomes acidic (e.g. after a drop to a pH near 6), for instance under glucose starvation or when Pma1 synthesis is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dechant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orij et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ullah et al., 2012</xref>). It thus seems that even though Sch9 is activated by an H<sup>+</sup> influx and/or by an increase in cytosolic H<sup>+</sup>, it is inhibited when the cytosol becomes too acidic, and this causes growth inhibition. In FCCP-treated cells, accordingly, TORC1 appears to be efficiently activated (as judged by hyperphosphorylation of the Npr1 kinase), but this is not accompanied by Sch9 phosphorylation. This suggests that a particular mechanism sensitive to acidic conditions hampers Sch9 phosphorylation by activated TORC1. Such a control seems physiologically relevant, as acidification of the cytosol is stressful for the cell and stimulation of growth under these conditions would be inappropriate. Accordingly, other stresses are reported to promote dephosphorylation of Sch9 without affecting the TORC1-regulated Tap42-PP2A branch controlling Npr1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hughes Hallett et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A key question raised by our work is: what is the molecular mechanism responsible for stimulation of TORC1 activity in response to H<sup>+</sup> influx and/or an increase in cytosolic H<sup>+</sup>? Our data indicate that the plasma membrane Pma1 H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase plays a central role in this cellular response. Specifically, TORC1 activity fails to be stimulated in response to H<sup>+</sup>-coupled uptake of amino acids, ionophore-mediated H<sup>+</sup> diffusion, or inhibition of the V-ATPase in cells producing the tobacco plant Pma4<sup>822ochre</sup> instead of Pma1. Furthermore, these cells display a strongly reduced ability to restart growth after exposure to rapamycin. At least two models can be proposed to account for these observations. On the one hand, non-activation of TORC1 might result indirectly from the inability of Pma4<sup>822ochre</sup> to fully compensate for the lack of Pma1 activity. We did find <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic> -expressing cells to grow more slowly and their cytosol to be slightly acidic. This might trigger adaptive feedback mechanisms impeding TORC1 reactivation. Yet in <italic>PMA4<sup>822ochre</sup></italic>-expressing cells we found TORC1 to be properly activated after NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> addition, and this shows that TORC1 activity can be efficiently stimulated at least via the Rag/Gtr-independent pathway seemingly responding to internal amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stracka et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, the essential role of Pma1 in TORC1 activation in response to H<sup>+</sup> influx might reflect the ability of Pma1 to stimulate a signaling pathway controlling TORC1 activity. For instance, the activity of Pma1 is known to increase when the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> in the cytosol rises, and this control involves a decreased Km for ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eraso and Gancedo, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ullah et al., 2012</xref>). This activity increase also likely occurs when protons are co-transported with nutrients via plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-symporters. This stimulation of Pma1 activity, possibly involving a conformational change of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, might be transmitted to cytosolic factors that would in turn modulate TORC1 activity. A role of Pma1 in signaling to TORC1 is attractive, because Pma1 is the main ATP-consuming enzyme of yeast and is thus ideally positioned for sensing cellular ATP levels. Furthermore, as mentioned above, Pma1 stimulation by H<sup>+</sup> influx could also give cells a general mechanism for sensing relief from starvation for any nutrient and for reactivating TORC1 in response to this relief. Other observations support a role of Pma1 in signaling to TORC1. For instance, TORC1 inhibition has been observed when Pma1 synthesis is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dechant et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, yeast TORC1 is rapidly inhibited under glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Urban et al., 2007</xref>), this coinciding with polymerization of the kinase complex into a single, vacuole-associated cylindrical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prouteau et al., 2017</xref>). Although a specific mechanism involving phosphorylation of the Kog1 subunit is reported to contribute to this TORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hughes Hallett et al., 2015</xref>), a role of Pma1 might also be considered, as this H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is subject to rapid and reversible auto-inhibition under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Portillo et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serrano, 1983</xref>). Interestingly, TORC1 has been reported recently to be required for full activity of Pma1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mahmoud et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting the existence of some crosstalk between Pma1 and TORC1. The model according to which Pma1 is capable of controlling TORC1 via signaling also seems reasonable in the light of previous works showing that the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase of animals cells, a P-type ATPase structurally similar to Pma1 and other H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, is engaged in dynamic interactions with other proteins, including the Src tyrosine kinase. The interaction with Src is modulated by the conformation of the ion pump and initiates signal transduction processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui and Xie, 2017</xref>). As the cytosolic region of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase interacting directly with Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lai et al., 2013</xref>) is relatively well conserved in the yeast H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, we introduced several substitutions into this region of Pma1 with a view of disrupting possible interactions with other factors. The generated Pma1 variants, however, behaved normally in TORC1 activation assays.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that cytosolic H<sup>+</sup> and Pma1 are major actors in TORC1 activation in response to active nutrient uptake. They also raise the interesting possibility that Pma1 might control TORC1 via signaling. Further work is needed to evaluate this model, which would open important prospects for work on nutritional signaling in yeast and other organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th colspan="2">Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GFP (mouse monoclonal)</td><td colspan="2">Roche (Belgium)</td><td>11814460001 ;

viewed at room temperature with a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse E600; Nikon) equipped with a 100 differential interference contrast, numerical aperture (NA) 1.40 Plan-Apochromat objective (Nikon) and appropriate fluorescence light filter sets. Images were captured with a digital camera (DXM1200; Nikon) and ACT-1 acquisition software (Nikon) and processed with Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems). In each figure, we typically show only a few cells, representative of the whole population. Labeling of the vacuolar membrane with CMAC fluorescent dye was performed by adding 1 µl of the dye to 5 ml of culture at least 30 min prior to visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Protein extracts and western blotting</title><p>For western blot analysis, crude cell extracts were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hein et al., 1995</xref>). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell; catalog number NBA085B) and probed with mouse anti-GFP (Roche; catalog number 11 814 460 001), anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) (12CA5; Roche), or anti-yeast 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (anti-PGK) (Invitrogen) or with rabbit anti-Pma1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Craene et al., 2001</xref>), anti-phospho-Thr<sup>737</sup>-Sch9, or anti-Sch9<sub>Total</sub> (see below). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche; catalog number 12 015 196 001). Each Western blot was carried two to four times, a representative experiment is presented.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Generation and validation of the anti-phospho-Thr737-Sch9 antibody</title><p>The antibody was produced by and purchased from the GeneCust company. The CKFAGF(pT)FVDESAID peptide containing phosphorylated Thr737 was injected into rabbit. The affinity of the antibody preparation was tested in an ELISA for the phosphorylated peptide. Antibody specificity was tested by western blot analysis of cell extracts isolated from proline-grown wild-type (w-t) and <italic>sch9∆</italic> strains, before and after addition of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, well known to stimulate Sch9 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The anti-Sch9<sub>Total</sub> antibody was a kind gift of Robbie Loewith.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Measurements of cytosolic pH</title><p>Yeast strains expressing a single <italic>pHluorin</italic> gene integrated into the genome or containing a multicopy plasmid expressing the <italic>pHluorin</italic> gene were grown at 29°C on Gluc proline buffered medium, pH 6.1, to OD660 ~0.2. Fluorescence intensities were recorded with a SYNERGY multi-mode microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) with emission filter 512/9 nm and excitation filters 395/9 and 475/9 nm, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orij et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zimmermannova et al., 2015</xref>). To eliminate the background fluorescence, pHluorin-nonproducing wild-type cells were grown in parallel, and the corresponding values at each excitation wavelength were subtracted from those of pHluorin-producing cells. The I395 nm to I475 nm emission intensity ratio was used to calculate the cytosolic pH. The fluorescence intensities of each strain were typically recorded in four separate cultures (1 ml culture per well) within one experiment (technical replicates), and the presented data are means ±SD of at least two independent experiments (biological replicates). The calibration curve was generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orij et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zimmermannova et al., 2015</xref>), with minor changes. The cell culture (100 ml, OD660 = 0.2) was filtered, washed, resuspended in 8 ml phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) containing digitonin (175 μg/ml), and incubated for 15 min at RT. Digitonin was washed out and the cells were resuspended in 8 ml PBS (the OD of the cell suspension was about 2.5) and placed on ice. Then 40 µl aliquots were transferred to CELLSTAR black polystyrene clear-bottom 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One) containing, per well, 160 μl citric acid/Na2HPO4 buffer at a pH ranging from 5.6 to 7.6 (in this volume, the OD was 0.5). Recording of pHluorin fluorescence emission and background subtraction were performed as described above. The I395 nm to I475 nm intensity ratio was calculated, plotted against the corresponding buffer pH, and fitted to a third-degree polynomial regression curve.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Uptake measurements of radiolabelled compounds</title><p>The accumulation of [<sup>14</sup>C]-labeled amino acids or [<sup>14</sup>C]-labeled-fructose was measured at the time points indicated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghaddar et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grenson et al., 1966</xref>). The radiolabeled compounds were purchased either from Perkin-Elmer or from Hartmann analytic. Data points represent averages of two biological replicates; error bars represent standard deviations (SD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Measurement of total amino acid pools</title><p>Yeast cultures (50 ml) were collected by centrifugation (7000 g for 3 min) and washed twice with 10 ml Milli-Q water. The final pellet was resuspended in 2 ml Milli-Q water and boiled for 15 min. To remove cell debris, suspensions were centrifuged at 13,000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min and filtered (Millipore 0.45 μm). The resulting soluble fractions were subjected to amino acid analysis after AccQ Tag pre-column derivatization (Waters). For this an AccQ Tag Ultra UPLC column (Waters) with UV detection at 260 nm was used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fayyad-Kazan et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Assay of trehalase activity in N-deprived cells</title><p>Cells growing on Gluc NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> medium were collected by filtration, and after washing and resuspension in Gluc medium without any N source, they were incubated overnight at 29°C with shaking. Cells were filtered, washed, and transferred again to fresh N-free Gluc medium for 30 min before addition of FCCP (20 μM). Culture samples were collected at various times and trehalase activity was measured in permeabilized cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Virgilio et al., 1991</xref>). Glucose levels were measured using the ‘Glucose assay kit’ (Sigma-Aldrich, Belgium).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Pierre Morsomme, Marc Boutry, Olga Zimmermannova, Hana Sychrova, Paula Gonçalves, Joris Winderickx, Wolf Frommer, Daniel Wipf, and Eckhard Boles for strains and plasmids, and Robbie Loewith for the antibody against Sch9.

We have decided to recommend the manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after major revision.

This can be addressed experimentally. The authors should monitor TORC1 activity over time (with emphasis on the early time points) in ScPma1 and (Np)Pma4<sup>822ochre</sup> expressing cells in response to different amino acids such as leucine (activates TORC1 via Gtr1/2) or glutamine (activates TORC1 also independently of Gtr1/2). They should ideally use <italic>gtr1∆gtr2∆</italic> cells as a control.</p><p>3) Figures 1E, 5C, 5G, Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Total Sch9 levels are not controlled properly. Figure 1—figure supplement 2 shows that the antiserum against dephosphorylated Sch9 is sensitive to phosphorylation. Sch9 immunoblots should be repeated with better reagents.</p><p>4) The authors should determine whether Pib2 or SEACIT/SEACAT components are necessary for proton influx/Pma1 to activate TORC1. Gtr1/2 and Pib2 are believed to function independently, but the evidence does not rule out dependencies. Also, the SEACAT and SEACIT complexes regulate Gtr1/2 and TORC1. Single knockout mutants could be generated and analyzed.</p><p>5) The role of Pma1 in TORC1 activation is intriguing. The use of a separation of function allele of Pma1 that loses the ability to signal to TORC1 would be a good complement to this work. Perhaps a screen for viable Pma1 alleles that present an EGO phenotype (i.e., fail to recover from rapamycin growth arrest) could yield such an allele. This would not be a make-or-break issue for publication but a suggestion to improve the manuscript.</p><p>6) It is known that TORC1 is inactivated when cells are starved for a single amino acid such as leucine (in the case of <italic>leu2∆</italic> cells) or for phosphate, sulfate or zinc. When a single nutrient is lacking, other nutrients are abundant and, in principle, should be able to promote proton influx. The authors should comment about this in the Discussion.</p><p>7) Figures 4G and 4H. FCCP causes cytosolic acidification in 2 min and pH remains almost constant for 30 min. However, Npr1 phosphorylation increases gradually during 30 min of FCCP treatment. How can the authors explain this difference?</p><p>8) Figures 4I and 6K. Npr1 phosphorylation is largely, but not completely, impaired in the <italic>gtr1∆ gtr2∆</italic> strain. The authors should provide an explanation for this residual phosphorylation.

Optional: Since the authors state that glucose-fermenting cells have a high capacity to buffer the cytosol, how does TORC1 activity respond in respiring cells?

This experiment, however, is not easy as transporters from other species are most often poorly active when expressed in yeast. For instance, our first idea was to express in a <italic>gap1 ssy1</italic> mutant, defective in uptake of several amino acids including tryptophan, the human MCT10/TAT1 aromatic amino acid transporter. The group of Fumiyoshi Abe indeed reported that MCT10 expressed in yeast is functional and promotes transport of tryptophan via facilitated diffusion, without the need of an H<sup>+</sup> gradient across the plasma membrane (Uemera et al. BBA vol. 1859, pp. 2076-2085). Dr. Abe kindly sent us a plasmid for expression of MCT10/TAT1 in yeast and we introduced it into the <italic>gap1 ssy1</italic> mutant. However, MCT10/TAT1 was unable to restore growth on aromatic amino acids as sole nitrogen source, indicating that it is not functional (as growth tests are indeed highly sensitive to detect amino-acid permease activities).</p><p>We thus reasoned that it is preferable to compare cells <italic>endogenously</italic> expressing a facilitator or an H<sup>+</sup>-coupled transporter, both recognizing the same compound. Hexoses including fructose are known to be transported into yeast cells via facilitators, namely the Hxt proteins. We contacted our colleague Eckhard Boles who drew our attention on the fact that particular strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> express an H<sup>+</sup>-coupled fructose transporter termed Fsy1. Dr. Paula Gonçalves (Lisbon) who reported this interesting finding kindly sent us strains and plasmids to express Fsy1 in the <italic>hxt</italic> null strain (EBY.VW4000) lacking the <italic>HXT1 to -17</italic> and <italic>GAL2</italic> genes, and thus unable to use glucose or fructose as a carbon source. We thus compared cells of the <italic>hxt</italic> null mutant expressing or not Fsy1. As a control, we used the wild-type CEN.PK2-1c strain (from which EBY.VW4000 derives) expressing the endogenous Hxt facilitators. The strains were first grown on maltose (they can use this carbon source as they still possess their maltose permease genes) and then shifted for a few hours on ethanol, because the <italic>FSY1</italic> gene is more highly expressed on ethanol (Rodrigues de Sousa et al., 2010). As in all other experiments, the nitrogen source was proline. Using these growth conditions, we then set up conditions of equivalent <sup>14</sup>C-fructose uptake in Hxt- and Fsy1-expressing cells. As expected, no significant uptake was detected in the <italic>hxt</italic> null strain. Furthermore, we could nicely confirm that fructose uptake via Fsy1 is inhibited if cells are pretreated with FCCP, this being not the case when this uptake is mediated by the Hxt facilitators. We finally applied these growth and fructose uptake conditions to assay TORC1 activation using Sch9 phosphorylation as a readout. We observed a rapamycin-sensitive increased phosphorylation of Sch9, upon fructose uptake, in Fsy1-expressing cells. Such an activation of TORC1 was not detected in the wild-type incorporating fructose via the Hxt facilitators neither the <italic>hxt</italic> null strain expressing none fructose transporter. These results have now been included as Figures 4G, H, Iandare described in the last paragraph of the subsection “H<sup>+</sup> influx coupled to transport promotes Rag/Gtr-dependent stimulation of TORC1”.</p><p>One comment must be added. The result of this experiment could seem surprising as previous studies reported that addition of glucose (entering cells via Hxt facilitators) to glucose-starved cells reactivates TORC1, assayed also using Sch9 phosphorylation as a readout. These experimental conditions, however, are different from the ones we have applied as we grew cells on maltose and transferred them to ethanol, two carbon sources cells can utilize. In these cells, Pma1 remained active as we could detect an FCCP-sensitive fructose uptake via Fsy1. This markedly contrasts with glucose-starved cells where Pma1 is inhibited and the H<sup>+</sup> gradient at the plasma membrane collapses (see i. e., Figure 4A, 4B). Furthermore, when glucose is provided to glucose-starved cells, Pma1 is rapidly reactivated and this should promote H<sup>+</sup>-coupled uptake of nutrients including amino acids. This H<sup>+</sup>-coupled uptake could contribute to the glucose-elicited reactivation of TORC1. A comment emphasizing this point has also been included in Discussion (second paragraph).</p><p>We have tried to also use HA-Npr1 phosphorylation as a readout of TORC1 activation in response to fructose uptake. We were faced to unexpected difficulties that seem to originate from the fact that under the particular carbon supply conditions used in the experiment, Npr1 undergoes a high basal of phosphorylation largely resistant to rapamycin (data not shown). We have not further investigated this effect (because of a lack of time) and decided to focus on Sch9.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their excellent suggestion as we think that this experiment strongly strengthens the main conclusion of our work, namely that H<sup>+</sup> influx coupled to nutrient uptake is a signal for transient TORC1 activation in yeast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear which amino acids require Pma1 to activate TORC1 and which do not.

We then applied these conditions to analyze TORC1 activation using HA-Npr1 phosphorylation as a readout. The result showed that uptake of Gln, Leu or Arg stimulates TORC1 in (Sc)Pma1 cells (unless rapamycin was present), but not in the (Np)Pma4<sup>822ochre</sup> cells. We additionally analyzed the influence of the <italic>gtr1Δ gtr2Δ</italic> mutations, as requested. None significant increased phosphorylation of HA-Npr1 phosphorylation was detected upon addition of Leu, Gln or Arg to the <italic>gtr1Δ gtr2Δ</italic> strain. These results thus support our conclusion that Pma1 plays an important role in Rag/Gtr-dependent TORC1 activation in response to amino-acid uptake. They have been included as Figure 7—figure supplement 2 in the revised version of our article (Figure 7 is former Figure 6). We describe them in the second paragraph of the subsection “TORC1 activation in response to increased cytosolic H<sup>+</sup> requires the Pma1 H<sup>+</sup> ATPase”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figures 1E, 5C, 5G, Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 2.

The results showed that:</p><p>- Pib2 is not essential to H<sup>+</sup>-influx-elicited TORC1 stimulation.</p><p>- In the <italic>ilm1Δ</italic> mutant, HA-Npr1 displayed a high basal phosphorylation, as expected. Addition of FCCP further increased HA-Npr1 phosphorylation but only after a long incubation time (30 min). This phenotype is similar to the one observed in the <italic>gtr1Δ gtr2Δ</italic> mutant (see new Figure 5D) and show that FCCP also promotes a late TORC1 activation in a manner independent on the Gtr1/2 GTPases and their upstream regulators. This particular point, namely the existence of a late, Gtr-independent, activation of TORC1 upon FCCP addition, has also been raised in comments 7 and 8 (see below our responses).</p><p>- In the <italic>seh1Δ</italic> mutant, FCCP-elicited activation of TORC1 was impaired, at least during the early minutes after FCCP addition. We also noticed that the intensity of the HA-Npr1 signal is much weaker in this strain. This effect was also observed (though less pronounced) in the <italic>gtr1Δ gtr2Δ</italic> (see i.e., Figures 1G, 4E, and new 5D) and <italic>tco89Δ</italic> (our unpublished data) mutants, but its cause remains unclear. It in fact suggests that HA-Npr1 is less abundant when TORC1 is poorly active. Again, addition of FCCP to this strain further increased HA-Npr1 phosphorylation but only after a long incubation time (30 min), as in the <italic>gtr1Δ gtr2Δ</italic> mutant (see comments 7 and 8 below).</p><p>In conclusion, Pib2 is not involved in TORC1 activation in response to H<sup>+</sup>-influx. In contrast, components of the SEACAT and SEACIT complexes seem to play an important role in this activation. Overall these results support the proposed view that TORC1 activation in response to H<sup>+</sup> influx requires the Rag/Gtr GTPases and their SEAC upstream regulators. Pib2, however, already known to act independently of the Gtr1/2, is not essential to this TORC1 activation pathway. These additional results now appear as Figures 5E, 5F, and 5G in the revised version of our article. They are commented on in the second paragraph of the subsection “H<sup>+</sup> diffusion via a protonophore promotes Rag/Gtr-dependent stimulation of TORC1”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The role of Pma1 in TORC1 activation is intriguing. The use of a separation of function allele of Pma1 that loses the ability to signal to TORC1 would be a good complement to this work. Perhaps a screen for viable Pma1 alleles that present an EGO phenotype (i.e., fail to recover from rapamycin growth arrest) could yield such an allele. This would not be a make-or-break issue for publication but a suggestion to improve the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that such allele would beautifully complement our data suggesting a potential regulatory function of Pma1 in TORC1 activation in response to H<sup>+</sup> influx. We thus generated a library of random <italic>pma1</italic> mutants and, after transformation into the <italic>GAL-PMA1 pma2</italic> strain, we tried to positively select on a glucose medium colonies exhibiting increased resistance to rapamycin. We thus tried to isolate Pma1 variants hyperstimulating TORC1. Our first attempts failed: we've obtained resistant clones, but not more than after transformation with a non-mutagenized <italic>PMA1</italic> gene. However, we are not 100% sure that our positive selection method was suited (quality of the library, selection conditions, …). We decided to temporarily put on hold this experiment (because of lack of time) and decided to invest in another approach.</p><p>We indeed found in the literature a very interesting article series showing that the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase of animals cells, similar in sequence to the yeast Pma1 (both belong to the same P-type ATPase structural family), has signaling capabilities. Namely, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is an inhibitor of the Src kinase, and binding of cardiotonic steroids such as ouabain to the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase relieves this inhibition. Remarkably, the group of Zijian XIE identified a cytosolic region in the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase which when mutated provoked a loss of interaction with Src, without affecting the catalytic activity of the ATPase (Lai et al., 2013). We found very interesting the observation that when the sequences of Pma1 and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase were aligned, this particular region appeared well conserved in Pma1. We thus generated several Pma1 mutants harboring substitutions in the depicted sequence, expressed them in the <italic>GAL-pma1 pma2</italic> mutant, and tested their functionality. These substitutions were: A408P, A411P, A411P+A604V, R414A, and C409A+L410A+R414A. Unfortunately, this approach did not lead to any relevant result: Pma1(A408P) turned out to be nonfunctional, and we did not observe any TORC1 activation defect in response to FCCP in cells expressing the other Pma1 mutants (data not shown).</p><p>We hope that the reviewers will appreciate that we did our best to also address this point. For the revised version of our article, we propose (i) to include a comment in Discussion about the illustrated role of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in signaling (ii) to mention that we have tried to introduce into Pma1 substitutions in a similar region, but that these did not impair TORC1 activation (lines 592-602). We think that this comment will emphasize that although it seems reasonable to propose a model whereby Pma1 signals to TORC1 (given the properties of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase), it is far from being demonstrated and requires further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is known that TORC1 is inactivated when cells are starved for a single amino acid such as leucine (in the case of leu2∆ cells) or for phosphate, sulfate or zinc. When a single nutrient is lacking, other nutrients are abundant and, in principle, should be able to promote proton influx. The authors should comment about this in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that two aspects must be considered to explain this apparent paradox. First, reduction of TORC1 activity in cells starved for a single nutrient is probably due to control mechanisms capable of sensing the nutritional status of the cell, and not just to a potential drop of its H<sup>+</sup>-coupled uptake. Consistently, addition to these cells of the limiting nutrient leads to its H<sup>+</sup>-coupled uptake associated with a transient reactivation of TORC1, but more sustained TORC1 activity requires proper assimilation of the nutrient by the cells. Second, it is likely that the drop of TORC1 activity caused by a single starvation not only promotes derepression of high-affinity permeases for the limiting nutrient, but also accelerated endocytosis of the permeases for the non-limiting nutrients. It is indeed known that inhibition of TORC1 by rapamycin promotes endocytosis of many different permeases. This general control is likely associated with a global drop of H<sup>+</sup> influx that could also contribute to the reduction of TORC1 activity despite the abundance of other nutrients in the medium. These two aspects have now been better emphasized in the Discussion of the revised version of our article (second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figures 4G and 4H. FCCP causes cytosolic acidification in 2 min and pH remains almost constant for 30 min. However, Npr1 phosphorylation increases gradually during 30 min of FCCP treatment. How can the authors explain this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that HA-Npr1 phosphorylation further increases after a long incubation in the presence of FCCP (Figure 4H, now Figure 5B). This apparent late activation of TORC1 was also detected in the <italic>gtr1Δ gtr2Δ</italic> strain and in mutants lacking SEACIT or SEACAT upstream regulators of Gtr1/2 (see comment 4 above). Our interpretation is that a longer treatment of cells with FCCP stimulates another TORC1 activation mechanism that is not dependent on the Gtr1/2 GTPases neither their upstream regulators. This is reminiscent of the previous observation by M. Hall and collaborators (Stracka et al., 2014). One possibility is that this late activation of TORC1 is due to FCCP-induced release of amino acids or other compounds stored in the vacuole or mitochondria. This tentative interpretation has now been included in the revised version of the article (subsection “H<sup>+</sup> diffusion via a protonophore promotes Rag/Gtr-dependent stimulation of TORC1”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figures 4I and 6K. Npr1 phosphorylation is largely, but not completely, impaired in the gtr1∆ gtr2∆ strain. The authors should provide an explanation for this residual phosphorylation. This could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 4I (now Figure 5D): as discussed above, we now propose in the text (subsection “H<sup>+</sup> diffusion via a protonophore promotes Rag/Gtr-dependent stimulation of TORC1”, second paragraph) that this Gtr1/2-independent activation of TORC1 might be promoted by amino acids released from the vacuole or mitochondria.</p><p>Figure 6K (now Figure 7K): that phosphorylation of HA-Npr1 in response to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is not impaired in the <italic>gtr1Δ gtr2Δ</italic> strain is expected and consistent with the previous work of Stracka et al. (2014). We think that this was clearly mentioned in the text and does not need to be further emphasized. The interesting result of this experiment is that Pma1 does not play an important role in a TORC1 activation pathway known to be independent on the Gtr1/2 GTPases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Subsection “Inhibition of the vacuolar V-ATPase activates TORC1”. Optional: Since the authors state that glucose-fermenting cells have a high capacity to buffer the cytosol, how does TORC1 activity respond in respiring cells? This could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We could at least show that in cells shifted for six hours on ethanol, TORC1 is activated in response to H<sup>+</sup>-coupled fructose uptake but not passive fructose transport (see point 1). This observation suggests that the activity of TORC1 is also stimulated by H<sup>+</sup> influx in respiring cells, but this question probably needs further investigation beyond the scope of our article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors may wish to discuss their results in light of the recent work demonstrating TORC1 inactivation mediated via assembly into a TOROID (Prouteau M, et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>This reference and a comment have now been included in the text (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Supplementary data is not always appropriately cited from the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Introduction, second paragraph. &quot;RhEB&quot; should be Rheb.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Introduction, third paragraph.
