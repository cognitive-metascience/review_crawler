In this study, we performed chronic telemetric recordings in socially behaving rats to monitor electrophysiological activity in limbic brain regions linked to social behavior. Social encounters were associated with increased rhythmicity in the high theta range (7–10 Hz) that was proportional to the stimulus degree of novelty. This modulation of theta rhythmicity, which was specific for social stimuli, appeared to reflect a brain-state of social arousal. In contrast, the same network responded to a fearful stimulus by enhancement of rhythmicity in the low theta range (3–7 Hz). Moreover, theta rhythmicity showed different pattern of coherence between the distinct brain regions in response to social and fearful stimuli. We suggest that the two types of stimuli induce distinct arousal states that elicit different patterns of theta rhythmicity, which cause the same brain areas to communicate in different modes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03614.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03614.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03614.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For the brain to function correctly, the activities of multiple regions must be coordinated. This coordination is thought to be carried out by waves of electrical activity in the brain. One of the most prominent signals within these waves is called the theta rhythm.</p><p>The theta rhythm is thought to help coordinate neural activity between the regions of the brain that are involved in learning and memory. However, theta rhythms also appear when subjects encounter emotional stimuli, which suggests that they might have a role in social cognition. Consistent with this idea, theta rhythms are reduced in individuals with autism spectrum disorders, but the exact nature of the relationship between theta rhythms and social behavior has remained unclear.</p><p>Tendler and Wagner have now addressed this question directly by implanting electrodes into five brain regions that are active when rats engage in social interactions. Exposing a rat to a social stimulus, such as an unfamiliar visitor rat, caused the intensity of theta rhythms to increase in this network. This change was temporary, with the theta rhythms gradually returning to normal as the novelty of the visitor wore off.</p><p>An increase in the intensity of theta rhythms also occurred in the same network when the rats encountered a fearful stimulus, such as a tone that had previously signaled the delivery of a mild electric shock. Notably, however, the fearful stimulus led to an increase in low frequency theta rhythms, whereas the social stimulus led to an increase in high frequency theta rhythms.</p><p>These results suggest that social and fearful stimuli give rise to two different forms of alertness or arousal, which are reflected by the two types of theta rhythms in this network within the brain. Tendler and Wagner also suggest that the distinct frequencies of theta rhythms might be used to support different forms of communication between various regions of the brain, depending on the emotional value of the stimuli (for example, are they social or fearful stimuli?) encountered by the animal. This means that emotional states might be dictating cognitive processes such as learning and memory.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03614.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03614.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>social recognition memory</kwd><kwd>theta rhythmicity</kwd><kwd>olfactory system</kwd><kwd>medial amygdala</kwd><kwd>arousal</kwd><kwd>fear conditioning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation (ISF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1901/08, 1350/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Shlomo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006259</institution-id><institution>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tendler</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Variations in the frequency of theta brain waves enable a single network of brain regions to generate appropriate responses to stimuli with different kinds of emotional value.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oscillatory brain activity, mostly categorized to the theta (3–12 Hz), beta (12–30 Hz), and gamma (30–80 Hz) bands, is thought to coordinate neural activity in vast neuronal assemblies dispersed over different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004</xref>).

Increasing evidence suggest that individuals with ASD show deficits in long-range neuronal communication associated with low-frequency rhythms, such as the theta rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geschwind and Levitt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rippon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wass, 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, a clear connection between rhythmic brain activity and social behavior has not yet been established.</p><p>Mammalian social organization depends on the ability to recognize and remember individual conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wiley, 2013</xref>). This social recognition memory (SRM) can be assessed in rodents using their innate tendency to investigate novel conspecifics more persistently than familiar ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gheusi et al., 1994</xref>). In the SRM habituation–dishabituation test, social memory is assessed by the gradual reduction in the amount of time the animal spends investigating a particular social stimulus during consecutive encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferguson et al., 2002</xref>). This short-term memory was shown to be mediated mainly by chemical cues (semiochemicals) perceived via the main and accessory olfactory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dulac and Torello, 2003</xref>). Upon binding of semiochemicals to the receptors expressed by the sensory neurons of the main olfactory epithelium and the vomeronasal organ, sensory information is conveyed to the main (MOB) and accessory (AOB) olfactory bulbs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dulac and Wagner, 2006</xref>). Both bulbs then project, directly and indirectly, to the medial amygdala (MeA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pro-Sistiaga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kang et al., 2011</xref>) that is thought to transfer the information to the hippocampus through the lateral septum (LS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bielsky and Young, 2004</xref>).

To examine this hypothesis, we recorded electrophysiological activity from the brains of freely behaving adult male rats performing the SRM paradigm (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). A telemetric system was used to record from wire electrodes chronically implanted in the five aforementioned brain regions: MOB, AOB, MeA, LS, and Pir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dulac and Wagner, 2006</xref>). We found that social encounters were associated with enhancement of brain rhythmic activity, specifically at 7–10 Hz range, in all brain regions. This enhancement that was proportional to the degree of novelty of the social stimulus appeared to reflect an internal brain-state associated with social arousal. In contrast, a fear-conditioned tone, which is associated with fear arousal, induced rhythmicity in the low theta range (3–7 Hz) in the same network of brain regions. Moreover, social and fearful stimuli elicited different patterns of change in coherence between the distinct brain regions. We hypothesize that these two types of stimuli induce distinct arousal states in the animal, which are reflected by the different kinds of theta rhythmicity. We further suggest that the distinct types of theta rhythmicity support different modes of communication between the various brain areas. These in turn may modify cognitive processes such as memory acquisition and recall depending on the value and saliency of the stimulus by enhancing synchronous neuronal activity between remote neuronal assemblies.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="wmv" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03614-media1.wmv"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03614.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Social encounter between two adult male rats in the experimental arena.</title><p>The recorded subject carries a black transmitter equipped with a flashing led light on its head.

A highly rhythmic LFP was recorded in all brain areas during social encounters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

In all regions tested, the theta power decreased gradually during the habituation phase (Enc. 1–4) but returned the values obtained in Enc. 1 after dishabituation (Enc. 5) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005 one-way repeated measures ANOVA, <italic>*p</italic><sub>corr</sub> &lt; 0.05 <italic>post-hoc</italic> paired t-test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1–2</xref>).

Taken together, these results show that in almost all recorded brain areas, theta power is modulated by the degree of novelty of social but not object stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The modulation of theta rhythmicity during social encounters is driven by an internal brain state of arousal</title><p>The lack of theta power modulation despite the clear investigation time modulation induced by object stimuli rejects the possibility that the theta rhythmicity is caused by the investigative behavior. We therefore reasoned that rather, theta power modulation may reflect processes that are either directly driven by the sensory input (Bottom-Up processes) or induced by an internal state of the brain that is modulated by the saliency of the social stimulus (Top-Down processes). In order to distinguish between these two possibilities, we continued our recordings for 5 min after the stimulus was removed from the arena (Post 1–5). As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the theta rhythmicity did not cease with the removal of the social stimulus following Enc. 1, but remained at a high level during most of the Post 1 period (for spectrograms of the full experiment, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s2 fig4s3 fig4s4 fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 1–5</xref>). Plotting the mean instantaneous theta power as a function of time, revealed that this was true for all encounters with a social stimulus. In contrast, encounters with object stimuli were followed by a sharp drop in the theta power to a low level almost immediately following stimulus removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, for all other brain areas see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6 fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplements 6–7</xref>). This significant reduction in mean theta power between the Enc. and Post periods of the object paradigm was characteristic of all brain areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 paired t-test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

Moreover, all encounters with social stimuli showed a steep but gradual increase in theta power during the first 15 s in which the stimulus was being transferred into the arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D</xref>, gray bars). This rise in theta power probably reflects the subject's anticipation for a social meeting, as there was no similar increase with object stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that the changes in theta power during the SRM test reflect a graded internal brain state of arousal that is proportional to the novelty of the social stimulus and slowly fades away after its removal.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03614.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Modulation of the theta rhythmicity by social stimulus novelty reflects an internal state in the brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Color-coded spectrograms of the LFP recorded in the MOB (upper), LS (middle), and MeA (lower) for 5 min before (Base), during (Enc. 1), and after (Post 1) the first encounter of the SRM test.

In that case, the various brain regions are expected to display high correlation and similar dynamics of coherence in their rhythmicity. Alternatively, if it represents a combination of multiple independent rhythms arising from several sources, we expect low correlation and differential dynamics of coherence between various brain regions. To discriminate between these possibilities, we first examined the cross-correlation of the LFP, filtered in the theta range, between the MeA and the other brain areas. Despite the fact that both areas are directly connected to the MeA, the strongest correlation appeared with the LS and the weakest with the MOB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Moreover, whereas the correlation between the MeA and LS was significantly higher during Enc. 1 (blue) compared to Base (red), the MOB showed consistently low correlation with the MeA during both periods. The presence of a social stimulus thus appears to differentially affect the correlation of theta rhythmicity between distinct brain areas.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03614.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Differential and dynamic correlation of theta rhythmicity between specific brain regions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upper—superimposed LFP traces (filtered 5–11 Hz) from the MeA (black) and LS (colored) of one animal during Base (left, red) and Enc. 1 (right, blue).

As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, the coherence between the MeA and the LS showed several prominent peaks, especially in the theta and gamma bands. Yet, while no change was recorded in the gamma band, the theta coherence showed a significant increase between the Base and Enc. 1. Furthermore, similarly to theta rhythmicity itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the high coherence at theta range persisted during the Post 1 period despite the lack of a social stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>). In contrast, the coherence in theta band between the MeA and MOB remained low throughout all periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Analyses across all regions revealed a hierarchy in the theta coherence between the MeA and all other areas, ranging from a low level with the MOB and AOB, medium coherence with the Pir and high coherence with the LS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This notion of functional hierarchy between brain regions is strengthened by the fact that despite their largest physical distance, the highest level of theta coherence was found between the MeAs in the two hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 1,3</xref>). Furthermore, the theta coherence between the MeA and the higher brain centers (Pir, LS) significantly increased during Enc. 1 and Post 1 (*<italic>p</italic><sub>corr</sub> &lt; 0.05, paired t-test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), while no change was recorded between the MeA and both areas of the olfactory bulb (MOB, AOB, <italic>p</italic><sub>corr</sub> &gt; 0.05). This suggests the existence of at least two independent theta rhythms, one that governs the olfactory bulb and another that dominates higher brain structures. This conclusion is further supported by the findings that the MOB shows opposite relationships with all other brain areas; high coherence with the AOB and low coherence with the higher areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2 fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 2,3</xref>).

Interestingly, similar enhancement of theta coherence between the AOB and MOB was recorded with object stimuli, while these stimuli did not cause any enhancement of the coherence between the MeA and LS or Pir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>).

This phenomenon was best studied in the context of fear learning in a network of brain regions comprising the basolateral complex of the amygdala (lateral and basolateral amygdala), hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pape and Pare, 2010</xref>). In this network, a recall of a fearful memory, induced by a fear-conditioned stimulus, elicits robust theta rhythmicity that shows high coherence between these brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Paré and Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pare et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Seidenbecher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pape et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Popa et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we examined whether the brain state-induced theta rhythmicity during the SRM paradigm is similar to the fear-induced rhythmicity. To address this question, we compared the theta rhythmicity induced by a social encounter to that of a fear stimulus within the social network that we investigated. To that end, a new cohort of six animals was implanted with wire electrodes as before, with an additional electrode in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), which was recently shown to be involved in social motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dölen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>). These animals were fear-conditioned by coupling a 40-s long tone to an electrical foot shock for five consecutive times separated by 180-s intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A day later the electrical activity was recorded in two consecutive sessions, each following a 30 min of habituation to the arena. The first session was recorded during a recall of fear memory (FC experiment), and the second during a 5-min long encounter with a novel social stimulus (SR experiment). During the FC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), introduction of the fear-conditioned tone caused animals to begin moving intensively, followed by immobility (freezing) towards the end of the tone, in anticipation of the foot shock. The freezing response was especially significant at the end of the first tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, the fear-conditioned tone caused a robust arousal state that was associated with intense movement of the conditioned animals. We then compared the theta rhythmicity between the FC and SR experiments. A PSD analysis of the LFP signals recorded in the LS during 5 min prior to stimulus introduction (Base) yielded a similar profile in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, red). However, the PSD was very different between the two types of stimuli during the first 15 s following stimulus introduction (Stimulus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, blue). Whereas the fear stimulus caused a marked peak at the low theta range (3–7 Hz), the social stimulus resulted in a peak at the high theta range (7–10 Hz). This change is clearly observed when subtracting the Base PSD from the Stimulus profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These differences appeared in all recorded brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and Statistical analysis showed a highly significant interaction between the type of experiment (FC or SR) and theta band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) (<italic>**</italic><italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, two-way repeated measures ANOVA, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Thus, we conclude that fearful and social stimuli cause changes in very different ranges of theta rhythmicity in the same limbic network of brain regions. We suggest that these different types of theta rhythmicity reflect distinct arousal states; the low theta reflects aversive arousal that is associated with fear while the high theta reflects appetitive arousal associated with a social encounter.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03614.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Distinct types of theta rhythmicity are induced by social and fearful stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PSD analyses (0–20 Hz) of LFP signal recorded in the LS of one animal, 5 min prior to stimulus introduction (Base, red) and 15 s following it (Stimulus, blue) during fear memory recall (left, FC) and social encounter (right, SR).

Strikingly, the change in theta rhythmicity is directly proportional to the novelty of the social partner, and may thus be considered a neuronal correlate of short-term social memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liebe et al., 2012</xref>). Since the modulation of theta rhythmicity is observed even when anesthetized stimuli are used, we infer that it does not depend on the behavior of the social stimulus. Despite the similarity in investigative behavior, such modulation of theta rhythmicity is not observed with object stimuli, suggesting that it is social specific. Since the augmented theta rhythmicity and the associated increase in theta coherence persist beyond the removal of the social stimulus itself, we conclude that these parameters do not mirror sensory inputs but rather reflect a state of arousal that slowly fades away. This is in agreement with the fact that the increase in theta power occurs prior to the actual introduction of the social stimulus in the arena, suggesting increased arousal due to the anticipated social encounter. Finally, since the change in theta rhythmicity during the SRM test correlates with the novelty of the social stimulus, we posit that it reflects a graded level of arousal, which is proportional to the stimulus saliency.</p><p>One of the questions that arise from the study is whether the social encounter-induced state of arousal is elicited by the ‘social’ quality of the stimulus or whether it simply results from the complexity of the stimulus. Notably, the social stimulus is much more complex than the single object or odor stimuli that we used as controls. It emits a complex mixture of odors and semiochemicals, and in addition to the main and accessory olfactory systems, it also stimulates the visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems. It is not likely that the full complexity of the social stimulus may be mimicked by the use of any artificial mixture of odors, hence the possibility that the arousal state results from the complexity of the stimulus cannot be excluded. On the other hand, at least as regards to fear-associated arousal, it is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>) that a very simple cue is sufficient to evoke a state of arousal, such that is observed by the freezing of rodents in response to the pure odorant 2,3,5-Trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT), a component of fox odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fendt et al., 2003</xref>), or to a pure tone in a fear conditioning paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rogan et al., 1997</xref>). This suggests that the factor that determines the state of arousal is not the complexity of the stimulus but rather the information it embodies with regards to the natural environment of the animal.</p><p>Many studies, both in animals and humans, have linked brain theta rhythmicity to the processing of emotional cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sainsbury and Montoya, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sainsbury et al., 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sainsbury et al., 1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aftanas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balconi and Pozzoli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knyazev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maratos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luo et al., 2013</xref>). In animals theta rhythmicity was mostly studied in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>), where it was classified into two types, Type 1 and Type 2. The atropine-insensitive Type 1 theta rhythmicity shows higher frequency (8–12 Hz) and is thought to be associated mainly with voluntary movement. In contrast, atropine-sensitive Type 2 rhythmicity is characterized by lower frequency (4–8 Hz) and is thought to be linked to arousal during states of immobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bland, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sainsbury, 1998</xref>). Notably, Type 2 rhythmicity was mostly studied using states of fear and aversive stimuli and was shown to be induced by neutral stimuli if conditioned by fear or introduced in the presence of predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sainsbury and Montoya, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sainsbury et al., 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sainsbury et al., 1987b</xref>). The relationship of the two types of hippocampal theta rhythmicity and similar rhythms recorded from other brain regions, such as in our case, should be cautiously examined for several reasons. First, recent studies showed that in the hippocampus itself there are differences in the profile of theta rhythmicity between the earlier studied dorsal hippocampus and the more recently studied ventral hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>), the latter of which shows theta rhythmicity with stronger association to the one recoded in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacinto et al., 2013</xref>), and may be dissociated from the dorsal hippocampus under certain conditions such as decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). Second, even for the dorsal hippocampus the dichotomy between the two types of theta rhythmicity is far from being perfect with Type 2 rhythmicity reported to reach 12 Hz at some states and Type 1 rhythmicity reported to disappear during certain movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sainsbury, 1998</xref>). Interestingly, researchers reported that in cats the correlation between movement and Type 1 rhythmicity was good at the beginning of the experiments, when a lot of exploratory and object manipulation behavior was observed, but deteriorated towards the end of the experiments, when the animals were still moving but were uninterested in the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sainsbury, 1998</xref>). This might suggest that in the hippocampus too, high frequency Type 1 theta may be associated with sensory information processing during ‘positive’ arousal states associated with motivational voluntary movements, such as exploration, while low frequency Type 2 theta may be linked to ‘negative’ arousal states, such as those caused by fear, which is usually associated with freezing.</p><p>Regardless of the nature of hippocampal theta oscillations, theta rhythmicity associated with emotional states was reported in several other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bland et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bland and Oddie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pignatelli et al., 2012</xref>). Of particular interest is the finding that theta rhythmicity in a limbic network that includes the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex and the basolateral complex of the amygdala (lateral and basolateral amygdala) is associated with fear memories. Importantly, the consolidation and recall of long-term fear memory was found to be associated with elevated coherence of the theta rhythmicity in this network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Paré and Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Seidenbecher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pape et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Popa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lesting et al., 2013</xref>), while its extinction was associated with a decline in coherence, in a brain-region dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Narayanan et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, interfering with theta coherence through local electrical micro-stimulation affected fear-memory recall and extinction depending on theta phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lesting et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, coordinated arousal-induced theta rhythmicity within this network seems to be involved in consolidation and recall of aversive memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Popa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lesting et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we demonstrated for the first time that similar phenomena occur in a distinct network of limbic areas that are linked to social memory, in the course of social encounters. Importantly, a comparison of the theta activity between social and fearful stimuli revealed that although both cause a state of arousal, the patterns of theta rhythmicity and coherence within the same network are completely different. First, in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Paré and Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Seidenbecher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pape et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Popa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lesting et al., 2013</xref>), the recall of fear memory causes rhythmicity in the low theta range, while a social encounter elicits rhythmic activity in the high theta range. This suggests the existence of two types of arousal: fear-associated arousal and social-related arousal. Second, each of these conditions caused a distinct pattern of coherence changes between the same regions of the network. Given these results, we hypothesize that the distinct types of theta rhythmicity promote different communication protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kepecs et al., 2006</xref>) for the coordination of neural activity in the network, which depends on the emotional state of the animal. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that theta rhythmicity facilitates cognitive processes such as memory formation that are associated with emotionally salient stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelletier and Paré, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The source and distribution of theta rhythms in the mammalian brain are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pignatelli et al., 2012</xref>). This issue was extensively studied in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>), which was shown to have the capacity to self-generate theta rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goutagny et al., 2009</xref>). Yet, as described above theta rhythmicity also exists in various cortical and limbic areas, where it shows dynamic coherence with the hippocampal theta rhythm. One area shown to display robust theta rhythmicity is the olfactory bulb, where it follows the rhythm of respiration (‘sniff cycle’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rojas-Libano et al., 2014</xref>). Sniffing, similarly to whisking, is a sensory sampling activity, the rate of which dynamically changes throughout the theta band and is strongly influenced by internal arousal and motivational state of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clarke and Trowill, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang, 1992</xref>). Specifically, high-frequency sniffing (8–12 Hz) develops in anticipation of reward delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freeman et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monod et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kepecs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wesson et al., 2008</xref>). The olfactory bulb theta rhythm and sniffing are not usually coherent with the hippocampal rhythm. However, in some odor-based learning tasks these rhythms do become transiently coherent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Macrides et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martin et al., 2007</xref>), a process that was suggested to be mediated by cholinergic neurons in the medial septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tsanov et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, whisking was shown to get occasionally phase locked with the sniff cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ranade et al., 2013</xref>) or with the hippocampal theta rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Komisaruk, 1970</xref>) during exploratory behavior. Thus, various generators of theta rhythmicity in the brain, such as those reflected by sniffing, whisking, or the hippocampal theta rhythm may become dynamically coupled by the brain neuromodulatory systems. While we did not monitor sniffing in our experiments, several recent studies reported changes in sniffing during both social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wesson, 2013</xref>) and fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shionoya et al., 2013</xref>). These studies showed that the sniff cycle adopt high-range theta rhythmicity during social interactions and low-range rhythmicity during fear conditioning. These differences are probably reflected by the distinct rates of theta rhythmicity that we record in the MOB and AOB during these conditions. This may explain our observation of high coherence between MOB-AOB and the low coherence each of them display with all other regions. Moreover, while the coherence between the MOB-AOB is increased during exploration of both social and object stimuli, the coherence between the LS–MeA increases only during social interactions. Thus, the theta rhythmicity displayed by the AOB and MOB probably emerges from a distinct generator, most likely the sniff cycle, that is separate from the one causing rhythmicity in higher brain areas. Furthermore, the significant differences in correlation and coherence dynamics between the various limbic areas suggest the involvement of distinct generators as well. For example, neither paradigm showed significant coherence changes between the LS-NAcc, as opposed to a significant increase in coherence between the LS-MeA or LS-Pir during social interactions. It should be noted that these differences cannot not be accounted for by local diffusion of LFP signals, since the LS is much closer to the NAcc than to the MeA or Pir. Direct synaptic connections cannot explain these differences either as the MeA shows very low coherence with the AOB, despite the strong bidirectional connections between them, but rather displays the highest coherence with the contralateral MeA, despite the lack of direct synaptic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Canteras et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, the differential coherence changes between distinct pairs of brain regions during the various conditions are most likely mediated by either a common input to these regions or via brain-region specific neuromudulatory systems. However, the arousal-driven modulation of theta rhythmicity which seems to be common to all brain regions is probably mediated by a general, brain-wide neuromodulatory mechanism such as neurohormonal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marder, 2012</xref>).</p><p>An ever growing body of evidence implies rhythmic brain activity in various cognitive processes, particularly in memory acquisition and recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buzsáki and Watson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cannon et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, slow frequency rhythms such as the theta rhythm, are hypothesized to mediate communication between brain regions and to promote the temporal binding of neural assemblies in these areas into coherent networks subserving specific cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jutras and Buffalo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benchenane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>). During the last decade, several prominent theories implied a disordered or weak communication among brain regions as a major deficit underlying ASD etiology and symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brock et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Uhlhaas and Singer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geschwind and Levitt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wass, 2011</xref>). Indeed, multiple recent studies found reduction in the power and coherence of slow brain rhythms, such as the alpha and theta rhythms, in ASD individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murias et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coben et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barttfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doesburg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Machado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kikuchi et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with these findings, our results suggest that arousal-driven theta rhythmicity may help bind correlated neuronal assemblies in distinct brain areas participating in cognitive and emotional processes underlying social behavior. A disruption of the correlated neuronal activity associated with the theta rhythmicity is likely to impair these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Uhlhaas and Singer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geschwind and Levitt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buzsáki and Watson, 2012</xref>) resulting in atypical social behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats (5–6 weeks of age, 250–300 gr) served as subjects while SD or Wistar Hola/Hannover male rats (5–6 weeks of age, 250–300 gr) served as stimuli.

For smell recognition, we used small metal-net balls filled with cloth soaked with artificial food smells of citrus and vanilla. The metal-net ball was attached to the cage floor by hot melt adhesive. It should be noted that obviously, both object and smell stimuli are much poorer sources of chemosignals that social stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fear conditioning</title><p>Fear conditioning took place in a Plexiglas rodent conditioning chamber with a metal grid floor dimly illuminated by a single house light and enclosed within a sound attenuating chamber (Coulbourn Instruments, Lehigh Valley, PA, USA). Rats were habituated to the chamber for 1 hr before fear conditioning. During fear conditioning rats were presented with five pairings of a tone (CS; 40 s, 5 kHz, 75 dB) that co-terminated with a foot-shock (US; 0.5 s, 1.3 mA). The inter-trial interval was 180 s. The fear recall experiments were conducted a day later in the experimental arena described above, using the same procedure without the electrical foot shocks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histology</title><p>After completion of the experiments, the rats were anesthetized and killed with an overdose of Isoflurane (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA). The brains are removed and placed in PFA (4% in PBS) over night, followed by sectioning to 200-µm slices using vibrating slicer (Vibroslice, Campden Instruments, Lafayette, IN, USA).

Each brain region was separately analyzed. Parametric t-test and ANOVA tests were used if data were found to be normally distributed (Lilliefors and Shapiro–Wilk tests). Bonferroni's corrections were performed for multiple comparisons using t-test. One-sided t-tests were used when a change in specific direction was expected before the experiment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Liza Barki-Harrington for a helpful reading of this manuscript.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. We regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication. We should stress that it is <italic>eLife's</italic> policy to not ask for extensive revisions, and when it appears that significant work would be needed to bring a manuscript to the stage necessary for publication, we feel it is fairer to the authors to reject the paper and allow them the freedom to prepare it for publication elsewhere, with the advantage of the information found in these reviews.</p><p>This manuscript describes an ambitious and interesting study looking at theta oscillatory activity in olfactory, amygdala and basal forebrain areas in rats during social interactions of varying novelty. The authors interpret their results as showing that social memory is correlated with theta activity in the lateral septum and amygdala but not in lower tier olfactory areas. What this means is that theta power in LS and MeA decreases as the same stranger rat is repeatedly presented and then increases when a new rat is presented. Such theta power-tracking of novelty does not occur in AOB or MOB or Pir Ctx or in any area when rats are tested with metal objects or scented objects. In addition there was a theta index which measured the correspondence of MUA with theta power. The authors suggest that the theta response is centrally driven in an arousal dependent manner, and that socially driven theta oscillations in this circuit help bind diverse limbic areas important in this behavior. They further speculate that reported impairment in theta in the autistic spectrum population may contribute to impaired social function.</p><p>The reviewers were intrigued but there were several major points that detracted from their enthusiasm:</p><p>First and foremost, the social nature of the stimulus was not convincingly parsed from the arousing nature of the stimulus. A non-smelly metal object and an object with a volatile odor that activates MOB glomeruli are not controls for arousal.</p><p>Second, there are a number of methodological descriptions (eg theta index was not clearly understood by any of the reviewers) that were unclear and statistical tests which appear to be wrong. A full list is included below.</p><p>Third, the authors fail to cite a long literature showing that AOB /MOB theta is a respiratory rhythm which is independent of the olfactory respiratory rhythm. The piriform cortex is known to participate in both the respiratory rhythm and more central theta rhythms, which explains its midpoint position in the coherence strength spectrum among the areas studied here. The large change in AOB and MOB theta power during social stimulation speaks to the odor profile of a conspecific engaging robust sniffing behavior.</p><p>We have included the full set of reviews so that you can get a sense of the issues raised by each reviewer in their initial reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>This paper is an interesting communication that makes a strong case for a physiological correlate for social memory. There are several interesting features to the findings. The social memory is correlated with activity in the lateral septum and amygdala and not in lower tier olfactory areas. While I am not completely convinced by the story, I believe that the data are sufficiently compelling that readers should evaluate the case for themselves.</p><p>1) One idea that is not tested is whether or not the social memory is for smell mediated by the VNO. The smell controls were typical volatile odorants that would be processed by the main olfactory epithelium (clove, vanilla). The fact that MOE-mediated odorants do not engage the same responses as individual animals is not that surprising. Observing the response to smells from the urine and feces of two different animals would be more compelling.</p><p>2) Theta power is not related to the stimulus animal being awake or anesthetized (but see below) nor is it related to the investigative behavior. This is interpreted as TP being related to neither stimulus nor behavior but rather to an internal state. Another interpretation would be that TP is related to an unrecorded behavior.</p><p>3) Conclusions from two animals, two recordings, regarding the issue of awake or anesthetized, is an uncomfortably low sample size. While these observations are worth noting in the Discussion, without more data, I would recommend not making this point part of the results.</p><p>4) Finally, how do the results distinguish between the favored top-down model and the possibility of the rhythm as an emergent property of two related areas?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This paper addresses the theta rhythm as a coupling mechanism among areas involved in social communication. The data show modulation of theta power and coherence as well as multiunit firing increases and decreases and modulation by theta in response to several types of stimuli. Recordings are done in two primary olfactory areas (MOB, AOB), piriform cortex, medial amygdala and lateral septum. While several of these areas are activated in what is described as a social network, they all participate in many other functions: piriform cortex–olfaction; medial amygdala–emotional processing and olfaction; lateral septum–theta rhythmicity associated with learning and other hippocampal functions. The authors conclude that they have shown that the social areas are preferentially activated by social stimuli. I am not convinced that they have shown anything more than an arousing multimodal stimulus, which happens to be a conspecific and therefore very arousing, can enhance theta rhythms in the limbic areas. The controls are rather impoverished stimuli (clean office supplies, odor in a tea ball). I also have some serious concerns about the statistical methods as detailed below.</p><p>Methods and statistics:</p><p>1) Were spikes and fields recorded from the same electrodes? If so, was there any check to be sure that the LFP did not contaminate the MUA or vice versa?</p><p>2) The band pass for theta is very narrow. This can result in artifactual change in theta power and phase. Please use a much wider band or a low pass filter some larger distance from the end of the band of interest.</p><p>3) How do the authors know that the amygdala LFP does not come from the piriform cortex, which is very close by? The spectrograms look quite similar.</p><p>4) The method for analyzing MUA is incorrect. From what I can understand of the description (which is not very clear), it appears that all data were pooled across subjects, with those contributing more spikes weighted more, and the resulting pooled data analyzed. Each subject should be analyzed separately and a mean value derived for that subject. Then the statistical tests should be performed.</p><p>5) The description of the theta index is very difficult to understand. Is a 60 sec bin correct? That seems a couple of orders of magnitude too large, especially to resolve something on the order of 10s of msecs.</p><p>6) It seems that in every analysis a different statistical test is used. Please justify the choice of the various tests. Also, using one-sided t-tests and a large number of t-tests when an ANOVA is a more appropriate test needs to be justified. If many t-tests are used to compare each area separately, a Bonferroni or other correction is necessary to adjust for the multiple tests.</p><p>7) deltaTP should use a division of baseline power instead of a subtraction.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows a mean across all brain areas (3A). This measure doesn't offer any information about the system and is an incorrect treatment of power. Power of a signal in any area depends on the circuits in that area. Theta may be big or small but what matters is its power relative to other frequencies in that area.</p><p>9) There are many differences between social stimuli and objects that have nothing to do with the social aspect. One is that the live animal stimulus moves in somewhat unpredictable manner or an anesthetized conspecific that is rather confusing. Another is that the odor of the stimulus is very complex, especially as compared to clean office supplies. Also, the waking conspecific can be a threatening stimulus (one aspect of social) and arousal from this emotional state can persist longer than whatever arousal is produced by office supplies. Is the emotional state the object of interest or the social aspect? None of the other stimuli were arousing.

We would therefore greatly appreciate an opportunity to re-submit this manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The main criticism was for the lack of non-social arousing control. We directly addressed this criticism by examining the theta rhythmicity in the network during fear conditioning, a situation previously shown to be accompanied by arousaldriven theta rhythmicity in other brain regions. These results, presented in the second part of the manuscript, significantly changed the paper that now mainly deals with the LFP signals. Therefore, we omitted the MUA data, the importance of which became marginalized in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>This paper is an interesting communication that makes a strong case for a physiological correlate for social memory. There are several interesting features to the findings. The social memory is correlated with activity in the lateral septum and amygdala and not in lower tier olfactory areas. While I am not completely convinced by the story, I believe that the data are sufficiently compelling that readers should evaluate the case for themselves</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) One idea that is not tested is whether or not the social memory is for smell mediated by the VNO. The smell controls were typical volatile odorants that would be processed by the main olfactory epithelium (clove, vanilla). The fact that MOE-mediated odorants do not engage the same responses as individual animals is not that surprising. Observing the response to smells from the urine and feces of two different animals would be more compelling</italic>.</p><p>In our manuscript we do not try to tell between the main and accessory olfactory systems in terms of function. Our vision, shared by many other scientists, is that both systems act synergistically to process social chemosensory cues during social interactions and that it would be very difficult to distinguish between their contributions without using genetic tools. Thus, we recorded from areas associated with both systems. Indeed, our results point to the distinction between the olfactory bulb and higher brain centers as more relevant to theta rhythmicity than the difference between the main and accessory systems.</p><p><italic>2) Theta power is not related to the stimulus animal being awake or anesthetized (but see below) nor is it related to the investigative behavior. This is interpreted as TP being related to neither stimulus nor behavior but rather to an internal state. Another interpretation would be that TP is related to an unrecorded behavior</italic>.</p><p>The reason why we do not think that any external factor is driving the theta rhythmicity is the variable coherence of this rhythmicity between the various brain regions. This variability cannot be explained if one rhythmic behavior drives all theta rhythmicity in the brain. Moreover, we are continuing a long trail of studies showing that theta rhythmicity in many brain areas is associated with arousal state and that the behavioral parameters such as sniffing and whisking are driven by the internal theta rhythmicity rather than driving it. This issue is widely discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Conclusions from two animals, two recordings, regarding the issue of awake or anesthetized is an uncomfortably low sample size. While these observations are worth noting in the Discussion, without more data, I would recommend not making this point part of the results</italic>.</p><p>We accept the criticism and omitted the conclusion (regarding the stimulus behavior) from the Results section.</p><p><italic>4) Finally</italic>, <italic>how do the results distinguish between the favored top-down model and the possibility of the rhythm as an emergent property of two related areas?</italic></p><p>The top-down process is supported mainly by the fact that theta rhythmicity is similarly modulated by stimulus novelty in all brain areas, despite the highly variable coherence between them. This suggests that several sources of theta rhythmicity in the brain are influenced by a top-down process which is related to the stimulus novelty. Practically, such influence may be mediated by a common input from a higher brain center or a neuromodulatory system with a brain-wide influence. This issue is discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>This paper addresses the theta rhythm as a coupling mechanism among areas involved in social communication. The data show modulation of theta power and coherence as well as multiunit firing increases and decreases and modulation by theta in response to several types of stimuli. Recordings are done in two primary olfactory areas (MOB, AOB), piriform cortex, medial amygdala and lateral septum. While several of these areas are activated in what is described as a social network, they all participate in many other functions: piriform cortex</italic>–<italic>olfaction; medial amygdala</italic>–<italic>emotional processing and olfaction; lateral septum</italic>–<italic>theta rhythmicity associated with learning and other hippocampal functions. The authors conclude that they have shown that the social areas are preferentially activated by social stimuli. I am not convinced that they have shown anything more than an arousing multimodal stimulus, which happens to be a conspecific and therefore very arousing, can enhance theta rhythms in the limbic areas. The controls are rather impoverished stimuli (clean office supplies, odor in a tea ball). I also have some serious concerns about the statistical methods as detailed below</italic>.</p><p><italic>Methods and statistics</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Were spikes and fields recorded from the same electrodes? If so</italic>, <italic>was there any check to be sure that the LFP did not contaminate the MUA or vice versa?</italic></p><p>We are using methodology which is well accepted in the field and was used by many very well published studies, some of which are cited in the manuscript. Generally, the possibility of contamination of the LFP by the MUA is relevant for high-frequency rhythms such as the gamma rhythm (100Hz), where only one order of magnitude separate between the signal widths. In the case of theta rhythmicity (10Hz), where two order of magnitude, separate between the signals, we do not expect any contamination.</p><p><italic>2) The band pass for theta is very narrow. This can result in artifactual change in theta power and phase. Please use a much wider band or a low pass filter some larger distance from the end of the band of interest</italic>.</p><p>The band-pass filter does not cause any distortion of the TP. This can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>, where unfiltered data is analyzed suing the same methodology and we get the same results. The filtering is only making the peak location clearer.</p><p><italic>3) How do the authors know that the amygdala LFP does not come from the piriform cortex, which is very close by? The spectrograms look quite similar</italic>.</p><p>The LFP signals of the MeA and Pir are not especially similar. It can be seen very well in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4–figure supplement 7</xref>, where the instantaneous TP of both structures are shown together. Also, the MeA signals show only moderate coherence with the Pir LFP, relative to the LS or contralateral MeA, both of which are remote from the MeA. This issue is discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The method for analyzing MUA is incorrect. From what I can understand of the description (which is not very clear), it appears that all data were pooled across subjects, with those contributing more spikes weighted more, and the resulting pooled data analyzed. Each subject should be analyzed separately and a mean value derived for that subject. Then the statistical tests should be performed</italic>.</p><p>Not relevant anymore since the MUA data are not included in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) The description of the theta index is very difficult to understand. Is a 60 sec bin correct? That seems a couple of orders of magnitude too large, especially to resolve something on the order of 10s of msecs</italic>.</p><p>Not relevant anymore since the MUA data are not included in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) It seems that in every analysis a different statistical test is used. Please justify the choice of the various tests. Also, using one-sided t-tests and a large number of t-tests when an ANOVA is a more appropriate test needs to be justified. If many t-tests are used to compare each area separately, a Bonferroni or other correction is necessary to adjust for the multiple tests</italic>.</p><p>Generally, each brain region was analyzed separately. All multiple comparisons were corrected using Bonferroni's corrections and this is explicitly written in the relevant figure legends, as well as in a section of “statistics” added to the Methods in the revised manuscript. As explained, one-sided t-tests were used when a change in specific direction was expected before the experiment.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: We used repeated measures 1-way ANOVA to examine the possibility of significant differences between encounters and then post-hoc t-tests (corrected for multiple comparisons) to examine the habituation and dishabituation phases. The t-tests were used to minimize the number of post-hoc comparisons within the model.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: We used t-test rather than ANOVA since the only desired comparison was between the Encounter and Post periods for each experiment.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: t-tests, corrected for multiple comparisons, were used to compare</p><p>between the Encounter and Base periods and between the Post and Base periods.

Mathematically, subtraction after log is the same as dividing the parameters before log.</p><p><italic>8)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>shows a mean across all brain areas (3A). This measure doesn't offer any information about the system and is an incorrect treatment of power. Power of a signal in any area depends on the circuits in that area. Theta may be big or small but what matters is its power relative to other frequencies in that area</italic>.</p><p>The mean was removed from the figure.</p><p><italic>9) There are many differences between social stimuli and objects that have nothing to do with the social aspect. One is that the live animal stimulus moves in somewhat unpredictable manner or an anesthetized conspecific that is rather confusing. Another is that the odor of the stimulus is very complex, especially as compared to clean office supplies. Also, the waking conspecific can be a threatening stimulus (one aspect of social) and arousal from this emotional state can persist longer than whatever arousal is produced by office supplies</italic>. <italic>Is the emotional state the object of interest or the social aspect? None of the other stimuli were arousing. Is it possible that the authors have shown that emotional arousal increases theta power in some areas?</italic></p><p>The point with the objects is exactly that they are not arousing and still elicit a similar investigative behavior, as well as habituation and dishabituation, as the social stimuli. Thus, the objects control for the possibility that the theta is not induced by arousal. We now added the fear conditioning experiments, showing that social and fear stimuli, both causing arousal states, yield very different changes in theta rhythmicity and theta coherence in the same network. Thus, the theta rhythmicity differentially reflects distinct arousal states caused by social and fearful stimuli.</p><p><italic>10) The authors fail to cite a long literature showing that AOB /MOB theta is a respiratory rhythm which is independent of the olfactory respiratory rhythm.

Briefly, there is no reason to record the sniffing in our case, first because it was previously done with similar paradigms and second because the sniffing cycle itself is known to be modulated by the arousal state and even by expectation to reward. Therefore, it is almost impossible to disconnect the sniffing from the loop. Moreover, the sniffing cycle is probably involved in the entrainment of the OB theta and this may be the reason for the high coherence between the AOB and MOB. However, it cannot be generating the theta of the higher brain centers because of the low coherence between the OB and these centers. This was shown by several papers regarding the hippocampal theta rhythm.</p><p><italic>2) Does TP return to baseline prior to the next social stimulus? These data do not seem to be presented.

How exactly theta rhythmicity coordinate neural activity is a general and complex issue that was dealt in may review papers, some of which are cited by us (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsaki and Draguhn, 2004</xref>) and is out of the scope of this paper. Our coherence data indeed suggest that such coordination is dynamic and may change its pattern in different contexts. In times when the regions recorded by us are not synchronized among themselves, they may be synchronized with other relevant regions. We suggest that such dynamics may be crucial for the enhancement of certain cognitive processes, such as memorization of specific stimuli, in distinct neuronal networks according to their value (social or fearful) and saliency (novel or familiar).</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The addition of the fear conditioning group is a very nice addition to this study and really addresses the arousal issue that so concerned the reviewers in the previous version.
