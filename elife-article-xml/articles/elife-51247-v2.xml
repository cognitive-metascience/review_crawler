involved in peptidoglycan (PG) remodeling. However, their contribution to cell-wall-modifying complexes and their potential as antimicrobial drug targets remains unclear. Here, we determined a high-resolution structure of the LT, an outer membrane lipoprotein from <italic>Neisseria</italic> species with a disordered active site helix (alpha helix 30). We show that deletion of the conserved alpha-helix 30 interferes with the integrity of the cell wall, disrupts cell division, cell separation, and impairs the fitness of the human pathogen <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> during infection. Additionally, deletion of alpha-helix 30 results in hyperacetylated PG, suggesting this LtgA variant affects the function of the PG de-<italic>O-</italic>acetylase (Ape 1). Our study revealed that Ape 1 requires LtgA for optimal function, demonstrating that LTs can modulate the activity of their protein-binding partner. We show that targeting specific domains in LTs can be lethal, which opens the possibility that LTs are useful drug-targets.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria are surrounded by a tough yet flexible wall that protects the cell and serves as an anchor for several of the cell’s structures. This cell wall contains a large mesh-like molecule called peptidoglycan made of many repeated building blocks. When a bacterial cell divides in two, it needs to make more of this material. Making peptidoglycan involves two different sets of enzymes working together: “polymerases” are the enzymes that link the individual building blocks to peptidoglycan, one after the other; while “lytic transglycosylases” are enzymes that modify the peptidoglycan to create space for the addition of new building blocks and for assemblies of proteins that must span the cell wall.</p><p>Lytic transglycosylases are known to assemble with other proteins and enzymes to form the cell’s peptidoglycan-modifying machinery, but it was not clear exactly what purpose they serve within these “enzyme complexes”. It was also unclear whether these enzymes would be good targets for new antibiotics.</p><p>To help answer these questions, Williams et al. looked at a lytic transglycoslyase called LtgA. This enzyme is originally from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, a bacterium that can cause meningitis and life-threatening sepsis in humans. Williams et al. discovered that part of the enzyme’s active site – the region of an enzyme where the chemical reaction takes – can switch from an ordered helix to a disordered, flexible loop. Bacteria were then genetically engineered to make a version of the enzyme that lacked this helix. These bacteria had weaker cell walls and were deformed; they were also less able to grow and divide, both in the laboratory and in a mouse model of infection. Further analysis showed that the deletion of the helix from the enzyme resulted in the peptidoglycan being modified much more than normal, which could likely explain their reduced virulence.</p><p>Williams et al. also found that deleting the helix from LtgA interfered with the activity of a protein that interacts with this enzyme, called Ape1, which also contributed to the fragility of the cell wall. This shows that lytic transglycosylases assembled into enzyme complexes can alter the activities of other proteins in the complex.</p><p>Together these findings show that researchers could target one enzyme in a complex in bacteria, and disrupt the activity of other proteins in that complex. This highlights the possibility of considering enzyme complexes as useful targets for new drugs, which is important considering the current problem of antibiotic resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic></kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>Lytic transglycosylase</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>cell separation</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 732-2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Allison Hillary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PGN from SHAPE to VIR 202283</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gomperts Boneca</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBF20160635726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gomperts Boneca</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut Carnot-Pasteur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Maladies Infectious fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Allison Hillary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut Carnot Pasteur Microbes and Sante</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santecchia</surname><given-names>Ignacio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDT201805005258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santecchia</surname><given-names>Ignacio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lytic transglycosylase enhances the activity of its protein partner, and its catalytic domain can be targeted to disrupt cell-wall integrity, protein partner function, and bacterial survival (<italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>) in hosts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lytic transglycosylases (LTs) degrade peptidoglycan (PG) to produce <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)−1,6-anhydro-<italic>N</italic>-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc)-peptide (G-anhM-peptide), a key cytotoxic elicitor of harmful innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Viala et al., 2004</xref>). LTs have been classified into four distinct families based on sequence similarities and consensus sequences. LTs belonging to family 1 of the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 23 share sequence similarity with the goose-type lysozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackburn and Clarke, 2001</xref>). Family 1 can be further subdivided into five subfamilies, 1A through E, which are all structurally distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackburn and Clarke, 2001</xref>). Despite the overall structural differences among LTs, their active sites, enzymatic activities and substrate specificities are fairly well conserved.</p><p>The crystal structure of the outer membrane lipoprotein LtgA, a homolog of Slt70 that belongs to family 1A of GH family 23 from the pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> species, was previously determined at a resolution of 1.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Williams et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Williams et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, LtgA is a highly alpha-superhelical structure consisting of 37 alpha helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Although LTs have very diverse overall secondary structures, they exhibit similar substrate specificities and a preference for PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). LtgA shares an overall weak sequence similarity with Slt70 (25%). However, the structural and sequence alignments of the catalytic domains of Slt70 and LtgA revealed absolute active site conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Williams et al., 2018</xref>). The active site of LtgA is formed by ten alpha helices (α 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37), with a six-alphahelix bundle (α 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34) constituting the core of the active site that firmly secures the glycan chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular architecture of LtgA alpha helix 30 and contacts made with reaction.</title><p>intermediates.

In our recent study, active LtgA was monitored for the first time in the crystalline state, and the residues involved in the substrate and product formation steps were identified. Globally, conformational changes occurred in three domains, the U, C and L domains, between native LtgA and LtgA bound to the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Williams et al., 2018</xref>). Substantial conformational changes were observed in the active site, for example, during the product formation step, the active site adopted a more open conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Williams et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Many Gram-negative bacteria have multiple and redundant LTs; for example, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has eight (MltA, MltB, MltC, MltD, MltE, MltF, MltG and Slt70), and <italic>Neisseria</italic> species encode 5 (LtgA, LtgB, LtgC, LtgD, and LtgE). Because the activity of LTs is redundant, the loss of one or more LTs in <italic>E. coli</italic> leads to no observable growth defects. When genes for six LTs were deleted from <italic>E. coli</italic>, a mild chaining phenotype was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heidrich et al., 2002</xref>). However, despite lack of strong observable phenotypic changes, it has been suggested that LTs may have well-defined roles in the cell. For example, the deletion of <italic>ltgA</italic> and <italic>ltgD</italic> in <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> eliminates the release of cytotoxic PG monomers suggesting the activities of LtgA and LtgD are redundant. Moreover, LtgA primarily localizes at the septum, indicating a role in the divisome machinery, whereas LtgD is distributed along the entire cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schaub et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The activities of LTs are known to be inhibited by β-hexosaminidase inhibitors (for example, NAG-thiazoline); by bulgecins A, B and C; and by PG-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Williams et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reid et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Templin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tomoshige et al., 2018</xref>).

Most notable are the interactions between Slt70 and PBPs 1b, 1c, 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Rechenberg et al., 1996</xref>). PBPs are essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis and are required for proliferation, cell division and the maintenance of the bacterial cell structure. Previously, PBPs were thought to be primarily responsible for the polymerization of PG. Recently, RodA, a key member of the elongasome, and a shape, elongation, division and sporulation (SEDS) protein family member was shown to be a PG polymerase. RodA functions together with PBP2 to replicate the transglycosylase and transpeptidase activities found in bifunctional PBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meeske et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sjodt et al., 2018</xref>). SEDS proteins are widely distributed in bacteria and are important in both the cell elongation and division machinery. <italic>Neisseria</italic> species such as <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> are coccoid in shape and lack an elongation machinery. Therefore, these species incorporate new PG through complex interactions in the divisome. Both <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> have five PBPs, namely, PBP1, PBP2, PBP3, PBP4 and PBP5. PBP1 and PBP2 are homologous to <italic>E. coli</italic> PBP1a and PBP3, while the <italic>Neisseria</italic> PBP3 and PBP4 are homologous to <italic>E. coli</italic> PBP4 and PBP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sauvage et al., 2008</xref>). PBP5 in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Neisseria</italic> species are both predicted carboxypeptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zarantonelli et al., 2013</xref>). FtsW, a RodA homolog and a key component of the divisome machinery, forms a complex with FtsI (PBP3). The FtsW-PBP3 complex shares similar interacting regions with the RodA-PBP2 complex, and is the confirmed PG polymerase of the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taguchi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Previous work by our group and others have demonstrated that PBPs and LTs can be targeted in a combined antibiotic regimen that could counter antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonis et al., 2012</xref>), highlighting the possibility of simultaneously inhibiting LTs and their binding partners, such as PBPs, to achieve a synergistic antibiotic effect. Here, we reveal the near-atomic-resolution crystal structure of a native version of LtgA with a disordered active site alpha helix. When LtgA, missing the alpha helix 30 motif, was expressed from an ectopic locus in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> (at an elevated level compared to wild type), bacterial growth, cell division and daughter cell separation were disrupted, compromising the integrity of the cell wall and PG composition, and diminishing bacterial fitness or virulence in a mouse infection model. It is known that LTs exist in multi-protein complexes. Here, we demonstrate that LTs can enhance the activity of one of their protein-binding partners thus ascribing a new role to LTs in the PG degrading machinery. This study demonstrates that despite the redundancy of LTs, they can be useful potential targets for future antibiotic development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of LtgA with a disordered alpha helix 30</title><p>In the course of monitoring the LtgA reaction in the crystalline state, we captured a native version of LtgA with a distinctly disordered alpha helix 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

One potential solution is to develop new treatment strategies that impact multiple cellular targets and consequently, circumvent the rise of antibiotic resistance. The bacterial cell wall is assembled by a number of enzymes, some of which are broadly categorized as PG polymerases, PG-modifying enzymes and PG hydrolases. The primary targets of β-lactams, clinically the most utilized antibiotics, are PBPs that are known to polymerize PG. The development of a combinatorial or single therapy that interferes with multiple cellular function of the PG machinery could define a new era in antibiotic development. This would be particularly relevant for <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> infections, as no vaccines against this species are currently available, and highly resistant strains are on the rise. Indeed, a <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> ‘superbug’ has already been identified that does not respond to the usual treatment with β-lactams such as ceftriaxone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suay-García and Pérez-Gracia, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identified a variant of LtgA with a disordered active site alpha helix 30, which is important for PG binding and for the catalytic mechanism of LtgA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). LTs are highly redundant enzymes, and when individual or multiple LTs are deleted, bacteria are known to proliferate normally because others LTs compensate for the loss of activity and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cloud and Dillard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, when 6 LTs were deleted from <italic>E. coli</italic>, only a mild chaining phenotype was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heidrich et al., 2002</xref>); however, a mutant of <italic>ltgC</italic> with a 33 bp deletion at the 5′ end from <italic>Neisseria</italic> sp., showed defects in growth and daughter cell separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cloud and Dillard, 2004</xref>). In our <italic>ΔltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic><sup>Δ30</sup> strain, we observed significant defects in growth, cell division, cell separation, cell membrane irregularities, and fibrous and membranous extra cellular material, which were noticeably absent in the wild type, <italic>ΔltgA,</italic> and the Δ<italic>ltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). LtgA has been shown to localize to the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schaub et al., 2016</xref>), but no phenotype associated with cell division or cell separation was previously reported. However, the expression of an LT with impaired function (LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup>) results in the perturbation of various processes that are essential for bacterial proliferation.</p><p>Having observed that the <italic>ΔltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic><sup>Δ30</sup> strain, but not the <italic>ΔltgA</italic> strain, was defective in growth, cell separation, and cell division, we then analyzed the PG profiles of wild-type <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, Δ<italic>ltgA</italic>, Δ<italic>ltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic> and Δ<italic>ltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic><sup>Δ30</sup>, and observed that Δ<italic>ltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic><sup>Δ30</sup> strain was hyperacetylated and there was an increase in PG monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Since the hyperacetylation of the PG was the most striking phenotype, we analyzed the functional relationship between LtgA and Ape1. The interaction between LtgA and Ape1 was not unexpected because Ape1, a PG-de-<italic>O</italic>-acetylase, removes the <italic>O</italic>-acetyl group from the C6-hydroxyl position of the glycan strand of <italic>O</italic>-acetylated PG and ensures the continued metabolism of the PG by LTs (LtgA, LtgD or LtgE and others) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weadge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weadge and Clarke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfeffer and Clarke, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veyrier et al., 2013</xref>). Based on the hyperacetylation of the PG, we hypothesized that a functional LtgA is needed to stablize the activity of Ape1 and together they work in concert to ensure the proper metabolism of the PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–c</xref>). To test this, we used 4-nitrophenyl acetate, a known substrate of Ape1 but not LtgA. Surprisingly, LtgA enhances the activity and function of Ape1 well past the normal range (1 hr) of most in vitro enzymatic reactions, giving clear evidence that LtgA could orchestrate the activity, and function of Ape1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–c</xref>). Since Ape1 and LtgA activity appears to be synergistic, we examined whether the abberant phenotype of the <italic>ΔltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic><sup>Δ30</sup> strain could be related to the malfunction of Ape1. Similar to the <italic>ΔltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic><sup>Δ30</sup> strain, the <italic>Δape1 strain</italic> showed clear cell membrane irregularities; however, there were no significant defects in cell division or separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The observed cell membrane irregularities of the <italic>ΔltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic><sup>Δ30</sup> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) could be due to the malfunction of Ape1, and defects in cell division or separation could be linked to a dysfunctional LtgA. A recent study showed that in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, LTs RlpA and MltC similar to LtgA both localize to the septum and contribute to daughter cell separation suggesting that during septal PG synthesis glycan strands are formed between daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our study revealed an intimate relationship between LtgA and Ape1, ie. LtgA enhances the activity of Ape1 and an impaired LtgA results in a dysfunctional Ape1, and appears to poison the cell wall machinery with devastating effects toward the survival of <italic>Neisseria in the host</italic>.</p><p>Finally, to understand what role a defective LtgA that interferes with the normal function of the PG machinery plays in the pathogenesis of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, we used a mouse infection model and showed Δ<italic>ltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic><sup>Δ30</sup> strain of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> was cleared from the blood at a significantly faster rate than the wild-type, Δ<italic>ltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic> or Δ<italic>ltgA</italic> strains. Consistent with the virulence phenotype, and in comparison to the other three strains, the Δ<italic>ltgA<sup>ltgA</sup></italic><sup>Δ30</sup> strain in mice resulted in significantly decreased levels of IL-6 and KC, and decreased bacterial load in the blood at 6 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–b</xref>), indicating a loss of fitness of the helix-30 deleted mutant strain in the host.</p><p>One possible explanation for the differences in bacterial load after 6 hr in the helix-30 deleted strain is bacterial clearance mediated by the complement system. It is well accepted that <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> is eliminated from the blood through complement lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2007</xref>). Generally, individuals with complement lysis difficiencies are at a higher risk for invasive meningococcal disease. Additionally, the helix deleted strain is hyperacetyaled and it is known that modification of the PG makes the cell wall more susceptible to complement-mediated lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zarantonelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosain et al., 2017</xref>), and PG modification is also associated with a decreased inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taguchi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In summary, Ape1’s activity is enhanced by LtgA. An impaired LtgA disrupts the function of Ape1, the normal course of bacterial cell division or cell separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a-c</xref>), paving the way for the design of inhibitors or antibiotics that target LTs.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Peptidoglycan degrading complexes can modulate enzymatic function.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The removal of the <italic>O</italic>-acetyl group by Ape1 allows LtgA to efficiently metabolize the PG.

Additionally, as we discovered with Ape1, LTs can regulate the function and activity of their protein binding partners, revealing an additional role for LTs in the bacterium . This study shows the ripple effects of disrupting LtgA PG binding capabilities and sets the stage for future development of a class of antibiotics that may act by a dual action in vivo.

In this backdrop, bacterial peptidoglycan remains a tractable area for new drug development given the proven clinical benefit of drugs that target this macromolecule. This study, which describes how an alpha helix from the peptidoglycan remodelling enzyme, LtgA, can modulate cell wall stability highlights how the careful coordination of cell wall assembly and hydrolysis can be targeted by modulating the activity of hydrolases that remodel the cell surface. The conservation of similar motifs or regulatory patterns across different species suggests that this approach can be used to identify new drug targets in several bacterial pathogens.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers highlighted some interesting aspects of your work, chief among which included some novel insight on the function of LtgA, based on structure-function associations. However, there were notable concerns regards the lack of sufficient data to support the conclusions regarding the role of LtgA in coordinating peptidoglycan hydrolysis. Further, the focus of the paper did not seem to fit with the data presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Peptidoglycan (PG), a biopolymer made up of cross-linked sugars and stem peptides, is a widely distributed component of bacterial cell walls. Remodelling of this polymer requires the concerted action of a variety of PG synthesising and hydrolysing enzymes. Lytic transglycosylases are a family of PG hydrolases that break down the glycan component. These enzymes usually occur in bacteria in genetic redundancy. In their submission, Williams and colleagues describe the function of LtgA, a lytic transglycosylase, in <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>. They build on previous findings that describe the crystal structure of this protein and describe a role for LtgA in regulating divisome function and virulence.</p><p>Key findings:</p><p>1) The description of an atomic structure of LtgA with a disordered alpha helix 30, which is involved in clamping the glycan strand during catalysis. Mutation of this helix decreases the affinity of the protein for PG.</p><p>2) Deletion of helix 30 affected growth of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, this was associated with cell division and morphological defects?</p><p>3) Removal of this helix also results in hyperacetylation of the peptidoglycan.</p><p>4) LtgA interacts with ApeI (a peptidoglycan-de-<italic>O</italic>-acetylase) and PBP1a (a high molecular weight penicillin binding protein).</p><p>5) LtgA and ApeI appear to enhance each other's function in a reciprocal manner.</p><p>6) Removal of helix 30 attenuated <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> for colonization of mice – as measured by bacteraemia in the blood – and altered induction of IL-16 and KC.</p><p>Conclusion: LtgA forms an important component of the divisome and regulates the function of other PG modifying enzymes.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The morphological defects in Figure 1 need to be quantified, followed by a statistical comparison to wild type and the <italic>ltgA</italic> complement derivatives. How many cells had these observations? How many ghost cells were observed?</p><p>2) Figure 7 needs statistics for the cytokines.</p><p>3) IL-6 is proinflammatory cytokine, in most cases. The LtgA helix 30 mutant has reduced production of IL-6 (Figure 7). In this context, the statement in the Discussion (paragraph seven) that this mutant version of LtgA has pro-inflammatory potential does not make sense. The mouse phenotypes are somewhat unclear – reduced inflammation but longer persistence of the helix 30 mutant. There is a lot of conjecture in the discussion – but little evidence to substantiate the claims made.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript entitled, &quot;Crippling the bacterial cell wall molecular machinery&quot;. by Williams et al. describes the function of a truncation mutant in LtgA that removes alpha helix 30. While the finding may eventually turn out interesting, but at this point the inconsistencies and poor quality of the writing makes it impossible to fully understand the work. For example, the authors describe a number of proteins that bind the Δ30 protein, but not the wildtype protein, based on Figure 5. However, they go on to validate the binding of these proteins to the wildtype LtgA in Figure 6 not the mutant. They also claim that the Δ30 strain was cleared faster in mice, but they don't account for the slower growth rate of this crippled strain. There are many other problems with the work that needs to be ironed out before this could be considered for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper by Williams and colleagues follows up on a previous study that reported the structure of the lytic transglycosylase (LT) LtgA from <italic>Neisseria</italic> species. LT enzymes cut bonds in the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall layer, but their precise role(s) in the overall process of PG biogenesis have remained elusive. Here, the authors report a variant of the LtgA structure in which an alpha-helix in the active site (H30) is disordered. It is thought that this structure may represent an intermediate in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. To further investigate the importance of H30 for LtgA function, a variant of the enzyme with H30 deleted (LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup>) is constructed and expressed in a <italic>Neisseria</italic> strain deleted for the native <italic>ltgA</italic> gene. Surprisingly, while the loss of LtgA function causes little to no phenotype, expression of LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> causes a severe growth defect and major problems with cell division/separation. Cells producing LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> are found to contain elevated levels of acetylation in the PG sugars. They are also defective in pathogenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by proteomics was performed to identify interaction partners of LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> and LtgA (wild type). Although there were no significant hits for LtgA (wild type), LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> associated with other factors involved in PG biogenesis. in vitro studies were performed to show that LtgA (wild type) can interact with some of the factors identified in the proteomic study. Another factor Ape1, a PG deacetylase, was also shown to interact with LtgA (wild type) in vitro, but the interaction was not observed in the proteomic analysis. Finally, LtgA (wild type) was shown to enhance the deacetylase activity of Ape1.</p><p>From the results of these experiments the authors conclude that LtgA mediates the function of a hub of PG glycan strand modifying enzymes, orchestrates cell division, cell wall integrity, and contributes to pathogenicity. Although there are several interesting aspects to this study, most of these stated conclusions are not justified by the data. I believe the authors should carefully reconsider their interpretation of the results and consider changing the focus of the manuscript to the Ape1-LtgA connection.</p><p>My major concerns are as follows:</p><p>1) The observation that deletion of <italic>ltgA</italic> has no phenotype but that LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup>expression is detrimental to growth indicates that a defective LtgA is worse than not having it at all. One cannot conclude from this observation that LtgA orchestrates cell division, cell wall integrity, or the function of an important enzymatic complex. If this were true, then the loss of <italic>ltgA</italic> function would result in division and cell wall defects. The more likely explanation of the results is that the catalytically defective LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> binds glycans and/or components of the PG biogenesis machinery and somehow impairs their function. Thus, the finding that LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> expression is detrimental provides a clue to LtgA function, but more information about the mechanism behind the dominant-negative phenotype is needed to make strong statements/conclusions about LtgA's role in the cell. At present, it is hard to tell whether or not the detrimental effects of LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> production has anything to do with its normal function, especially since it is expressed at about 3-5x greater concentration than the native enzyme in the reported experiments.</p><p>2) I think it is important to know whether an active site point mutant of LtgA has a similar phenotype to LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup>. This will help determine whether LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> is special in some way, or if any catalytically defective enzyme will cause similar effects on cell division etc.</p><p>3) The observation that LtgA interacts with PBP1a and LtgE in vitro is interesting. However, none of the results indicate that these interactions have a functional consequence in cells or on the enzymes in vitro. Thus, the conclusion that LtgA mediates the function of a hub of PG glycan strand modifying enzymes is not an appropriate one to make without further studies.</p><p>Given that LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> expression affects PG acetylation in cells and LtgA promotes the activity of the deacetylase Ape1 in vitro, there is a much more convincing functional connection between these enzymes. I would therefore recommend rewriting the paper to focus on the dominant negative phenotype of LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> and potentially other catalytically defective LtgA variants and how this uncovered a connection with Ape1 function.</p><p>4) There is a disconnect between the co-immunoprecipitation/proteomic results and the in vitro SEC experiments. The co-IP data indicate that only LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> associates with PBP1a and other proteins, yet the SEC experiments are performed with LtgA (wild type). If the LtgA (wild type) is capable of interacting with these proteins, why did they not show up as hits in the proteomic analysis? Does LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> have a greater affinity for the interaction partners identified? This discrepancy raises concerns about the validity and reproducibility of the proteomic experiments.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Crippling the bacterial cell wall molecular machinery&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Please note that while we are asking for a substantial number of items to be addressed, we remain overall positive about the work, and are of the opinion that this all very doable within a reasonable time frame.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The revised manuscript from Williams and colleague describes the role of the helix 30 structural motif in LtgA, a lytic transglycosylase from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>. Expression of a variant from of LtgA, with the helix 30 deleted, resulted in altered cell wall stability, defective cell separation, reduced virulence and hyperacetylated peptidoglycan. The authors conclude that expression of this defective version of LtgA modulates the function of the peptidoglycan de-<italic>O</italic>-acetylase, Ape1. Whilst some of the issue raised during the first round of review have been addressed, the following issues need attention for the manuscript to be considered further at <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>Major issues requiring new experimentation:</p><p>1). The focus on the LtgA-Ape1 connection in the revised manuscript represents a major step in the right direction. However, with this renewed focus, it becomes important to provide some data that helps explain why Ape1 activity appears to be negatively impacted by expression of the LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> mutant. At a minimum, Ape1 levels should be assessed by western blot to determine whether or not it is stably expressed in these cells.</p><p>2) Additional support for the model that Ape1 is activated by LtgA in vivo should also be provided by examining whether or not Ape1 depletion results in a morphological defect that resembles that induced by the LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> mutant.</p><p>3) Testing whether or not expression of a catalytically defective LtgA mutant induces the same phenotype as the LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> mutant is an important experiment. It will indicate whether or not there is something special about the LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> mutant or if any catalytic defect will cause the observed effects. This experiment is not a difficult one, and given its importance, is not beyond the scope of the current manuscript or a subject for further study.</p><p>4) The title of the manuscript is too vague and does not convey any useful information to a potential reader. Consider something sharper and more on-point such as, &quot;A catalytically defective variant of a lytic transglycosylase disrupts cell morphogenesis by interfering with peptidoglycan deacetylation in Neisseria meningitidis&quot;. Or something similar to this effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51247.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Based on structural knowledge we demonstrate how an LT (LtgA) can be manipulated to affect the integrity of the cell wall composition, create a defect in cell division and separation, and can be manipulated to impair the fitness of the human pathogen <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> during infection. Our study shows that targeting LTs disrupts the function of its binding partner Ape1 whose stability and activity depends on LtgA. We demonstrate in this verified case, that besides degrading the PG, peptidoglycan degrading enzyme complexes can modulate their enzyme function and stability. These findings highlight the importance of these PG complexes in <italic>Neisseria</italic> biology and virulence, demonstrating their potential as future targets for drug development.</p><p>2) We are sorry that it was unclear, and we have taken significant steps to revise the manuscript both in focus and discussion. The revised paper is more focused and easier to read. It is now primarily focused on LtgA and Ape1 which has shortened the manuscript and improved the overall clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, the authors describe a number of proteins that bind the Δ30 protein, but not the wildtype protein, based on Figure 5.

We apologize if this was unclear however the purpose of this experiment was misunderstood because it was not communicated effectively in our original draft of our paper. Therefore, we will explain in more detail below:</p><p>In our manuscript we used the Label-free mass spectrometry developed by Mathias Mann (PMID: 25363814). We utilized two quantification strategies: (1) spectral counting and (2) spectrometric signal intensity to measure the protein expression.</p><p>All samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry separately using the same protocol. The proteins from each sample were identified using two strategies: 1) the protein expression from each sample is estimated using the number of MS/MS spectra identifying peptide of the protein and 2) the intensity of the corresponding MS spectrum features of the protein. Our output is the list of detected proteins and the absolute or relative abundance of the proteins across all samples for each experimental run, which was done in triplicates. I would like to emphasize that the mass spectrometry can only identify enriched peptides in one sample versus another. It does not tell you whether proteins are absolutely interacting directly or whether all peptides belonging to every single protein was identified, however it can be utilized to define the molecular environment of the protein of interest. For example, in both the wild-type and the delta helix strain PBP1a, LtgE, LtgD were identified but they were more enriched in the delta helix strain. In contrast, Ape1 peptides were not identified by mass spec in either strain which could be because of the abundance of Ape1 in the bacteria or some other technical issue.</p><p>Finally, we realize that the mass spectrometry and validation experiments of the LtgA interactome broadens the story and therefore based on suggestions from reviewer 3 we have refocused the manuscripts on LtgA and Ape1. The proteomic experiments have been moved to the supplementary and its limitation and precise utility discussed briefly in the main text. We apologize again for this confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They also claim that the Δ30 strain was cleared faster in mice, but they don't account for the slower growth rate of this crippled strain.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize there was no detail explanation in the text.

[…] Additionally, the helix deleted strain is hyperacetyaled and it is known that modification of the PG makes the cell wall more susceptible to complement-mediated lysis (Zarantonelli et al., 2013; Rosain et al., 2017), and PG modification is also associated with a decreased inflammatory response (Taguchi et al.,2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are many other problems with the work that needs to be ironed out before this could be considered for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for your critic.

Thus, the finding that LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> expression is detrimental provides a clue to LtgA function, but more information about the mechanism behind the dominant-negative phenotype is needed to make strong statements/conclusions about LtgA's role in the cell. At present, it is hard to tell whether or not the detrimental effects of LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> production has anything to do with its normal function, especially since it is expressed at about 3-5x greater concentration than the native enzyme in the reported experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. We have changed the sentence in the Abstract to read:</p><p>“Here we show, that the active site of LtgA can be genetically modified to, affect the integrity of the cell wall, cell division, cell separation, and can impair the fitness of the human pathogen <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> during infection.”</p><p>We apologize if this was unclear however, LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> is produced relative to the wild type or the complemented strains at roughly 2 times greater amounts. Please see the exact quantification in Figure 2B and C. However, we agree and appreciate your point about the precision of the statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I think it is important to know whether an active site point mutant of LtgA has a similar phenotype to LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup>. This will help determine whether LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> is special in some way, or if any catalytically defective enzyme will cause similar effects on cell division etc.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point, however the mutant we created is defective in substrate binding and therefore could affect the ability of the LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> mutant catalyze efficiently the PG. However, this would be a part of a future more extensive exploration.</p><p><italic>3) The observation that LtgA interacts with PBP1a and LtgE</italic> in vitro <italic>is interesting. However, none of the results indicate that these interactions have a functional consequence in cells or on the enzymes</italic> in vitro<italic>. Thus, the conclusion that LtgA mediates the function of a hub of PG glycan strand modifying enzymes is not an appropriate one to make without further studies.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is correct. As pointed out above in the revised version we have removed this statement from the manuscript. Additionally, primarily based on your suggestion we have further refocused the paper on Ape1 and LtgA.</p><p><italic>Given that LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> expression affects PG acetylation in cells and LtgA promotes the activity of the deacetylase Ape1</italic> in vitro<italic>, there is a much more convincing functional connection between these enzymes. I would therefore recommend rewriting the paper to focus on the dominant negative phenotype of LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> and potentially other catalytically defective LtgA variants and how this uncovered a connection with Ape1 function.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this very important insight, and we have revised the manuscript to focus on these two main players Ape1 and LtgA.</p><p><italic>4) There is a disconnect between the co-immunoprecipitation/proteomic results and the</italic> in vitro <italic>SEC experiments. The co-IP data indicate that only LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> associates with PBP1a and other proteins, yet the SEC experiments are performed with LtgA (wild type). If the LtgA (wild type) is capable of interacting with these proteins, why did they not show up as hits in the proteomic analysis? Does LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> have a greater affinity for the interaction partners identified? This discrepancy raises concerns about the validity and reproducibility of the proteomic experiments.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We apologize if this was unclear however, since the purpose of this experiment was largely misunderstood, because it was not communicated effectively in our original draft of our paper. We will explain below:</p><p>In our manuscript we used the Label-free mass spectrometry developed by Mathias Mann (PMID: 25363814). We utilized two quantification strategies: (1) spectral counting and (2) spectrometric signal intensity to measure the protein expression. All samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry separately using the same protocol. The proteins from each sample were identified using two strategies: 1) the protein expression from each sample is estimated using the number of MS/MS spectra identifying peptide of the protein and 2) the intensity of the corresponding MS spectrum features of the protein. Our output is the list of detected proteins and the absolute or relative abundance of the proteins across all samples for each experimental run, which was done in triplicates. I would like to emphasize that the mass spectrometry can only identify enriched peptides in one sample versus another. It does not tell you whether proteins are absolutely interacting directly or whether all peptides belonging to every single protein was identified, however it can be utilized to define the molecular environment of the protein of interest. For example, in both the wild-type and the delta helix strain PBP1a, LtgE, LtgD were identified but they were more enriched in the delta helix strain. In contrast, Ape1 peptides were not identified by mass spec in either strain which could be because of the abundance of Ape1 in the bacteria or some other technical issue.</p><p>We acknowledge that the Mass spec and validation experiments of the LtgA interactome broadens the story and therefore based on your suggestions we have further refocused the manuscripts on LtgA and Ape1. The proteomic experiments have been moved to the supplementary and its limitation and precise utility discussed briefly in the main text.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major issues requiring new experimentation:</p><p>1). The focus on the LtgA-Ape1 connection in the revised manuscript represents a major step in the right direction. However, with this renewed focus, it becomes important to provide some data that helps explain why Ape1 activity appears to be negatively impacted by expression of the LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> mutant. At a minimum, Ape1 levels should be assessed by western blot to determine whether or not it is stably expressed in these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important insight. Ape1 is produced comparatively across each strain. Please see Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><p><italic>2) Additional support for the model that Ape1 is activated by LtgA</italic> in vivo <italic>should also be provided by examining whether or not Ape1 depletion results in a morphological defect that resembles that induced by the LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> mutant.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. In our previous study we did note that a knockout of Ape1 resulted in the increased cell size of <italic>Neissera meningitidis (</italic>Veyrier et al. 2013). Here we examine the <italic>Δape1</italic> strain for morphological defects using SEM or labeling the cell wall with FM-64. While there were no pronounced differences in the division and separation, we did find significant cell shape abnormalities and lysed bacteria i.e. irregular cell surfaces, high molecular weight blebs, asymmetrical diplococci, and lysed bacteria Please see Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Testing whether or not expression of a catalytically defective LtgA mutant induces the same phenotype as the LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> mutant is an important experiment. It will indicate whether or not there is something special about the LtgA<sup>Δ30</sup> mutant or if any catalytic defect will cause the observed effects. This experiment is not a difficult one, and given its importance, is not beyond the scope of the current manuscript or a subject for further study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. A mutant of the catalytic residue did not result in any observable phenotype. Please see Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The title of the manuscript is too vague and does not convey any useful information to a potential reader. Consider something sharper and more on-point such as, &quot;A catalytically defective variant of a lytic transglycosylase disrupts cell morphogenesis by interfering with peptidoglycan deacetylation in Neisseria meningitidis&quot;. Or something similar to this effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We loved your suggestion. However, it was too long based on the character limit from eLife. So we revised it to: “A defective lytic transglycosylase disrupts cell morphogenesis by hindering peptidoglycan de-O-acetylation in meningococcus.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
