Through recombination and mutation of small numbers of genes, Igs can specifically recognize a vast variety of natural and man-made organic molecules. Jawless vertebrates evolved a parallel system of humoral immunity, which recognizes antigens not with Ig, but with a structurally unrelated receptor called the variable lymphocyte receptor B (VLRB). We exploited the convergent evolution of Ig and VLRB antibodies (Abs) to investigate if intrinsic chemical features of foreign proteins determine their antigenicity and immunogenicity. Surprisingly, we find lamprey VLRB and mouse Ig responses to influenza A virus are extremely similar. Each focuses ∼80% of the response on hemagglutinin (HA), mainly through recognition of the major antigenic sites in the HA globular head domain. Our findings predict basic conservation of Ab responses to protein antigens, strongly supporting the use of animal models for understanding human Ab responses to viruses and protein immunogens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07467.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07467.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07467.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Influenza viruses infect ten of millions of people each year. To conquer a flu infection, the human immune system develops antibodies that hasten recovery and prevent future flu infections. Unfortunately, flu is constantly changing in response to the human immune response, and antibodies induced by previous infection or vaccination provide partial protection, at best, against new strains.</p><p>An ideal flu vaccine would stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that protect against all future strains of influenza. Most human antibodies that are induced by influenza target a part of the virus called the hemagglutinin, which attaches the virus to cells to start a flu infection. Some hemagglutinin-specific antibodies recognize many strains of influenza, but individuals do not produce enough of these antibodies to prevent infections with new strains. A basic understanding of what drives the production of different types of antibodies is important to devise vaccines that produce broadly effective antibodies for flu and for other viruses and pathogens that have proven to be difficult vaccine targets.</p><p>To better understand the rules of antibody generation, Altman et al. compared antibodies produced in response to flu in mice and lampreys. Lampreys are a primitive fish that branched off from other vertebrates (animals with a backbone, like you) 550 million years ago and developed their own system of antibody recognition based on a completely different template. Despite this, Altman et al. found that the antibody response of mice and lampreys to flu is remarkably similar. Of several potential viral targets, antibodies from both mice and lampreys were predominantly directed against the hemagglutinin. Of numerous potential locations on the hemagglutinin, mouse and lamprey antibodies predominantly recognized the same region.</p><p>These similarities suggest that the specificity of antibodies is based largely on the properties of the virus, and varies little with the properties of the responding organism. Most importantly, this supports the conclusion that studies in mice and other mammals are likely to accurately predict how humans will respond to vaccines for viruses and other pathogens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07467.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07467.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>lamprey</kwd><kwd>immunodominance</kwd><kwd>antibodies</kwd><kwd>antigenicity</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>hemagglutinin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006492</institution-id><institution>Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Altman</surname><given-names>Meghan O</given-names></name><name><surname>Bennink</surname><given-names>Jack R</given-names></name><name><surname>Yewdell</surname><given-names>Jonathan W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI072435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herrin</surname><given-names>Brantley R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008065</institution-id><institution>Georgia Research Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM100151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herrin</surname><given-names>Brantley R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Antibody responses are remarkably similar in widely disparate hosts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A cornerstone of modern biology and medicine is that humans and other mammals generate a highly specific humoral immune response when confronted with microbes or toxins, providing the basis for vaccination against many pathogens. Originally defined as a functional principle (e.g., ability to protect animals against injection with a toxin), the responsible substance was termed an antibody (Ab), which we now know to consist of immunoglobulins (Igs) in jawed vertebrates. After more than a century of steady progress, a basic molecular understanding of Ig function is at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramaraj et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Georgiou et al., 2014</xref>); surprisingly little is known, however, regarding the basic rules of immunogenicity. In responding to viruses, why are some proteins more immunogenic than others? Why do Ig responses focus on certain regions of proteins? To what extent is this due to the specific features of Ig structure and combining site chemistry or repertoire limitations imposed by self-tolerance?</p><p>Here we address these issues by comparing the Ab responses of lampreys and mice to influenza A virus (IAV), a model antigen of high practical relevance. IAV is composed of four major structural proteins: two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), embedded in a lipid envelope, lined by the matrix protein (M1), which encases the nucleoprotein (NP) coated viral genome. Due to its importance as the target of protective Igs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Couch and Kasel, 1983</xref>), HA is probably the most intensively characterized immunogen/antigen. Most HA-specific Igs with virus neutralizing activity bind to or bridge 5 antigenic regions in the globular domain (termed Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2, and Cb), which surround the sialic acid receptor site that attaches HA to host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerhard et al., 1981</xref>). Variation in these sites as IAV evolves in the human population (‘antigenic drift’) prevents effective IAV vaccination, necessitating frequent changes in vaccine formulation. The recent discovery that humans can generate protective Igs to conserved structures in the membrane-proximal HA stem have raised hopes of more effective vaccination if stem responses can be augmented using appropriately designed vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Laursen and Wilson, 2013</xref>). Better understanding the rules of immunogenicity could inform these critical efforts.</p><p>We characterized the variable lymphocyte receptor B (VLRB) response of lampreys, which along with hagfish, are the only known living jawless vertebrates (cyclostomes). Cyclostomes branched evolutionarily from jawed vertebrates approximately 550 million years ago (Mya) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Pioneering studies from the Good laboratory established that lampreys generate Ab responses to protein and carbohydrate immunogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Finstad and Good, 1964</xref>). More than 40 years later, Cooper and colleagues discovered that lamprey Abs, VLRBs, bear no relationship to Igs, but rather are structurally similar to Toll-like receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pancer et al., 2004</xref>). In place of RAG-mediated V(D)J recombination, VLRB diversity is generated using a gene assembly mechanism reminiscent of the activation-induced cytidine deamine-catalyzed gene conversion mechanism used to diversify <italic>Ig</italic> genes in birds and some mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07467.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Origin of variable lymphocyte receptor B (VLRB) in jawless vertebrates.</title><p>Jawless and jawed vertebrates last shared a common ancestor ∼550 Mya. VLR genes are only in jawless vertebrates, whereas Immunoglobulin (Ig) genes are only in jawed vertebrates. However, both jawed and jawless vertebrates have a lymphocyte-based adaptive immune system suggesting that the genetic programs necessary for lymphocyte development originated in a common ancestor before the antigen receptor genes. Cytidine deaminases are expressed by lymphocytes in both jawed and jawless vertebrates and may have originated in a common ancestor; activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and cytosine deaminase (CDA).

This revealed that in both mice and lamprey, more than 90% of the functional ELISA response is specific for HA and NA, as shown by the large difference in titers between detergent soluble proteins from PR8 (H1N1) vs X31 (H3N2), a reassortant virus with the PR8 internal proteins but serologically distinct HK68 glycoproteins. Genetically isolating HA from NA using the J1 (H3N1, PR8 internal proteins) and P50 (H1N2, HK internal proteins) reassortants shows that upwards of 80% of ELISA-detected Abs are specific for HA in lamprey and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Low binding to X31 and HK soluble proteins, which contain significant amounts of M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicate that M1 is negligibly immunogenic (note that internal viral proteins from H3 and H1 viruses are antigenically highly conserved). Further, the low serum titers against PR8 cores confirm that only a small fraction of Igs are specific for NP or a low abundance internal virion component.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07467.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Immunodominance hierarchy against IAV for lamprey and mice is the same.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme depicting reassortant virus components used for experiments in this figure.

To compare Ig and VLRB footprints, we competed lamprey plasma against mouse monoclonal Abs (mAbs) specific for defined HA antigenic sites for binding to PR8-coated ELISA wells. Although IAV immunization elicited VLRB responses in all lampreys tested, we selected lampreys with the highest titers for the competition experiments because these experiments require larger amounts of VLRB. Comparing the relative titers of inhibitory activity provides an approximate measure of binding proximity. Such competition assays are complicated by steric hindrance between Abs binding physically adjacent epitopes as well as more subtle positive and negative conformational effects that occur upon Ig binding to HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lubeck and Gerhard, 1982</xref>).</p><p>Anti-PR8 plasma from lampreys 7 and 9 (L7, L9) competed with the mAbs tested, whereas neither naïve lamprey plasma nor mAbs to an irrelevant antigen competed with the mAbs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Table 2—source data 1</xref>). Also, while both L7 and L9 have a similar ELISA titer to whole virus, L9 plasma competes with mAbs specific for each of the five sites, but L7 fails to compete with Sa and Sb mAbs. This demonstrates that VLRB binding to the HA head does not uniformly block binding of all head-specific Igs and, importantly, indicates that fine antigen specificity varies among individual lampreys. We also infer this from the different titers observed against the various mAbs, an effect that is unlikely to be based on mAb affinity, since VLRBs are allowed to bind to HA prior to mAb addition.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07467.014</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>IC<sub>75</sub> values for anti-PR8 lamprey plasmas and guinea pig serum (positive control) in competition with defined HA mAbs by ELISA<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn3">*</xref></p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07467.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07467.014</ext-link></p><p><supplementary-material id="SD4-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07467.015</object-id><label>Table 2—source data 1.</label><caption><p>Competition ELISA against α-Head HA panel Abs.

L29 plasma did not, however, block binding of either a representative mouse or human mAb specific for the stem region with broadly neutralizing activity, suggesting that, as in mammals, the stem region is poorly immunogenic in lampreys (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Table 2—source data 3</xref>). Rather, as in man and mouse, the lamprey immune system focuses on the globular domain, and further, recognizes highly similar epitopes.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings support the conclusion that Ig and VLRB demonstrate similar specificity for HA head epitopes. Although steric issues limit interpretation of the competition experiments, the common effect of amino acid substitution on VLRB and Ig binding argues strongly for convergent recognition of highly overlapping epitopes. Equally surprising is the similarity of the overall immunodominance profile of IAV immunogens in mammals and lamprey responding to inactivated intact virus: the HA globular domain is favored over the stem; HA is favored over NA; and internal proteins, despite their relative abundance in the virion, are weakly (NP) or undetectably (M1) immunogenic.</p><p>Our findings extend understanding of the cyclostome VLRB response. We confirmed the Pancer group's finding that total plasma VLRB concentration increases after immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder et al., 2005</xref>). Total Ig can also increase in jawed fish after immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Castro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). This differs from mammals, where high levels are maintained constitutively. The ability of lampreys to respond to purified IAV without additional adjuvant indicates that lampreys recognize viral RNA or other viral innate immune activating molecules. We also show in competition assays that individual lampreys mount VLRB responses against different antigenic sites. Whether this is due to genetic, environmental, or stochastic factors is a question for further study. It is well worth noting that there is little information regarding how individuals among outbred groups vary in their Ig response to viruses or other complex antigens.</p><p>It is surprising that such structurally disparate molecules as Ig and VLRB receptors recognize the same proteins with overlapping epitopes. These recognition systems have evolved independently for &gt;500 Mya, presumably shaped by different selective pressures from the environment, self-tolerance, and microorganisms. These differences notwithstanding, the four available VLRB-antigen crystal structures reveal many similarities in Ig and VLRB antigen recognition.</p><p>In the two VLRB structures with protein antigens (hen egg lysozyme and anthrax coat protein, BclA), the contact area (∼1500 Å<sup>2</sup>) is in the same range as reported for Igs (1400–2300 Å<sup>2</sup>), and utilizes the same non-covalent forces (salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals contacts) in similar proportions to mediate binding, which requires close shape complementarity to the antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Velikovsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kirchdoerfer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2013</xref>). In the VLRB-HEL structure, the relatively small, crescent-shaped VLRB binds to an epitope in the catalytic cleft, whereas larger, dimeric Ig VHVL Abs bind to flatter epitopes away from the catalytic site. Interestingly, structures of single-chain camelid VHH and shark IgNAR have revealed that they also favor the catalytic cleft of HEL that is presumably sterically inaccessible to dimeric VHVL Abs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Velikovsky et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of hundreds of VLRB sequences has previously revealed a bias towards aromatic amino acids at the variable positions on the concave surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Velikovsky et al., 2009</xref>). In these analyses, less than half of the variable position residues contact antigen. When only the antigen <italic>contacting</italic> residue frequency is quantified, the amino acids are biased towards Tyr, Trp, Asn, and Asp residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). A similar bias towards these residues in antigen-contacting positions of Ig has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mian et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davies and Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramaraj et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Robin et al., 2014</xref>). These similarities may account for the recognition of similar epitopes. If so, this may also represent the optimal general solution for producing a single family of receptors capable of recognizing what is essentially an infinite array of antigens with high specificity and affinity.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07467.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Paratope signature of VLRBs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Contact residues determined by the crystal structures of VLRBs in complex with their antigens are highlighted in orange.

After an hour at 4°C, we washed the plates, and developed with anti-mouse HRP Ig and peroxidase substrate, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein gels and immunoblotting</title><p>We mixed purified IAV (0.5–4 µg protein) with 4× NuPage loading buffer (Invitrogen), with or without 4 mM DTT, and boiled for 15 min at 96°C. We electrophoresed samples with SeeBlue Plus2 ladder on 4–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) at 180 V for 90 min. To visualize proteins, we fixed gels for 10 min with 10 ml 10% acetic acid and 50% methanol, shaking at RT. After removing fixative we added 10 ml GelCode stain (Pierce) and shook for 30 min at room temperature, then destained the gels with water overnight. For immunoblotting, we transferred proteins from gels to PVDF membranes with the iBLOT at P3 setting for 7 min. We blocked membranes for 1 hr at room temperature with either 10% BSA in water for blots probed with lamprey plasma or with StartingBlock for mouse Abs (Thermo). After incubating with primary Ig or VLRB 1 hr at room temperature, washing 5× for 5 min each in TBST (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20), we added secondary and tertiary Ig, repeating the washing step after each incubation. We imaged blots on a Li-Cor Odyssey.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Plasmid transfection and flow cytometry</title><p>We transfected HeLa cells using Lipofectamine LTX (Life Technologies) with PR8 proteins HA, NA, M, NP, or NS1 in a pDZ vector and cultured for 24 hr. To enable Ig or VLRB access to internal proteins, we fixed and permeabilized NP, NS1, and M transfected cells with FoxP3 buffer (eBiosciences). We stained all cells with appropriate dye-labeled Ig, mouse sera, or lamprey plasma and analyzed samples using a LSR II flow cytometer and fitted data to a one-site binding hyperbola model using PRISM software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Ab functional inhibition assays</title><p>For HI, we treated lamprey plasma for 56°C for 30 min and incubated with four HAU PR8 before adding human O+ erythrocytes. For neutralization, we cultured MDCK cells (350k) in 24-well plates overnight. The next day we added PR8 at a MOI of 0.07 in the presence of either H17-L2 (anti HA mAb) or control 1.2F4 against influenza B, or lamprey plasma, animal L9 vs naïve plasma diluted in 0.1% BSS/BSA. After 1 hr incubation, we removed the supernatant and replaced with complete media. After 7 more hours, we trypsinized cells, fixed and permeabilized cells with FoxP3 Buffer and stained with anti-HA and anti-NP mAbs, then analyzed cells with a LSR II flow cytometer. Single cells positive for either HA or NP by flow cytometry were considered infected. Data were fitted to a variable dose-response curve and the best-fit infectious dose 50 (ID50) calculated using PRISM software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor), a Guest Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that these results strongly support the idea that protein epitopes share certain physicochemical properties, in addition to simple exposure on the antigen surface, which renders them immunogenic in both jawed and jawless vertebrates.</p><p>Major concern:</p><p>It must be noted that the paper´s conclusion is not entirely original. Specifically, Altman et al. should refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1 and 3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Velikovsky et al. (2009)</xref>. In that study, a comparison of crystal structures revealed that the epitope on hen egg lysozyme recognized by a lamprey VLRB almost completely overlapped the epitope recognized by anti-lysozyme VH antibodies from camel and shark. The same study also reported that Trp and Tyr are the two residues which occur at highest frequency in the ligand-contacting of both VLRBs and Igs, as also seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> of the present work. The authors should revise their text accordingly.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) Lampreys are poikilotherms. Temperature can strongly impact behavior in response to infection and also influences the adaptive immune response in bony fish. In addition, temperature has an impact on the stability of proteins and low temperature can stabilize exposed flexible loops. The authors should describe the environment in which the lampreys were kept, most importantly the temperature of water. In addition, the authors could mention this possible effect of temperature on VLRB responses in lampreys in the Discussion.</p><p>2) Mouse sera bound to permeabilized pDZ-NP transfected Hela cells and lamprey plasma did not. This is an interesting difference. However, both mouse serum and lamprey larvae bound to virions cores in ELISA. This virion core is composed of NP and likely the vRNPs. Are there lamprey VLRBs against the vRNPs and no IgG against vRNPs in the mouse serum? This could be tested using cells transfected with polymerase expression plasmids. Alternatively, NP-specific antibody or VLRB responses may depend more on antigen processing and presentation of NP in the virion than HA and NA specific responses.

However, there are several notable differences between the two studies.</p><p>Velikovsky et al. described a single VLR from a lamprey immunized with a single protein antigen. Obviously, while the structural description of the VLR antigen interaction is elegant, it is not possible to draw general conclusions about how VLRs interact with protein antigens compared with immunoglobulins. The major conclusion of our paper is that the rules of immunogenicity for a complex viral antigen at the level of individual proteins and epitopes is conserved between mammals and lampreys.</p><p>The preference for Tyr and Trp in “ligand-contacting” residues in Velikovsky et al. was based on the alignment of 588 VLRB sequences and quantifying the residues present at the variable positions of each LRR β-strand (residues at the x position in the xLxLxx motif). Although phrased “ligand-contacting” in by Velikovsky et al., the analysis was based on total variable-position residues rather than predicting residues that actually contact antigen based on crystal structure data. The distinction is subtle yet significant, because only roughly one-half (VLRB.2D, 11 of 20; VLR4, 11 of 20) to one-third (RBC36, 11 of 28; aGPA.23, 9 of 28) of the residues in the variable positions actually contact antigen in the available structures. For instance, Asp is the most frequent “ligand-contacting” residue in VLRB.2D, occupying 5 of 20 total positions, yet only two Asp residues actually contact HEL making it fourth most frequent in our analysis (Velikovsky et al., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, red circles above entropy bars).</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Lampreys are poikilotherms.

In addition, temperature has an impact on the stability of proteins and low temperature can stabilize exposed flexible loops. The authors should describe the environment in which the lampreys were kept, most importantly the temperature of water. In addition, the authors could mention this possible effect of temperature on VLRB responses in lampreys in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>The lamprey aquaculture facility is maintained at an ambient air temperature of 16-18<sup>o</sup>C, and we have also housed the animals at room temperature (∼23<sup>o</sup>C) for some experiments. Although we have not rigorously examined the effect of ambient temperature, we haven’t noted obvious temperature related difference in the magnitude or kinetics of the VLRB. The Methods section has been modified to include the aquaculture conditions and temperature information. Since the VLR responses are comparable at the two aquaculture temperatures we have tested, we do not believe that this will add to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) Mouse sera bound to permeabilized pDZ-NP transfected Hela cells and lamprey plasma did not. This is an interesting difference. However, both mouse serum and lamprey larvae bound to virions cores in Elisa. This virion core is composed of NP and likely the vRNPs.

Can the authors exclude that VLRBs cannot enter permeabilized cells?</italic></p><p>The discrepancy between lamprey plasma binding viral cores, but not NP in a flow-based pDZ-NP assay puzzled us as well. We predicted anti-NP VLRBs would be in the immune plasma. To directly address this discrepancy and address the reviewers concerns, we obtained NP generously provided by Yizhe Jane Tao’s lab at Rice University that was sufficiently pure for use in x-ray crystallography studies. In contrast to the flow assay, both immune mouse sera and lamprey plasma bound purified NP by ELISA, clearly demonstrating that lamprey, like mice, respond to NP. These anti-NP VLRBs are likely to account for most of the binding to flu core antigens. As predicted by the reviewers, the lack of VLRB binding to NP expressing cells in the flow assay most likely has a technical explanation.</p><p>We also probed purified M1 protein by ELISA, and as expected, neither the mouse sera nor lamprey mounted a detectable antibody response. Virions only have ∼10 copies of the polymerase complex (∼1% of the major structural proteins. This is at or below the limit of detection of the ELISA we use.</p><p><italic>3) The lack of competition of lamprey immune serum against HA stem specific mabs is based on a negative result (</italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref><italic>). A positive control for competition should be included. Presumably C179 and human 2G02 should compete against each other</italic>.</p><p>This is an excellent suggestion. Mouse C179 does indeed compete with 2G02 by competition ELISA. The requested control has been added to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, and the full curves have been added to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Table 2–source data 3</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
