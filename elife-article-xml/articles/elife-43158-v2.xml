Hfq of the opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> inhibits translation of target transcripts by forming a regulatory complex with the catabolite repression protein Crc. This repressive complex acts as part of an intricate mechanism of preferred nutrient utilisation. We describe high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the assembly of Hfq and Crc bound to the translation initiation site of a target mRNA. The core of the assembly is formed through interactions of two cognate RNAs, two Hfq hexamers and a Crc pair. Additional Crc protomers are recruited to the core to generate higher-order assemblies with demonstrated regulatory activity in vivo. This study reveals how Hfq cooperates with a partner protein to regulate translation, and provides a structural basis for an RNA code that guides global regulators to interact cooperatively and regulate different RNA targets.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43158.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living things can adapt rapidly to changes in their surroundings by switching whole groups of genes on and off. These responses must be controlled carefully, and they are often coordinated by regulatory proteins working together. Within a cell, the coded information in genes is copied to create molecules called mRNAs, which are then translated to produce proteins. Stopping the cell from reading the information in mRNAs is one way of shutting down specific genes.</p><p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a species of bacteria that can infect humans and can cause cases of sepsis and pneumonia. It changes the activity of its genes in response to its environment. For example, certain genes are only active inside a human host. This allows the bacteria to make the best use of available nutrients and energy. In these cells, two proteins named Hfq and Crc cooperate to silence groups of genes. They do this by stopping the cell from reading specific mRNA molecules, but how they do this is not fully understood.</p><p>By using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, Pei, Dendooven et al. studied Hfq and Crc attached to mRNAs. The results show that two groups of six Hfq molecules and two Crcs attach themselves to two mRNA sections to create a structure that stops an mRNA from being translated into a protein. Since the structure only forms with certain mRNAs, the effect is specific to certain genes. The structure needs both Hfq and Crc to work together, which means it only forms in specific situations – when the affected genes are not needed.</p><p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is highly antibiotic resistant and new drugs are urgently needed to control infections. Understanding how this disease-causing bacterium controls its genes could lead to new treatments. The mechanisms of gene regulation are also common to many other forms of life so may also aid the wider understanding of how cells adapt to rapidly changing environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolic regulation</kwd><kwd>riboregulation</kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200873/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luisi</surname><given-names>Ben F</given-names></name><name><surname>Pei</surname><given-names>Xue Yuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Dendooven</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004325</institution-id><institution>AstraZeneca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dendooven</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P28711-B22</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bläsi</surname><given-names>Udo</given-names></name><name><surname>Sonnleitner</surname><given-names>Elisabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural insights show how RNA chaperones cooperate to recognise defined target transcripts and suppress gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The RNA chaperone Hfq contributes to the control of mRNA translation through different modes of action. In one mode, Hfq acts indirectly by facilitating base-pairing interactions of cognate mRNA targets with small regulatory RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vogel and Luisi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wagner and Romby, 2015</xref>). In a second mode, the RNA chaperone can directly repress translation independently of small RNAs, by binding A-rich sequences at or in the vicinity of translation initiation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vecerek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Salvail et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonnleitner and Bläsi, 2014</xref>). As a member of the extensive Lsm/Sm protein family, Hfq shares an ancient structural core that oligomerizes to form toroidal architectures exposing several RNA-binding surfaces. Crystallographic and biophysical data showed that RNA recognition is mediated by distinct interactions with distal, proximal and rim faces of the hexameric ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schumacher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Link et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Horstmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panja et al., 2013</xref>), as well as revealing the role of the unstructured C-terminal tail in auto-regulating RNA-binding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Santiago-Frangos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Santiago-Frangos et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the opportunistic, Gram-negative pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, Hfq acts as a pleiotropic regulator of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonnleitner and Bläsi, 2014</xref>), virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sonnleitner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fernández et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pusic et al., 2016</xref>), quorum sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sonnleitner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Many of these roles are likely facilitated through partner molecules, and numerous putative protein interactors of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Hfq have been identified with functions in transcription, translation and mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Van den Bossche et al., 2014</xref>). In the case of Hfq from <italic>E. coli,</italic> the functionally important partners include RNA polymerase, ribosomal protein S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sukhodolets and Garges, 2003</xref>), the endoribonuclease RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>), polyA-polymerase, and the exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mohanty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyra et al., 2016</xref>). Most likely, these complexes are RNA mediated and affect the co-localisation of the machineries of transcription, translation and RNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Worrall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Resch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vecerek et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>One <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> protein that was found to co-purify with tagged Hfq is the <underline>C</underline>atabolite <underline>r</underline>epression <underline>c</underline>ontrol protein, Crc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Van den Bossche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moreno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnleitner et al., 2018</xref>). Crc is involved in carbon catabolite repression (CCR) in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, a process that channels metabolism to use preferred carbon sources (such as succinate) until they are exhausted, whereupon alternative sources are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rojo, 2010</xref>). In addition to carbon catabolite repression, Hfq and Crc link key metabolic and virulence processes in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species. The two proteins affect biofilm formation, motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">O'Toole et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pusic et al., 2016</xref>), biosynthesis of the virulence factor pyocyanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sonnleitner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>), and antibiotic susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Linares et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Heitzinger, 2016</xref>). Recent ChiP-seq studies indicate that Hfq and Crc have an even broader regulatory impact in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and can work in concert to bind many nascent transcripts co-translationally, uncovering a large number of potential regulatory targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kambara et al., 2018</xref>). Crc is a specialized protein that is found in a limited subset of bacteria including Pseudomonads but excluding Enterobacteriaceae such as <italic>E. coli</italic>. The Crc protein is a member of the EEP family (Exonuclease/Endonuclease/Phosphatase), but the absence of key catalytic residues in the active site cleft indicate that Crc has lost enzymatic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Milojevic et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Crc and Hfq act together to translationally repress mRNA target genes. The targets are then subjected to degradation, which might trigger disassembly of the Hfq/Crc/RNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonnleitner and Bläsi, 2014</xref>). The impact of Hfq/Crc on translational repression is countered by the non-coding RNA CrcZ, which increases in levels when preferred carbon sources are exhausted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sonnleitner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonnleitner and Bläsi, 2014</xref>). CrcZ expression is under control of the alternative sigma factor RpoN and the two-component system CbrA/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sonnleitner et al., 2009</xref>). Although the signal responsible for CbrA/B activation remains unknown, it is thought to be related to the cellular energy status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valentini et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which Hfq and Crc act in translational repression of target mRNAs involves binding of both proteins to ribosome-binding sequences. In the case of the translationally repressed <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA, encoding aliphatic amidase, the distal face of Hfq binds to an A-rich segment termed <italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub> that comprises the ribosome binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonnleitner and Bläsi, 2014</xref>). In contrast, Crc has no intrinsic RNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Milojevic et al., 2013</xref>) but strengthens binding of A-rich target transcripts to the distal side of Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnleitner et al., 2018</xref>). How Hfq binds to A-rich RNAs is structurally understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Link et al., 2009</xref>), but the cooperative role of Crc in this context has not been elucidated. To gain insight into how <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Hfq cooperates with Crc in translational repression of <italic>amiE</italic>, we determined the structure of the complex they form on the Hfq binding motif of the CCR-controlled <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). Our analyses revealed that the components form higher order assemblies and explain for the first time how a widely occurring structural motif can support the association of Hfq and RNA into cooperative ribonucleoprotein complexes that have regulatory roles. We observe that the interactions supporting the quaternary structure are required for in vivo translational regulation. These findings expand the paradigm for in vivo action of Hfq through cooperation with the Crc helper protein and RNA to form effector assemblies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An ensemble of Hfq/Crc/amiE<sub>6ARN</sub>RNA assemblies</title><p>For cryo-EM structural studies of the Hfq/Crc/RNA complex, purified recombinant Hfq and Crc proteins were mixed with an 18 nucleotide Hfq binding motif from the translation initiation region of the CCR-controlled <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA (hereafter termed <italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub>). The defined sequence (5'-AAA-AAU-AAC-AAC-AAG-AAG-3') has a binding motif comprised of 6 repeats of an A-R-N pattern preferred by the distal face of Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonnleitner and Bläsi, 2014</xref>). The 18 nucleotides of <italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub> could be distinguished in the cryoEM maps and will be referred to with numbers 1–18 from the 5´ to the 3´ end. The purified sample of Hfq/Crc/<italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub>, after mild chemical crosslinking, yielded well defined single particles on graphene oxide in thin, vitreous ice. Analysis of the reference free 2D class averages and subsequent 3D classification indicated three principal types of complexes corresponding to different stoichiometries of Hfq (hexamer):Crc:<italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub> with compositions 2:2:2, 2:3:2 and 2:4:2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These higher order assemblies are in agreement with recently observed SEC-MALS and mass spectrometry results which excluded a simple 1:1:1 assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnleitner et al., 2018</xref>). The maps for the complexes are estimated to be 3.1 Å, 3.4 Å and 3.2 Å in resolution, respectively, based on gold-standard Fourier shell correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The individual crystal structures of Hfq and Crc dock well into the cryoEM densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and aside from side chain rotations there are few other structural changes of the components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To probe for artefacts introduced by the crosslinking experiments, CryoEM analyses were subsequently performed with samples that had not been treated by crosslinking using grid preparation conditions optimised for the crosslinked specimens. Although limited to lower resolution, data from these specimens revealed that the quaternary structure remained unchanged within the resolution limits of the data for the model being compared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43158.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reference free 2D classification and 3D classification of Hfq/Crc/RNA particles.</title><p>Three main classes of particles were observed after reference-free 2D classification (top), corresponding to Hfq/Crc/<italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub> assemblies with compositional stoichiometries of 2:2:2, 2:3:2 and 2:4:2.

Each of the six RNA triplets of the <italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub> RNA fits into an inter-subunit cleft in Hfq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The specific, star-shaped RNA fold is guided by six positively charged protuberances on the distal face of Hfq, with the phosphate backbone circularly weaving in between these, seemingly to minimise steric hindrance while maximizing surface interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Link et al. (2009)</xref>, each pocket consists of an adenosine specificity site (A), a purine nucleotide specificity site (R), and a presumed RNA entrance/exit site (N) which is non-discriminatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hfq thus has a structural preference for (ARN)<sub>n</sub> RNA stretches on its distal side, where N is any nucleotide. The adenosine specificity (A) sites are organised identically to the corresponding A sites in <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq, forming hydrogen bonds between the peptide backbone and carboxyl-groups of Gln33 and the N6,7 atoms of the adenosine base, and a polar interaction between Gln52 (N<sub>ε</sub>) and the N1 atom of the adenosine base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The peptide backbone amide of residue Lys31 interacts with the 5’ phosphate group of adenine. Finally, the adenine base is stacked against the side chain of Leu32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The interactions with N1, by the carbonyl of Q33, and N7, by the amide of Q33, confer pocket-specificity for A as they are not compatible with a G, which would form a repulsive contact <italic>via</italic> its O6 and peptide carbonyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The purine (R) specificity site is defined by two neighbouring monomers, where the side chains from Tyr25 and from Leu26’, Ile30’ and Leu32’ (where the prime denotes residues from a neighbouring subunit) contact the nucleotide aromatic base. In <italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub>, one R-site is populated by a guanine, forming a hydrogen bond between the N<sub>ε</sub> of Gln52’ and the guanine exocyclic O6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Just like in the <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq/polyA<sub>18</sub> structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Link et al., 2009</xref>), Gln52’ forms a physical link between the A and R sites. Previous structures were obtained from polyA RNA, whereas the structures presented here were solved with the authentic <italic>amiE</italic> Hfq recognition site. Interestingly, Thr61 O<sub>γ</sub> forms a double hydrogen bond with the N1 and the exocyclic N2 from the guanine base, which was not seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Link et al., 2009</xref>) as all R-sites were occupied by adenine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As we will describe further below, the N site base interacts with Crc, but without apparent sequence preference.

First, we asked whether R140 (Crc<sub>R140</sub>) is required for the interaction of the protein with the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom left inset).

The de-repression of <italic>amiE:lacZ</italic> observed with the Crc<sub>E142R</sub> variant was partially compensated by the double mutant proteins Crc<sub>E142R, R229E</sub> and Crc<sub>E142R, R230E</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

As the respective Crc variant proteins were produced at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), these mutational studies support the in vivo role for the interactions of the Crc protomers observed in the cryo-EM models.

The added value of the Crc in the complex as compared to recognition of the A-rich sequence by Hfq is the potential for highly cooperative switches for activation/repression and greater specificity.</p><p>The <italic>amiE</italic> RNA translation control site is an A-rich fragment that occupies almost entirely the distal surface of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Hfq, weaving in between basic, surface exposed islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). There are striking similarities to the structure of the polyA<sub>18</sub> complex with <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Link et al., 2009</xref>), which greatly added to the understanding of RNA binding and chaperone mechanisms, and hinted at how the distinct polyA RNA interaction might enable Hfq-mediated regulation. The polyA<sub>18</sub>/Hfq structure revealed rules for recognition of motifs of the type A-R-N, where R is purine and N is any base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Hfq interaction with <italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub> follows the same rules. The A-R-N repeat occurs in many RNAs, and it is a recurring motif in the nascent transcripts that associate with Hfq and Crc in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kambara et al., 2018</xref>). It has been proposed that the exposed bases (at the Entry/Exit site, corresponding to ‘N’ in the A-R-N motif) could mediate RNA to RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schulz et al., 2017</xref>), but we observe that the exposed bases are presented for protein recognition. The exposed bases at the ‘N’ position and RNA backbone in the Hfq/<italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub> complex are available for interactions with Crc to form a cooperative assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) that mediates translational repression on target mRNAs, that is carbon catabolite repression in vivo when the preferred carbon source is available. Strikingly, the A-R-N motif is not supported by the Hfq of the Gram-positive bacteria <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Horstmann et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In view of this divergence, it seems unlikely that Hfq in the Gram-positive species form assemblies that resemble the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Hfq/Crc assembly.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that both Hfq and Crc are required for tight translational repression of mRNAs, which are subject to carbon catabolite repression (CCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonnleitner and Bläsi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moreno et al., 2015</xref>). The presence of Crc did not significantly enhance the affinity of Hfq for <italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnleitner et al., 2018</xref>). However, the simultaneous interactions of Crc with both binding partners resulted in an Hfq/Crc/RNA assembly with increased stability when compared with the Hfq/RNA complex alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnleitner et al., 2018</xref>). In light of our structural studies, the enhancing effect of Crc in Hfq-mediated translational repression of target mRNAs during CCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonnleitner and Bläsi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moreno et al., 2015</xref>) can be explained by sandwiching the Hfq binding site on mRNA between both binding partners. Thus, the structural model can rationalize the observed increased stability of the Hfq/Crc/<italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub> assembly when compared to the sole Hfq/<italic>amiE<sub>6ARN</sub></italic> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnleitner et al., 2018</xref>). It is conceivable that full repression is only achieved when <italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub> is masked entirely in the 2:4:2 complex, which is supported by our in vivo studies.</p><p>The question arises why a higher order assembly such as the 2:2:2 core is formed and not a simpler complex. The structural data indicate that the dimerization of Crc provides the key step for formation of the 2:2:2 complex, because it will pre-organise a copy of the surface that interacts with a binary Hfq/RNA complex so that a second Hfq/RNA complex can be recruited. Thus, all components seem to be necessary to form the complex so that there is no formation of lower order ‘sub assemblies’. The structural data are consistent with Crc having no capacity for RNA binding by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Milojevic et al., 2013</xref>). The Hfq/Crc/RNA complex may thus be assembled in a checklist-like manner through numerous small contacting surfaces and when the RNA target is presented by Hfq in a specific, well-defined configuration. In this way, the components interact mutually through chelate cooperative effects. It seem likely that the 2:2:2 core is formed first followed by recruitment of the other Crc components.</p><p>We envisage that the 2:2:2 core and higher order assemblies might interact with other mRNAs. The higher order assembly could capture two of such mRNA substrates as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>, but chelate effects might instead induce formation of the complex on a single mRNA target. In that scenario, a portion of the mRNA could thread through the central basic half channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5ii</xref> and potentially recruit the second Hfq hexamer. In this context it is worth noting that several mRNAs, including <italic>amiE</italic>, which are directly repressed by Hfq/Crc comprise another putative Hfq binding motif downstream of the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnleitner et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we are currently exploring the possibility whether this second Hfq binding motif contributes to Hfq/Crc assembly on longer mRNA substrates and whether it likewise may confer specificity for these Hfq/Crc repressed substrates.</p><p>Under conditions of catabolite repression regulation, pull-down assays showed that Hfq and Crc form a co-complex in the presence of the 426nt long CrcZ RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moreno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnleitner et al., 2018</xref>). In the presence of less preferred carbon sources, the expression levels of CrcZ RNA increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sonnleitner et al., 2009</xref>) and CrcZ functions as an antagonist in Hfq/Crc mediated translational repression of catabolic genes. The CrcZ RNA has multiple A-R-N triplets that could be sites for Hfq/Crc interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonnleitner and Bläsi, 2014</xref>) and sequester multiple Hfq/Crc proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, under conditions where CCR is relieved, CrcZ RNA would serve as a sponge for Hfq/Crc to prevent repression of genes encoding proteins required for the utilization of less preferred carbon sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). How the CrcZ RNA is displaced from Hfq/Crc remains unknown. However, the assemblies are likely to be dynamic and the displacement process might resemble that proposed for the step-wise exchange of sRNAs on Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fender et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recent findings show that the regulatory spectrum of Hfq and Crc is much broader than initially expected. Hfq was found to bind more than 600 nascent transcripts co-transcriptionally often in concert with Crc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kambara et al., 2018</xref>). These findings indicate that Hfq and Crc together regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally beyond just catabolite repression. Understanding how gene expression is regulated post-transcriptionally in pathogens such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> may provide potential targets for novel drug design. Hfq and Crc are involved in key metabolic and virulence processes in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">O'Toole et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sonnleitner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sonnleitner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Linares et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonnleitner and Bläsi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pusic et al., 2016</xref>). Disrupting the interface of the core assembly of the Hfq/Crc complex might be one strategy to counter, among other, metabolic regulation and consequently its downstream processes that impact on virulence during infection. A recent study showed how overproduction of the aliphatic amidase AmiE strongly reduced biofilm formation and almost fully attenuated virulence in, amongst others, a mouse model of acute lung infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clamens et al., 2017</xref>). Novel drugs that specifically counteract Hfq/Crc/<italic>amiE</italic> assembly formation and prevent repression of AmiE production could induce the phenotype described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clamens et al. (2017)</xref>. The high resolution structures presented here provide a starting point for novel strategies to interfere with carbon regulation in a pathogenic bacterium for therapeutic intervention of threatening infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> <break/><italic>aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td><italic>crc</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>Pseudomonas <break/>genome database: <break/>PA5332</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td><italic>amiE</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>Pseudomonas <break/>genome database: <break/>PA3366</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td>PAO1</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/111024">111024</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td>PAO1Δcrc</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20080802">20080802</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>XL1-Blue</td><td>Stratagene</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21(DE3)</td><td>Novagen</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td><italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub> RNA</td><td>Microsynth, <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29244160">29244160</ext-link></td><td>sequence: <break/>5'-AAAAAUAACAACAAGAAG-3'</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Crc (rabbit <break/>polyclonal)</td><td>Pineda</td><td>(1:5000)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Hfq (rabbit <break/>polyclonal)</td><td>Pineda</td><td>(1:10000)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-S1 (rabbit <break/>polyclonal)</td><td>Pineda</td><td>(1:10000)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-rabbit IgG <break/>(goat polyclonal)</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Sigma: A3687</td><td>conjugated with alkaline <break/>phosphatase, (1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pME9655 <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20080802">20080802</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pETM14lic-His<sub>6</sub>Crc <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23717639">23717639</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pME4510<italic>crc</italic><sub>Flag</sub> <break/>(plasmid)</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29244160">29244160</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td>Hfq</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21330354">21330354</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td>Crc</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23717639">23717639</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Relion3</td><td>DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.42166">10.7554/eLife.42166</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>LocScale</td><td>DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27131">10.7554/eLife.27131</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>LocalDeblur</td><td>DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/433284">10.1101/433284</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein synthesis, purification and complex formation</title><p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Hfq and Crc were produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnleitner et al.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Architectural principles for Hfq/Crc-mediated regulation of gene expression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present an exceptionally significant set of structures that reveal how Hfq and associated cofactor proteins interact with mRNA in order to facilitate translation and coordinate interactions with sRNA molecules. This is really the first glimpse of these important complexes and the molecular recognition and assembly pathways that are in play. It is truly exceptional work and the reviewers were very enthusiastic. That said, there is a need to restructure the paper so that it is focused on the most significant issues, and to provide stronger functional data to support the structural findings, as described below and in the reviews.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the reviews and in subsequent conversation among the reviewers, there was unanimity on the need to restructure the paper so that it is focused on the main complexes and their significance to biology. The paper should be organized in a more effective way (please refer to the comments) and that major findings should be presented and discussed in light of their importance and relevance to the field at large. The text needs to be rewritten for clarity and context.</p><p>2) There was also general agreement that the supporting biochemical data should be strengthened, and the experiments suggested in the major comments by the referees should be conducted in some form in order to support the work. While the reviewers do not want to place undue burden on the investigators, there are places in the manuscript where critical supporting functional experiments still need to be included, as indicated. In addition, more attention must be devoted to a description of the methodological approaches, as these impact the findings directly in this case.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a fascinating manuscript that not only provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of Hfq function and its interplay with cofactors, but also contains lessons for understanding regulatory RNA-protein complexes in general. The structures themselves are intriguing and they provide a trove of information on molecular recognition strategies within RNA-protein complexes. For example, Figure 2 is particularly interesting as no single type of interaction is completely new, but the way they are used on concert is extremely informative. The one weakness of the paper (in addition to a relatively poor presentation of the different types of complexes) is the weak supporting data on the protein-protein interactions. Attention to the points below would strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.</p><p>1) Subsection “Protein synthesis, purification and complex formation”: More experimental details about complex assembly are useful but also important for mechanistic understanding. Was it necessary to incubate the RNA and the Hfq hexamer first before adding Crc? What order of addition experiments were done to arrive at this procedure? How did the authors determine the stoichiometry for Crc? Combining the RNA/Hfq/Crc in a 1:1:1 ratio is hard to understand given the ultimate stoichiometries observed in the particles – so why didn't the authors go back and try again? This is important, as it is germane to the biological relevance described later in the paper. Given the distribution of particle stoichiometries (Figure 1), why were other assembly conditions not tried and if they were, why were they not used? Some of this is discussed in Sonnleitner, and specific results from that paper could be cited more clearly in support of the present manuscript.</p><p>2) Subsection “An ensemble of Hfq/Crc/<italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub>RNA assemblies”, first paragraph: Mild crosslinking conditions were purportedly used. Were others tried? The end of the paragraph says crosslinking does not affect structure. So why was it used? What did it help?</p><p>3) Subsection “An ensemble of Hfq/Crc/<italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub>RNA assemblies”, last paragraph: In the first part of the paper, there is too little focus on the overall organization and features of the 2:2:2 complex and far too much focus on the organization of complexes in the different stoichiometries – it distracts from the basic elements that are common to all three and which are likely to be of central importance. For example, the discussion of symmetry is interesting, but not central and will not help with general understanding of function by most readers. Instead, in this part of the paper, it would be good to focus on overall organization of the 2:2:2 given that it is later suggested to be the most relevant one. In the opinion of this reviewer, the first part of the paper should not have figures and text with such an emphasis on alternative stoichiometries.</p><p>4) The pull-down experimental data shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 are qualitative and not well explained. It's not clear to the reader how the raw data demonstrate complex formation or specific interfaces unambiguously, at least as shown. Given the affinities known for these proteins, using EMSA or size/exclusion+MALS as experimental techniques on mutants would significantly strengthen this paper. That said, a clear and compelling explanation of why the existing data are sufficient might obviate the need for these experiments.</p><p>5) Subsection “Function, origins and validation of subunit cooperativity in the 2:2:2 complex”, third paragraph. The authors state that mutant Crc<sub>R140E</sub> did not co-IP with Hfq – but the data in the Figure 2—figure supplement 1B look just like WT Crc, so this seems to undermine the authors' point, unless there is some type of misunderstanding. Another issue: it appears from the structure that R140 also participates in the Crc1-Crc2 interface by contacting E193 (in the 4jg3 crystal structure of Crc), whereas the authors only discuss its role in RNA binding. E193, instead is described by the authors to be relevant only in the Crc3-Crc4 interface. A more balanced and careful discussion of these interfaces is therefore suggested.</p><p>6) Subsection “A specialised and recurring RNA conformation in Hfq-mediated regulation”, last paragraph: The molecular determinants for A and R specificity are among the more central issues for this field, but this is not covered extensively. H-bonds consistent with a specificity pocket are observed and noted (Figure 4), but these do not necessarily confer specificity. Have the amino acids interacting with the N6 amine and N1 been mutated and tested previously and is this why the authors have not made these mutations? If so, the results should be discussed. That said, it would seem reasonable to test the effect of these mutants in the context of this more biologically relevant RNA sequence.</p><p>7) Discussion, third paragraph: It would be best if the stepwise assembly process of the higher-order complex were tested experimentally through order of additional experiments, SEC-mals or similarly informative biophysical experiments given the emphasis on the 2:4:2 complex given within the paper. This gets back to point #1, above. Otherwise, the authors need to change the speculative language in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This work presents exciting high resolution cryo EM structures (and some functional validation experiments) showing how the Crc 'helper' protein recognizes a composite Hfq-RNA surface and thus can act as a cofactor of Hfq-mediated RNA regulation in bacteria. The structure represents an important advance in our molecular understanding of Hfq function and demonstrates that it should be feasible to analyze similar Hfq complexes by cryo EM in the future. I'd enthusiastically support publication of the work in <italic>eLife</italic> after the overall description of the structure is improved to be more amenable to more generally interested readers.</p><p>The structure is not very clearly described and structure description is difficult to follow even for readers who have previously seen similar structures. A more streamlined description of the overall structure going from known interactions (Hfq-RNA) to the novel and exciting features (role of Crc in complex assembly), and a precise assignment of interface names (without swapping between symmetry-related interfaces) would help the general reader to better appreciate the principles of complex assembly and RNA recognition in the present case. Otherwise the most exciting insight from this work, i.e. how Crc improves RNA recognition and stabilizes the Hfq-RNA interaction gets lost too much in structural details (see point 2).</p><p>The Introduction could profit from some clarifications to help general readers understand and evaluate the significance of the present work (see point 1).</p><p>Some of the references to data by Sonnleitner et al., 2018, are rather vague and corresponding statements remain obscure without detailed prior knowledge of the work by Sonnleitner (see point 3).</p><p>1) Introduction</p><p>1.1) Clarify early in the general introduction of Hfq that Hfq controls mRNA translation not only indirectly (via small RNAs) but also directly (i.e. independently of small RNAs) by binding A-rich sequences at/near the mRNA translation initiation sites. Later on in the Introduction, mention that <italic>amiE</italic> RNA is such a case where Hfq's distal side binds A-rich sequences. This would also be a good occasion to mention that A-rich RNA binding to Hfq is principally understood in structural terms (Link et al.), but that the role of Crc in this context remained obscure and is the topic of the present study.</p><p>1.2) Clarify in the Introduction that Crc is a rather specialized protein that is not generally found in all bacteria but rather in a limited subset including <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> but excluding e.g. <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Such a statement does not limit the scope of the paper but helps the reader understand why the presented structure is so useful also for the design of selective drugs/inhibitors.</p><p>1.3) Mention in the Introduction that Crc is a very interesting member of the EEP protein family (Exonuclease/Endonuclease/Phosphatase) although key active site residues in the active site cleft are mutated. Information of the orientation of the active site cleft in the complex may be helpful in overall structure description (facing outward, laterally). Although Crc is catalytically inactive, I wonder whether it might bind phosphorylated sugars or metabolites in its active site cleft and hence helps to sense available carbon sources. Is anything known in this direction?</p><p>2) Structure description</p><p>2.1) Most importantly, I would suggest to improve and reorganize the description of the overall complex and of the individual interfaces. The authors use a defined nucleotide sequence (5'-AAA-AAU-AAC-AAC-AAG-AAG-3', note it down at the beginning of the Results section), and they assign nucleotide numbers in their structure model. In contrast to Link et al., the RNA density is hence not averaged over the Hfq hexamer and the 5' and 3' ends are visible. Consequently, it should be possible to number Hfq monomers from one (nucleotides 1-3) to six (nucleotides 16-18) and use these Hfq monomer numbers in the description of the various interfaces.</p><p>2.2) It seems more 'intuitive' to begin complex description with the Hfq-RNA complex and to point out what is novel/unique/different as compared to previous such complexes published by Link et al., 2009, or also Horstmann et al., 2012. In the following, all of the Crc interactions (i.e. with Crc1, Crc2 and Crc3) can then be described with only one of the Hfq-RNA complexes (since all of the interactions with the second Hfq ring are symmetry-related).</p><p>2.3) In a second step, one then could describe how the twofold symmetric Crc1-Crc2 dimer recognizes and binds over the Hfq-RNA interface, how the Hfq-RNA complex stabilizes the Crc1-Crc2 dimer and why the 2:2:2 complex forms cooperatively in an all-or-nothing fashion. Here one can then also describe and validate the Crc1-Crc2 interface in comparison to existing crystal packing interactions in Milojevic et al., 2013, (but also previously in Wei et al., 2012).</p><p>2.4) In a third step, one would then describe how Crc3 recognizes the Hfq-RNA complex, maybe in comparison to Crc1 and Crc2. Does Crc3 interact at all with Crc1 or Crc2? Finally, one could compare the Crc3-Crc4 interface to the Crc1-Crc2 interface and describe how the two Crc dimers are oriented with respect to each other in the full complex. As the authors point out, the Crc3-Crc4 interface is somewhat less important than the Crc1-Crc2 interface, because Crc3 and Crc4 can be added in a stepwise fashion.</p><p>3) Structure validation</p><p>3.1) Regarding structure validation, the authors mainly test for the different Crc dimer interfaces and only using duplicates in the translational repression reporter assay. It might be worthwhile to solidify these results and also test E142A and E193A mutants in order to see whether charge compensation really is the correct interpretation for the success of the rescue experiments. It also seems from the Crc crystal structure that E193 participates as well in the Crc1-Crc2 dimer interface. Maybe tone done a bit the exclusive importance of E193 for the Crc3-Crc4 interface. Moreover, since the authors have access to size exclusion chromatography and MALS instrumentation, they could for example test as well to which degree changes in the RNA sequence affect recognition by Crc and complex formation. Although not strictly required, these experiments clearly would strengthen the paper.</p><p>3.2) On various occasions, the authors rather vaguely point to previous results obtained by Sonnleitner et al., 2018, in support of the present cryo-EM structure. It would be good to also cite numeric values (e.g. subsection “An ensemble of Hfq/Crc/<italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub>RNA assemblies”, first paragraph, ~220 kDa?) or define more precisely which mutants, experiments or data they have in mind when citing this paper (e.g. subsection “Function, origins and validation of subunit cooperativity in the 2:2:2 complex”, third paragraph).</p><p>3.3) Finally, in the Discussion, the authors might want to stress a bit more that this is the first time that structural information was obtained on how a 'helper' protein of Hfq can assist and specify the role of Hfq in direct translational repression. They also might want to explain a bit more extensively and speculate on what is the added value of Crc in the complex as compared to a simple recognition of the A-rich sequence by Hfq. In the second paragraph of the Discussion, it would again be important to be more precise and distinguish between thermodynamic and kinetic stability – otherwise this passage of the text is quite confusing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study reveals for the first time the molecular mechanism by which two major regulatory proteins Hfq and Crc cooperate to regulate the translation of mRNAs in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. High-resolution structures of complexes formed by Hfq, Crc and the operator regulatory region of <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA were solved using cryo-EM. Based on these structures, specific mutations were introduced into Crc to analyze their ability to form RNP and to regulate <italic>amiE</italic> translation. Taken together, the authors visualized how Crc and Hfq assemble around a specific binding site on <italic>amiE</italic> mRNA to regulate translation initiation. This work is incredible and illustrates the importance of RNP assembly in the regulation of gene expression in bacteria. This work beautifully showed how a strong RNA binder (Hfq) is able to recruit proteins that are not able solely to bind RNA (Crc) in order to expand the regulatory networks. This work is incredible and opens up new ideas, i.e. to search for novel translational regulators, but also should pave the way to identify novel strategies interfering with the metabolism of pathogenic bacteria. This is an important paper, which also reconciles previous published works on Crc function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43158.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a fascinating manuscript that not only provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of Hfq function and its interplay with cofactors, but also contains lessons for understanding regulatory RNA-protein complexes in general. The structures themselves are intriguing and they provide a trove of information on molecular recognition strategies within RNA-protein complexes. For example, Figure 2 is particularly interesting as no single type of interaction is completely new, but the way they are used on concert is extremely informative. The one weakness of the paper (in addition to a relatively poor presentation of the different types of complexes) is the weak supporting data on the protein-protein interactions. Attention to the points below would strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.</p><p>1)Subsection “Protein synthesis, purification and complex formation”: More experimental details about complex assembly are useful but also important for mechanistic understanding. Was it necessary to incubate the RNA and the Hfq hexamer first before adding Crc? What order of addition experiments were done to arrive at this procedure? How did the authors determine the stoichiometry for Crc? Combining the RNA/Hfq/Crc in a 1:1:1 ratio is hard to understand given the ultimate stoichiometries observed in the particles – so why didn't the authors go back and try again? This is important, as it is germane to the biological relevance described later in the paper. Given the distribution of particle stoichiometries (Figure 1), why were other assembly conditions not tried and if they were, why were they not used? Some of this is discussed in Sonnleitner, and specific results from that paper could be cited more clearly in support of the present manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not exhaustively explored the order of addition to optimise the reconstitution, but we reasoned that the Hfq/RNA interaction is the stronger interaction and would nucleate the assembly. The conditions and search for optimal conditions were described in Sonnleitner et al., 2018, and we have added a comment to the revised text (first paragraph: Materials and methods). We also mentioned that SEC-MALS (Sonnleitner et al., 2018) have excluded a simple 1:1:1 assembly (subsection “An ensemble of Hfq/Crc/<italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub>RNA assemblies”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “An ensemble of Hfq/Crc/amiE<sub>6ARN</sub>RNA assemblies”, first paragraph: Mild crosslinking conditions were purportedly used. Were others tried? The end of the paragraph says crosslinking does not affect structure. So why was it used? What did it help?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the bifunctional crosslinker BS3 to prepare specimens for all high-resolution datasets to maintain the complexes during grid preparations. To ensure that the observed assemblies were not artefacts from the crosslinking procedure, we subsequently collected a smaller data set without crosslinker and found that the structure remained unchanged within the resolution limits of the data for the models being compared. This is now explicitly mentioned in the subsection “An ensemble of Hfq/Crc/<italic>amiE</italic><sub>6ARN</sub>RNA assemblies”, and the results are presented in Supplementary file 1, Table S1. Given that no crosslinking artefacts were found, we did not further use/optimise the non-crosslinked datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “An ensemble of Hfq/Crc/amiE<sub>6ARN</sub>RNA assemblies”, last paragraph: In the first part of the paper, there is too little focus on the overall organization and features of the 2:2:2 complex and far too much focus on the organization of complexes in the different stoichiometries – it distracts from the basic elements that are common to all three and which are likely to be of central importance. For example, the discussion of symmetry is interesting, but not central and will not help with general understanding of function by most readers. Instead, in this part of the paper, it would be good to focus on overall organization of the 2:2:2 given that it is later suggested to be the most relevant one. In the opinion of this reviewer, the first part of the paper should not have figures and text with such an emphasis on alternative stoichiometries.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-organised the text to focus first on the 2:2:2 complex, and then turn to the other complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The pull-down experimental data shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 are qualitative and not well explained. It's not clear to the reader how the raw data demonstrate complex formation or specific interfaces unambiguously, at least as shown. Given the affinities known for these proteins, using EMSA or size/exclusion+MALS as experimental techniques on mutants would significantly strengthen this paper. That said, a clear and compelling explanation of why the existing data are sufficient might obviate the need for these experiments.</p><p>The IP data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A are qualitative but suggest that there is a good agreement between the in vivo data and the in vitro results, indicating that the purified components are sufficient to recapitulate the complexity of the in vivo process. The method for the pull down is described in Sonnleitner et al., 2018, and we have changed the text to explain the data more clearly (subsection “Function, origins and validation of subunit cooperativity in the 2:2:2 complex”, second paragraph).</p><p>5) Subsection “Function, origins and validation of subunit cooperativity in the 2:2:2 complex”, third paragraph. The authors state that mutant Crc<sub>R140E</sub> did not co-IP with Hfq – but the data in the Figure 2—figure supplement 1B look just like WT Crc, so this seems to undermine the authors' point, unless there is some type of misunderstanding. Another issue: it appears from the structure that R140 also participates in the Crc1-Crc2 interface by contacting E193 (in the 4jg3 crystal structure of Crc), whereas the authors only discuss its role in RNA binding. E193, instead is described by the authors to be relevant only in the Crc3-Crc4 interface. A more balanced and careful discussion of these interfaces is therefore suggested.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B show the input levels for the proteins used in the pulldowns for Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. In the 4jg3 crystal structure R140 indeed participates in the Crc1-Crc2 dimer interface, however, in our maps the density for R140 clearly shows a rotamer shift pulling the R140 side chain away from E193 and towards A3 of <italic>amiE</italic> in the Entry/Exit site. This has now been addressed in the revised text. E193 does participate in the dimer interface of Crc3-Crc4 via contacts with R230 and R233 (Figure 4A and 4C), as discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “A specialised and recurring RNA conformation in Hfq-mediated regulation”, last paragraph: The molecular determinants for A and R specificity are among the more central issues for this field, but this is not covered extensively. H-bonds consistent with a specificity pocket are observed and noted (Figure 4), but these do not necessarily confer specificity. Have the amino acids interacting with the N6 amine and N1 been mutated and tested previously and is this why the authors have not made these mutations? If so, the results should be discussed. That said, it would seem reasonable to test the effect of these mutants in the context of this more biologically relevant RNA sequence.</p></disp-quote><p>The network of hydrogen bonding interactions with the A and R in the A-R-N pattern in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> aeruginosa Hfq are consistent with the interactions observed by Link et al., 2009, for the <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq with polyA<sub>18</sub>. The interactions do specify sequence preferences in a way that is consistent with binding affinities and rationalisation from the structure. For instance, the interactions with N1 (by the carbonyl of Q33) and N7 (by the amide of Q33) specify A as they are not compatible with a G, which form a repulsive contact of the O6 and peptide carbonyl. These interactions cannot be tested by mutagenesis because they do not involve side chain changes. Other changes in Hfq cannot be tested easily in vivo because of the pleotropic effect on many other RNA processes mediated by Hfq. We have changed the text to discuss the basis for the specificity.</p><p>We would also like to mention that our colleagues Jiri Sponer and Miroslav Krepl have found that the A in the A-R-N can switch between syn and anti-conformations in molecular dynamics simulations, and that both conformations are only compatible with A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion, third paragraph: It would be best if the stepwise assembly process of the higher-order complex were tested experimentally through order of additional experiments, SEC-mals or similarly informative biophysical experiments given the emphasis on the 2:4:2 complex given within the paper. This gets back to point #1, above. Otherwise, the authors need to change the speculative language in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The proposed assembly process is inferred from the fact that the assemblies all share the same core 2:2:2 complex. Nevertheless, we have changed the text as suggested so that it is less speculative. The 2:4:2 complex is demonstrated to be important in vivo, as shown by the second site revertants (Figure 4B).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This work presents exciting high resolution cryo EM structures (and some functional validation experiments) showing how the Crc 'helper' protein recognizes a composite Hfq-RNA surface and thus can act as a cofactor of Hfq-mediated RNA regulation in bacteria. The structure represents an important advance in our molecular understanding of Hfq function and demonstrates that it should be feasible to analyze similar Hfq complexes by cryo EM in the future.
