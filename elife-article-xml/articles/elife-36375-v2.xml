cycle machinery. In contrast, postmitotic multiciliated cells (MCCs) uncouple centriole assembly from cell cycle progression and produce hundreds of centrioles in the absence of DNA replication to serve as basal bodies for motile cilia. Although some cell cycle regulators have previously been implicated in motile ciliogenesis, how the cell cycle machinery is employed to amplify centrioles is unclear. We use transgenic mice and primary airway epithelial cell culture to show that Cdk2, the kinase responsible for the G1 to S phase transition, is also required in MCCs to initiate motile ciliogenesis. While Cdk2 is coupled with cyclins E and A2 during cell division, cyclin A1 is required during ciliogenesis, contributing to an alternative regulatory landscape that facilitates centriole amplification without DNA replication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>ciliogenesis</kwd><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>Cdk2</kwd><kwd>Cyclin A1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM052022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stearns</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM121424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stearns</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Axelrod</surname><given-names>Jeffrey D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01HD034915</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolgemuth</surname><given-names>Debra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cyclin-dependentkinase 2 (Cdk2), the master regulator of S phase events during the cell cycle, controls the earliest step in the motile ciliogenesis pathway in quiescent multiciliatedairway epithelial cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Centrioles are microtubule-based, radially symmetric, cylindrical structures. A pair of centrioles, and surrounding pericentriolar material, comprise the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vertii et al., 2016</xref>). In interphase, one of the centrioles can serve as basal body for a primary cilium while the pericentriolar material is a principal site for cytoplasmic microtubule nucleation and organization. In mitosis, centrosomes regulate the assembly and orientation of the mitotic spindle. In these roles, centrioles are vital to fundamental cellular processes including signal transduction, intracellular trafficking and cell division. Dysfunction of centrioles or associated structures results in developmental and adult tissue maintenance defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2011</xref>), which have been linked to human disease, notably ciliopathies and cancer.</p><p>In dividing cells, centriole generation occurs in S phase of the cell cycle when exactly two new (daughter) centrioles assemble, each next to an existing (mother) centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">FÄ±rat-Karalar and Stearns, 2014</xref>). The resulting two centrosomes then segregate into the two daughter cells during mitosis to reduce the centriole number to two in each daughter. Control of centriole number is important for proper cellular function: extra centrioles can lead to abnormal mitoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2008</xref>) or give rise to extra primary cilia that results in defective signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mahjoub and Stearns, 2012</xref>). Centriole generation is highly regulated to ensure the assembly of the correct number of structures by limiting duplication to S phase, by limiting assembly to one new daughter centriole alongside each mother centriole, by blocking the de novo (noncentriolar) generation of extra centrioles, and by coupling centriole and DNA duplication under common timing and regulation.</p><p>Multiciliated cells (MCCs) of the airway, ependymal, middle ear and oviduct epithelia break the rules that govern centriole formation in dividing cells, as they assemble, depending on cell type, dozens to hundreds of centrioles in a single postmitotic cytoplasm to act as basal bodies to motile cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meunier and Azimzadeh, 2016</xref>). MCC fate is acquired in a Notch signaling-dependent manner, with cells experiencing Notch activation becoming secretory cells and cells not experiencing Notch activation progressing down the MCC pathwayÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsao et al., 2009</xref>). Ciliogenesis is initiated when nascent MCCs launch a MCC-specific transcriptional program to express hundreds of ciliary genes. Next, centrioles form in the cytoplasm, traffic to and dock with the apical plasma membrane and elongate a motile ciliary axoneme. In contrast to dividing cells, MCCs are capable of (1) generating centrioles in the postmitotic or G0 phase, (2) generating many daughter centrioles per mother centriole, (3) using unique structures termed deuterosomes for the de novo (noncentriolar) assembly of centrioles, and (4) uncoupling centriole and DNA duplication. Yet, both MCCs and dividing cells produce apparently structurally identical centrioles, and the MCC pathway appears to rely on many known cell cycle regulated centrosome duplication factors such as the Plk4 kinase and structural components including Sass6 and Centrin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vladar and Stearns, 2007</xref>). This suggests that there are both universal pathways as well as MCC specific alterations that permit large scale postmitotic centriole amplification.</p><p>Mechanisms that control centriole number in dividing cells consist of both centriole-intrinsic and cytoplasmic events. Limiting centriole duplication to S phase is ultimately under the control of the cell cycle machinery. Timely entry and progression through S phase is regulated by Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complexed with cyclins E or A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hochegger et al., 2008</xref>). Distinct Cdk-cyclin pairs control cell cycle transitions through a highly orchestrated program of Cdk posttranslational modification and cyclin expression and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heim et al., 2017</xref>). The G1 to S phase transition occurs when mitogenic stimulation leads to activation of the Cdk4/6-cyclin D complex, which acts to dissociate the E2F1 transcription factor from the Dp1 and Retinoblastoma (Rb) proteins, leading to E2F1 activation. E2F1 turns on key S phase genes, notably cyclins E and A2 and DNA synthesis factors. Cyclin E binding leads to activation of Cdk2. Then Cdk2, coupled to cyclin A2 (which further phosphorylates E2F1) initiates entry into and controls progression through S phase and the twin events of centriole and DNA duplicationÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hinchcliffe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lacey et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matsumoto et al., 1999</xref>). The precise events that link the cell cycle machinery to centriole duplication are not yet clear, however, many regulators localize to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kodani et al., 2015</xref>) and may control Plk4 stability and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korzeniewski et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, recent insights into MCC differentiation revealed that multiple cell cycle regulators also play important roles in motile ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meunier and Azimzadeh, 2016</xref>). The initiation of the MCC gene expression program depends on a transcriptional complex (EMD complex) comprising the E2F4 or E2F5 transcription factor, a Geminin family transcriptional activator (Mcidas or Gmnc) and Dp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). This complex is highly similar in make up to the E2F1/Rb/Dp1 complex that controls G1 to S phase progression, which suggests the existence of universal cell cycle regulatory mechanisms to create a permissive environment for centriole assembly. Downstream of EMD, the Myb and p73 transcription factors, also well known for their cell cycle functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allocati et al., 2012</xref>), turn on further MCC genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, the G2 to M phase cell cycle machinery, including Cdk1 was shown regulate intermediate stages of ciliogenesis in ependymal MCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Jord et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the extent to which the G1 to S phase cell cycle machinery is involved in motile ciliogenesis, we tested the role of Cdk2 using primary mouse tracheal epithelial cell (MTEC) culture, which recapitulates basal (stem) cell proliferation and subsequent MCC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">You et al., 2002</xref>). Here, we show that downstream of MCC fate acquisition, Cdk2 is required to initiate and maintain the MCC gene expression program during ciliogenesis. Consistently, MCCs driven to differentiate in the absence of Cdk2 activity fail to undergo ciliogenesis. Unlike in dividing cells, Cdk2 appears to function during ciliogenesis together with Cyclin A1 (Ccna1), a cognate cyclin thought to activate Cdk2 in meiotic cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>). In sum, our results indicate that Cdk2 activity is universal regulator of centriole assembly, and the involvement of Ccna1, a noncanonical binding partner in somatic cells, and likely other factors enable it to function in a postmitotic cell and drive centriole amplification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cyclin-dependent kinase activity is required for motile ciliogenesis</title><p>We used the MTEC culture system to test the requirement for Cdk activity during MCC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). MTECs are a faithful model of airway epithelial development and regeneration and permit the observation and manipulation of both the proliferative and differentiation phases of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">You et al., 2002</xref>). At maturity, MTECs contain all the cell types of the donor tissue, including MCCs, secretory cells and basal stem cells. The cultures are initiated by seeding basal stem cells isolated from mouse trachea onto porous Transwell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vladar and Brody, 2013</xref>). Cells proliferate to confluence while submerged in medium, then are lifted to an air-liquid interface (ALI) which promotes the differentiation of airway epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Culture progression follows a timeline in which basal cells proliferate during days 1â3, the resulting confluent cell layer acquires a columnar, apically compacted morphology from days 3â5, ALI is created on day 5 (ALIÂ +Â 0 days), and MTECs are mature by ALIÂ +Â 14 d with MCCs and secretory cells at the luminal surface with underlying basal cells. MCC fate acquisition and motile ciliogenesis occur asynchronously in both the in vivo airway epithelium and in MTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vladar and Stearns, 2007</xref>), but early ALI cultures are strongly enriched for MCCs in the initial stages of motile ciliogenesis.</p><p>To test the requirement for Cdk activity, we treated differentiating MTECs with well-characterized, dose-dependent small molecule inhibitors that predominantly act on Cdk1 and Cdk2 (Cdkis). We verified the previously established ability of these Cdkis to produce cell cycle arrest in 293T/17 cells before using in MTECs (not shown). MTECs were treated from ALIÂ +Â 0 to ALIÂ +Â 4 d (chronic treatment) with the Cdkis Purvalanol A, Roscovitine, NU6140 and Cdk2 Inhibitor III, then labeled at ALIÂ +Â 4 d with anti-acetylated Î±-Tubulin (ac. Î±-Tub) antibody to mark cilia. While untreated cultures contained many MCCs, we found that all four Cdkis blocked ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). To characterize this phenotype, we labeled cells with antibodies against structural and regulatory components of the ciliogenesis pathway, and found that Cdki treated MTECs failed to form centrioles (ac. Î±-Tub, Odf2, Pericentrin, Sass6, and Plk4), deuterosomes (Ccdc67, also known as Deup1) or ciliary axonemes (ac. Î±-Tub), indicating an early ciliogenesis arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâB</xref>). Motile ciliogenesis is initiated and maintained by the expression of ciliary genes via the sequential activity of MCC transcription factors (MCC TFs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meunier and Azimzadeh, 2016</xref>). We found that Cdki treated cells did not express the MCC TFs Foxj1 and Myb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using qRT-PCR, untreated cells showed strong upregulation of both MCC TFs and ciliary genes at ALIÂ +Â 4 d compared to confluent, but not yet differentiating cells (ALI-1d or day 4 of culture), whereas Cdki treated cells had no detectable levels of MCC TFs and ciliary genes were not upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Cdki treatment therefore blocks motile ciliogenesis at an early step of the pathway at the level of MCC gene expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36375.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chronic Cdk inhibitor treatment blocks motile ciliogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â MTECs were treated with NU6140 from ALIÂ +Â 0 to 4d.

Future MCCs then undergo motile ciliogenesis by amplifying centrioles to build motile cilia for airway clearance.Â (<bold>B</bold>) Future MCCs and secretory cells are selected out in a Notch-dependent manner such that the future secretory cell expresses the Notch receptor and activates the Notch pathway, whereas future MCCs do not experience Notch activation, but express ligand. Downstream of the Notch signaling event, nascent MCCs undergo the motile ciliogenesis pathway. During Stage I, MCCs launch the MCC gene expression program to express regulatory and structural ciliary genes, which build up in the cytoplasm (grey shapes). The MCC transcriptional program is controlled by the primary EMD complex, which turns on multiple secondary transcription factors. At Stage I, MCCs also briefly possess a primary cilium. During Stage II, cells generate hundreds of centrioles in the cytoplasm, which then traffic to and dock with the apical plasma membrane during Stage III. Stage IV represents a mature MCC in which centrioles act as basal bodies and elongate the motile ciliary axoneme. Centrioles, yellow cylinders; axonemes, blue rods.Â (<bold>C</bold>) The MTEC system faithfully models the establishment of the multiciliated airway epithelium. Progenitor basal cells are isolated by protease digestion from adult mouse tracheas and seeded onto porous Transwell membranes. Basal cells proliferate under submerged conditions. After they have formed a confluent, postmitotic columnar epithelium, the air-liquid interface (ALI) is created by supplying medium only from the basal compartment of the culture vessel.

MTECs treated with DAPT alone had a two-fold increase in MCCs compared to untreated cells as more cells evaded Notch activation and remained in the MCC pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, DAPT treatment was not able to induce MCCs in the presence of NU6140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that even cells directed toward the MCC fate by Notch inhibition still require Cdk2 activation to continue this progression. Because the Notch decision point occurs before Cdk2 activation, we refer to Cdk2 activation as acting âdownstreamâ of the Notch decision, although strictly speaking, it is peculiar to argue that Cdk2 activation acts downstream of something that does not occur (Notch signaling).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36375.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cdk2 acts downstream of Notch signaling and upstream of the MCC gene expression program.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â MTECs were treated with NU6140 and/or DAPT from ALIÂ +Â 0 to 4d.

TRRAP nuclear expression arises in prospective MCCs prior to Foxj1 expression. We asked whether TRRAP might act downstream of Cdk2 by assessing TRRAP expression in Cdki treated MTECs. We found that while Nu6140 treated MTECs lacked Foxj1+Â MCCs, they contained as many TRRAP+Â cells as untreated MTECs at the same stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This indicates that in prospective MCCs, TRRAP does not act downstream of Cdk2 activation. Cdk2 therefore acts either downstream of or in parallel to TRRAP in the initiation of the MCC gene expression program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, the appearance of TRRAP expression in the absence of Cdk2 activity indicates the adoption of the MCC cell fate, thus separating Cdk2 activity from the MCC cell fate decision.</p><p>Next, we more closely investigated the relationship between Cdk2 and the MCC transcriptional regulators Mcidas, Myb and Foxj1. While the precise hierarchy remains unclear, Mcidas (as part of the EMD complex) is known act upstream of the other two, but there is also evidence for feedback regulation and overlap in targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</xref>). As MCC TFs are repressed by Cdki treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we asked if they can function downstream of Cdk2 to drive ciliogenesis when expressed ectopically in the presence of Cdki treatment. MTECs infected at d3 of culture with lentivirus containing the MCC TF Mcidas, then treated with NU6140 from ALIÂ +Â 0 to 4d were able to carry out the complete motile ciliogenesis pathway as judged by Foxj1 expression and the presence of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Cultures expressing Myb or Foxj1 under these conditions did not undergo ciliogenesis. NU6140 treated cells expressing Foxj1 had nuclear or nucleo-cytoplasmic Foxj1 signal, but never made cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggests that Cdk2 acts upstream of Mcidas and raises the possibility that Mcidas or one of its binding partners may be a target of Cdk2. Consistent with previous reports, the expression of Mcidas and Myb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stubbs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan et al., 2013</xref>), but not Foxj1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">You et al., 2004</xref>), was sufficient to drive motile ciliogenesis in untreated MTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Our results place the Cdk2 requirement downstream of the Notch-dependent cell fate decision and upstream of EMD in the MCC gene expression pathway for initiating ciliogenesis. The clear temporal separation of the proliferation (preALI) and differentiation (beginning at ALIÂ +Â 0 d) phases of the MTEC culture system already made it unlikely that the ciliogenesis block by Cdki treatment starting at ALIÂ +Â 0 d stems from the disruption of a proliferative event. The fact that Cdk2 acts downstream of the Notch signaling event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) indicates that Cdki blocked cells have exited the cell cycle and undergone MCC fate selection, reinforcing the conclusion drawn from TRRAP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) in these cells. Identifying Cdk2 as an upstream regulator of the MCC transcriptional program fills an important gap in knowledge for this process and further cements a universal role for the cell cycle machinery in centriole generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cdk2 is required to sustain the MCC gene expression program</title><p>Although understanding of the regulatory hierarchy of the program is still emerging, MCC gene expression appears to be a protracted, multi-step process with early and later transcriptional steps driving the sequential execution of cilium biogenesis events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meunier and Azimzadeh, 2016</xref>). Results presented thus far indicate that Cdk2 activates MCC gene expression. To test if it is also required for the sustained expression of ciliary genes, we treated MTECs after the onset of ciliogenesis, from ALIÂ +Â 3 to ALIÂ +Â 4 d, with NU6140 (acute treatment). Acute Cdki treatment resulted in an immediate ciliogenesis arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>), indicating that Cdk2 is not only required to initiate, but also to sustain the pathway. To characterize the Cdki arrest, we used centriole markers (Î³-Tubulin and Odf2) to quantitate the fraction of MCCs at different stages of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vladar and Stearns, 2007</xref>).

We found that Cdki treatment blocked this transition and cells arrested at all stages of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>).

Thus, the relative expression of these two MCC TFs can be used to monitor ciliogenesis progression. In untreated MTECs, we consistently detected a decrease in Myb+/Foxj1- and the increase in Myb-/Foxj1Â +cells from ALIÂ +Â 3 to 4d by antibody labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). However, we did not detect a statistically significant decrease in the Myb+/Foxj1- population and the Myb-/Foxj1+Â population failed to increase under Cdki treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that cells failed to progress in the ciliogenesis pathway.

We do not distinguish whether ciliogenesis arrests due to impairment of a signal or due to the depletion of ciliogenic components, although arrest is evident at the level of the transcriptional network.

Interestingly, we found that HA-Cdk2 also localized to centrioles in both ciliating and mature MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As we were not able to observe endogenous Cdk2 at MCC centrioles due to the lack of effective antibodies, we could not confirm that this centriolar localization of ectopically expressed Cdk2 is representative of endogenous Cdk2 distribution.

Here, we show that Cdk2, the key regulator of cell cycle entry and centrosome and DNA duplication in S phase is responsible for activation of the MCC gene expression program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), further supporting the notion that an alternative cell cycle program controls MCC differentiation. Seeking to understand how differentiated MCCs can overcome the strict regulatory limits on centriole duplication that exist in cycling cells to generate hundreds of centrioles, we tested the requirement for Cdk2 during motile ciliogenesis. We found that it is required for initiating and sustaining the MCC gene expression program, and that it likely works together with Ccna1. These results uncover surprising roles for both Cdk2 and Ccna1 in a quiescent somatic cell, further establish the role of cell cycle regulators in motile ciliogenesis, and suggest that centriole generation and number control are regulated by common cell cycle-associated mechanisms in which MCC-specific alterations can drive amplification.</p><p>Centriole generation is normally restricted to the S phase of the cell cycle. The involvement of multiple cell cycle-related proteins in the motile ciliogenesis pathway led to the hypothesis that MCCs enter a unique cell cycle state, the so called S* phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan et al., 2013</xref>) that shares characteristics with both cycling and quiescent states and simultaneously facilitates both centriole generation and maintenance of a postmitotic state. Thus, we speculated that Cdk2, the regulator of S phase entry may be involved in ciliogenesis. We report that Cdk2 is localized to the nucleus in ciliating MCCs, and that Cdk2 inhibition arrests the pathway at its earliest known step, the initiation of the MCC gene expression program. Nuclear localization is consistent with an active kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pagano et al., 1993</xref>) and a role in regulating MCC transcription.</p><p>MCC TFs represent attractive candidate substrates for Cdk2 during ciliogenesis. Such a direct action mechanism would be consistent with both the lack of transcriptional activation under Cdki treatment and with known functions of Cdk2 in dividing cells. Cdk2-Ccne1 propels cells towards S phase, in part, by phosphorylating the Rb protein, which maintains the E2F1 transcription factor in an inactive complex with Dp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heim et al., 2017</xref>). Related complexes, comprising E2F4/5, Dp1 and a Geminin family member (Geminin, Mcidas and Gmnc) act early during ciliogenesis to turn on MCC gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vladar and Mitchell, 2016</xref>). Recent studies on the role of the Geminin family proteins in MCCs suggest that Geminin is initially complexed with E2F4/5 and Dp1 to inhibit ciliogenesis; subsequently, complexes that include Mcidas and Gmnc emerge to turn on ciliary genes. We favor the hypothesis that this process is regulated by Cdk2 phosphorylation of one or more of these complex components. E2F5 is a known Cdk2 target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morris et al., 2000</xref>), and studies are underway to test whether this interaction occurs during ciliogenesis.</p><p>Our results raise a number of fascinating questions about Cdk2 specifically and about cell cycle regulation in general. How does Cdk2 become active in a quiescent cell? How does Cdk2 activation in MCCs not lead to cell cycle reentry or to DNA replication? We hypothesize that Cdk2 activation during ciliogenesis occurs in the proposed S* phase that shares characteristics with both G1 and S. Moreover, we propose that events downstream of Cdk2 activation are modular and subject to MCC-specific regulation to allow centriole amplification without DNA replication or cell cycle progression. As the key regulator of the G1 to S phase transition in cycling cells, Cdk2 activity is under a multitude of regulatory constraints, and our results indicate that some of these regulatory events are also active in MCCs. We demonstrated that Cdk2 bearing the activating Thr160 phosphorylation peaks around the time of ciliogenesis initiation in MTECs. In dividing cells, this modification is imparted by Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) downstream of cyclin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeffrey et al., 1995</xref>), and it is essential for the G1 to S phase transition. In the future, we will test the potential activity and role of additional Cdk2 regulatory measures, including the removal of the inhibitory Thr14 and Tyr15 phosphorylations by the Cdc25A phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our data point to the involvement of Ccna1 as a cognate cyclin to Cdk2 in motile ciliogenesis regulation based on its MCC restricted expression, colocalization with Cdk2 and the finding of diminished MCCs in the <italic>Ccna1</italic> mutant mice. Although technical limitations (the inability to sort ciliating cells from heterogeneous cultures, and the small culture size) prevent us from demonstrating direct association in ciliating cells, their colocalization during ciliogenesis, similar loss of function phenotypes and the existence of Cdk2-Ccna1 complexes in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>) are consistent with Ccna1 binding to activate Cdk2 to control ciliogenesis. Finally, we show that Cdk2 and Ccna1 are both enriched in nuclei of ciliating but not mature MCCs. Of note, Ccna1 regulates meiosis in mammals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">d'Erfurth et al., 2010</xref>), another event in which centrioles are generated in the absence of DNA replication.</p><p>We demonstrate that <italic>Ccna1</italic> is a target of multiple MCC transcription factors, which accounts for its sustained and robust expression during ciliogenesis. As we propose that Ccna1 acts together with Cdk2 to initiate the MCC gene expression program, it remains to be understood how <italic>Ccna1</italic> gets turned at the onset of ciliogenesis. By analogy to cell cycle progression, we speculate that Ccna1 may be degraded at or near the conclusion of motile ciliogenesis, possibly as a regulatory step in the pathway. Our inability to detect Ccna1 by antibody labeling in mature MCCs raises the possibility of a regulated cyclin destruction event, which requires closer examination. <italic>Ccna1</italic> mice showed a reduction in MCC number but not the complete block to ciliogenesis observed with Cdki treatment. The different phenotypes could represent different responses to a chronic loss of Ccna1 in vivo compared to the acute inhibition of Cdk activity in vitro. We also speculate that it may be due to partial redundancy with other cyclins. In spite of its broader expression and the lack of an MCC phenotype, we cannot rule out a role for Ccne1. Recent studies identified Ccno as an important regulator of ciliogenesis downstream of the EMD complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wallmeier et al., 2014</xref>), and although it is not known whether Ccno can activate Cdk2, it could conceivably also act partially redundantly with Ccna1.</p><p>We consistently observed Cdk2 at centrioles in both MTECs and in human ALI cultures (unpublished results). Cdks, including Cdk2, have been reported at the centrosome in dividing cells, so this is likely a localization pattern shared with MCCs. Centrosomal Cdk2 targets include Ccp110, which dissociates from the mother centriole distal end upon phosphorylation to allow primary cilium growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Ccp110 is present and required for motile ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Song et al., 2014</xref>), and the centriolar pool of Cdk2 may be regulating motile axoneme elongation in MCCs. Nucleophosmin 1 (Npm1), a Cdk2 substrate that shows both nuclear and centriolar localization, has been suggested as a link between Cdk2 activity and centrosome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okuda et al., 2000</xref>). Although we can detect Npm1 in MCCs (unpublished results), its role in ciliogenesis remains untested. We note that forced expression of Mcidas in the presence of inhibited Cdk2 can sustain ciliogenesis, suggesting that putative Cdk2 activity at replicating centrioles may not be absolutely required.</p><p>Our results, and the analogy between the G1 to S phase transition and motile ciliogenesis, indicate that Cdk2 is a common regulator of the two processes, however, it is important to consider the possibility of redundant factors and mechanisms. The near normal viability of the <italic>Cdk2</italic> knockout mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berthet et al., 2003</xref>) revealed that other Cdks and Cdk-independent events are capable of driving cell cycle progression, at least in the context of chronic Cdk2 absence. Similarly, we cannot rule out the contribution of other Cdks to motile ciliogenesis. Cdk4 and Cdk6 play important roles in G1 exit and should be investigated in MCCs. Our Cdkis likely do not inhibit Cdk4/6 at the concentrations we employed, but some might conceivably target Cdk5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peyressatre et al., 2015</xref>). Although Cdk5 is not a canonical cell cycle regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shupp et al., 2017</xref>), we cannot exclude that it has a role in motile ciliogenesis.</p><p>The Cdk1-APC/C mitotic oscillator was recently shown to promote intermediate phases of centriole replication in MCCs without stimulating mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Jord et al., 2017</xref>). We demonstrate that Cdk2 plays a role in initiating the MCC gene expression program, the precursor to centriole assembly. We support our placement of Cdk2 at this point in the regulatory hierarchy by demonstrating that it acts downstream of the Notch signaling event and either downstream of, or in parallel with, TRRAP, an early regulator of ciliogenesis, and upstream of the EMD complex that initiates and sustains MCC gene expression. In addition to its nuclear localization, we observe Cdk2 at centrioles, and thus we cannot rule out that, similar to Cdk1, it is also involved more directly in ciliogenesis. Cdk1 and Cdk2 redundancy at centrioles may explain why we did not detect a ciliogenesis phenotype with the Cdk1-specific RO3306 inhibitor as observed by Al Jord <italic>et al</italic>. As that study was chiefly carried out in ependymal MCCs, which make many fewer MCCs, it may also reflect an alternative Cdk requirement.</p><p>We set out to increase our understanding about how MCCs are able to break the rules of centriole assembly and number control faithfully observed by dividing cells. In sum, our results show that Cdk2 activity is required to create a permissive environment for centriole generation in either context. Emerging studies point to the involvement of universal centriole assembly factors and events, including common regulators and biogenesis steps, and MCC-specific features, like the use of deuterosomes and transcriptional regulation. We add the universal requirement for Cdk2 activity to this model, and underscore the importance of cell cycle regulation to centriole assembly in any context. It will be interesting to compare MCC mechanisms to those operating in other cells with alternative cell cycles or where DNA and centriole duplication are uncoupled. These include male germ cells in which meiosis is regulated by Cdk2-Ccna1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 1998</xref>) and endocycling cells that undergo many rounds of DNA replication without mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu and Roy, 2014</xref>). With growing attention to MCCs in various tissues, improved understanding of the motile ciliogenesis pathway is an important goal.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse husbandry and MTEC culture</title><p>C57BL/6J (IMSR Cat# JAX:000664, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link>) mice were obtained from JAX. <italic>Ccna1</italic> (MGI Cat# 2657243, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2657243">MGI:2657243</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 1998</xref>), <italic>Ccne1; Ccne2</italic> (MGI Cat# 2675493, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2675493">MGI:2675493</ext-link>, gift from Peter Sicinski, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geng et al., 2003</xref>) and <italic>Foxj1-EGFP</italic> (IMSR Cat# JAX:010827, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:010827">IMSR_JAX:010827</ext-link>, gift from Larry Ostrowski, UNC Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ostrowski et al., 2003</xref>) mice have been previously described. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Stanford University School of Medicine in accordance with established guidelines for animal care. MTEC culture and lentiviral infection were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vladar and Brody, 2013</xref>). In short, tracheas were isolated and incubated overnight in Pronase solution to release epithelial cells. Cells were seeded onto 24, 12 or 6 well size Transwell filters (Corning) and cultured submerged in proliferation medium until confluence. The air-liquid interface (ALI) was created by adding differentiation medium to only the bottom compartment of the culture dish. Cells were treated at ALI with 10 Î¼M Roscovitine, 5 Î¼M Purvalanol A, 10 Î¼M NU6140, 10 Î¼M Cdk2 Inhibitor III, 1 Î¼M RO3306 (all from Tocris) and 1 Î¼M DAPT (Abcam) in differentiation medium for various lengths of time. MTECs are fed fresh medium with or without drugs every two days.</p><p>Lentiviral vectors containing myc-Mcidas, Foxj1 and Myb have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). Lentiviral vectors containing human Cdk2-HA and Cdk2<sup>D145N</sup>-HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van den Heuvel and Harlow, 1993</xref>) were generated by transferring the Cdk2-HA open reading frames into the BamHI site of the pRRL.sin-18.PPT.PGK.pre lentiviral vector using PCR. The GFP-Ccna1/a2/e1 and e2 constructs were generated by PCR amplifying and inserting the cyclin open reading frames, obtained by RT-PCR from MTEC or NIH/3T3 cell cDNA, into the AgeI or BamHI site of the pRRL.sin-18.PPT.PGK.GFP.pre lentiviral vector to create a C-terminal GFP fusion. Lentivirus was prepared according to published methods using the psPAX2 and pMD2.G helper plasmids (Addgene) in the 293T/17 cell line (see below). MTECs were infected with lentivirus on day three of culture (ALI-2d) using spin infection following EGTA treatment to temporarily disrupt epithelial junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vladar and Brody, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>293T/17 (ATCC Cat# CRL-11268, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1926">CVCL_1926</ext-link>) cells were used for lentiviral preparation and the Luciferase and endogenous gene activation assays. mIMCD3 (ATCC Cat# CRL-2123, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0429">CVCL_0429</ext-link>) cells were used to test Ccna1 antibody specificity.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Steven Brody (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The manuscript submitted by Vladar and colleagues reports a novel role for the canonical mitotic regulator Cdk2 in the control of ciliogenesis in murine airway culture systems. They claim that Cdk2 is required to initiate and maintain the MCC gene expression program during ciliogenesis. They claim that Cdk2 is coupled with cyclin A1 to initiate centriole replication in MCCs. The authors begin by assessing the effects of pharmacologic Cdk inhibitors on differentiating MTEC ALI cultures, observing that inhibition of Cdk2 produces a reversible block in the initiation ciliogenesis revealed by the absence of MCC markers by immunofluorescence imaging. The specificity of this result was established with a dominant-negative allele of Cdk2, which phenocopies pharmacologic inhibition. Subsequent data suggests ongoing Cdk2 activity (after initiation of ciliogenesis) is also required for MCCs to complete maturation into &quot;Stage IV&quot; or Foxj1+/Myb- cells. In order to establish epistasis relationships, MTEC ALI were treated simultaneously with Cdk2 inhibitors and the Notch antagonist DAPT or with Cdk2 inhibitors in the setting of enforced Mcidas expression. The claim is that these experiments place Cdk2 downstream of Notch and upstream of Mcidas in specifying MCCs. In order to identify the cellular compartment in which Cdk2 functions, tagged overexpressed Cdk2 was localized at ALI+4d, a timepoint at which both mature and ciliating MCCs are present. The authors claim nuclear exclusion of HA-Cdk2 in mature (but not ciliating) MCCs and go on to co-localize HA-Cdk2 to the centriolar compartment. In order to identify the cognate cyclin with which Cdk2 associates during MCC development, the authors utilize qRT-PCR and note the potent induction of Ccna1 during the mid-ciliogenesis stage specifically in MCCs (defined here by Foxj1 expression). Reporter assays and endogenous qRT-PCR experiments upon enforced overexpression of MCC transcription factors suggest Ccna1 can be induced by E2F4 in the presence of Mcidas. The authors next examine the localization of ectopic and native Ccna1, concluding Ccna1 is nuclear localized during ciliogenesis and subsequently undetectable or nucleocytoplasmic in mature MCCs. Given the similarity of this pattern to that previously observed for Cdk2, they argue for the function of Cdk2/Ccna1 as a physically interacting complex. In the final series of experiments the authors demonstrate the in vivo importance of Ccna1 in ciliogenesis by examining the airways of previously generated <italic>Ccna1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>All the reviewers agree that there is broad general interest in these findings. It is clear that Cdk2/Ccna1 are important regulators of airway ciliogenesis. The data are convincing that Cdk inhibitors interfere with both processes: centriologenesis and cilia formation. This is an important contribution. However, there are substantive concerns that need to be addressed about the interpretation and mechanism and the various steps of ciliogenesis and maintenance that are affected by Cdk2.</p><p>Major Concerns that must be addressed:</p><p>1) The actual role of Cdk2 in ciliated cell formation, ciliogenesis, and cilia maintenance per se is unclear. They need to clarify effects on cell fate specification and ciliogenesis and ciliated cell maintenance. Is Cdk2 directing specifically the initiation and (perhaps) maintenance of MCC centriologenesis or is there a broader role in the (co-)regulation of other steps of cilia assembly. A specific role in centriole replication needs to be clear. It may be that there are biological or technical limitation such that a failure of initiation of centriole amplification halts the entire subsequent program of ciliogenesis, this may be difficult to prove in a revision. However, the apparent later stage role of Ccna1, after centriologenesis, seems contradictory to the proposal that Cdk2-Ccna1 are regulating centriole replication and needs to be resolved. There might be some experimental limitations that cannot fully separate the roles of Cdk2 in regulating ciliated cell formation and centriologenesis. But the authors need to clarify the specific roles of Cdk in either dilated cell formation or centriologenesis and also discuss these limitations in the paper</p><p>2) The links between the celluar localization of Cdk2, the activation of Cdk2, and the expression of MCC TFs are inconclusive. It is difficult to appreciate the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling during ciliogenesis. In Figure 4, nuclear vs cytoplasmic lysates would be better than this IF (which isn't convincing for nuclear exclusion). One could immunoprecipitate tagged Cdk2 from nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments at various timepoints and show Ccna1 blots?</p><p>3) The experimental evidence is not sufficient to support that CdK2 acts downstream of Notch signaling. The authors cannot exclude the possibility that Cdk2 and Notch signaling function parallel but share the same downstream consequence.</p><p>Requirements for revision:</p><p>1) The authors should provide additional evidence that Cdk2 acts downstream of Notch signaling, rather than in a parallel pathway. A further assessment of the components of Notch signaling might be one approach.</p><p>2) The authors should provide more convincing evidence of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling with the HA-Cdk2, in control, basal cells and in cells undergoing centriologenesis and ciliogenesis. Identification of the fusion protein in Isolated nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions could be performed.</p><p>3) Biochemical evidence of the interaction of Cdk2 with Ccna2 in cyotoplasmic fractions during specific stages of centriologenesis and/or cilia assembly. Related to this strengthen evidence regarding the relationship of HA-Cdk2 and components of centrioles (biochemically or by IF).</p><p>4) A better characterization of pT160 Cdk2 to identify which specific stages of MCC differentiation are associated with this activity. For example, is there coincident biochemical evidence of high levels of the massive centriole replication (and the presence of other markers of centriologenesis) or it later, post centriole replication/docking and instead coincident with cilia assembly? Or, during both processes?</p><p>5) There are several relatively minor points that ought to be addressed related to clarifying the use of specific parameters in graphs, providing statistics, controls for western blots, and quantifying ciliated vs non-ciliated cells in Ccna1 ko mice.</p><p>6) Finally, the last four paragraphs of the Discussion could be condensed since it is speculation and not directly focused on the data. I think that one major emphasis of the discussion should be a comparison to Al Jord et al., 2017, who show that Cdk1 (rather than Cdk2) in balance with APC is required for centriole amplification-ciliation and inhibition of mitosis, respectively. The Vlader discussion should further explain why Al Jord implicates Cdk1 and Vlader Cdk2 beyond what is written in paragraph two. The authors should discuss specifically if they believe that their data indicate that Cdk2 is directly a program or has specific protein targets, these issues are discussed loosely in paragraphs three, four and five. Consider inhibition of APC and examine Cdk2-dependent centriole amplification, this would address the discussion point in paragraph six.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36375.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Concerns that must be addressed:</p><p>1) The actual role of Cdk2 in ciliated cell formation, ciliogenesis, and cilia maintenance per se is unclear.

But the authors need to clarify the specific roles of Cdk in either dilated cell formation or centriologenesis and also discuss these limitations in the paper</p></disp-quote><p>This is a complex multi-part question, which we attempt to break down and address systematically.</p><p>First, it is apparent that we failed to adequately convey the currently accepted understanding of these events. We hope that the following is a clearer description of the events and regulation of cell fate specification, motile ciliogenesis and cilium maintenance during multiciliated cell (MCC) differentiation. To amend the manuscript, we have added two new schematics to Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 (new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A-B), updated Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C and Figure 7B (now 7C) and clarified the text in the Introduction as well as the Discussion.</p><p>To summarize: upon airway epithelialization, MCC and secretory cell fates are acquired in a Notch signaling-dependent mechanism. Cells in which Notch signaling is activated are diverted to the secretory cell fate, whereas cells in which Notch is not activated differentiate into MCCs. Therefore, it is the <underline>absence</underline> of Notch signaling that leads to the MCC fate. We note that typically, Notch signaling entails a feedback, in which neighboring cells emerge as either Notch expressing cells, in which Notch is activated (here, the secretory cells), or ligand expressing cells, in which Notch is not activated (here, the MCCs). In the prospective MCCs in which Notch is not activated, it appears that MCC differentiation is a default occurrence, though we cannot rule out that some additional initiating event is required that might or might not be linked to having expressed ligand.</p><p>Thus, the first key point that we make is that the idea of being downstream of an ABSENCE of another event (the Notch signal) is a bit slippery. If having expressed the ligand, or receiving another signal, is not necessarily required, one might alternately describe this scenario as the progenitors retaining a pre-existing MCC fate unless they are diverted to the secretory fate through Notch activation. Of note, published data suggest that cells diverted to the secretory fate can be transdifferentiated back to the MCC fate by inhibiting Notch, indicating that the potential to become an MCC is not eliminated, but rather is merely suppressed, by ongoing Notch signaling. Because the opportunity to divert to the secretory cell fate exists prior to MCC differentiation (see below), we choose to retain the language existing in the literature of MCC fate occurring âdownstreamâ of Notch signaling, while expressing this caveat in the amended text.</p><p>The second key point is that the entire morphogenetic program of MCC differentiation, including not only centriologenesis, but all the subsequent events including docking, axonemogenesis, and likely numerous other events, are driven by the activation of a MCC-specific transcriptional complex comprised of E2F4/5, Mcidas and DP1 (the EMD complex) to initiate and drive motile ciliogenesis. EMD turns on multiple other secondary transcription factors (including Myb, Rfx3 and Foxj1) and they cooperate to turn on hundreds of structural and regulatory ciliary genes. This leads to activation of the motile cilium biogenesis pathway, which consists of centriole amplification followed by centriole apical transport and membrane docking and then axoneme elongation. These transcription factors are expressed throughout differentiation, and most (with the exception of Foxj1 and possibly Foxn4) are downregulated only after differentiation is complete. Therefore, activating the EMD complex, a step requiring Cdk2, drives not just centriologenesis, but the entirety of the differentiation program. Ciliogenesis is a linear pathway, and a failure to initiate centriole assembly will absolutely preclude subsequent steps in the ciliogenesis program. This in itself does not distinguish between an initiation and a maintenance function for Cdk2. However, our result showing that cells in which Cdk2 is inhibited after the centriole replication has begun nonetheless are arrested in differentiation (Figure 3C) demonstrates an ongoing requirement for Cdk2 <underline>in addition to</underline> a role in starting the process. This ongoing requirement may reflect a continuing transcriptional activity, but might also, or in addition, be associated with a more direct role of Cdk2 in a downstream process, a possibility suggested by the centriolar pool, for example. We suggest that investigation of the distinct pools of Cdk2 and roles other than initiating and sustaining MCC TF activity are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>With this conceptual framework in mind, we can address some specific queries:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is Cdk2 directing specifically the initiation and (perhaps) maintenance of MCC centriologenesis or is there a broader role in the (co-)regulation of other steps of cilia assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data support a role for Cdk2 in nascent MCCs (in the absence of, or âdownstream of,â the Notch signaling event) upstream of the EMD transcriptional complex. Because EMD drives the whole constellation of differentiation events, we propose that Cdk2 is required in nascent MCCs to initiate ciliogenesis. Our data noted above (Figure 3C) also supports an ongoing role for Cdk2 during differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the apparent later stage role of Ccna1, after centriologenesis, seems contradictory to the proposal that Cdk2-Ccna1 are regulating centriole replication and needs to be resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not view these roles as contradictory. Both centriole replication and subsequent events are dependent on EMD activation. As described above, both functions might be mediated by Cdk2-Ccna1 acting on EMD, or the later maintenance of ciliogenesis could potentially be mediated by non-transcriptional functions instead of, or in addition to, a transcriptional function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They need to clarify effects on cell fate specification and ciliogenesis and ciliated cell maintenance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new data, requested by the reviewers, that incidentally allows us to address this question more precisely. The new data (new Figures 2B and 7C) regards the role of Cdk2 in relation to TRRAP in this process. TRRAP, a histone deacetylase complex member (Wang et al., 2018) was identified as an early regulator of motile ciliogenesis and was shown to act in the nucleus to turn on the EMD complex downstream of (in the absence of) the Notch signaling event. We show that TRRAP expression is induced in the absence of Cdk activity, indicating that TRAPP functions either upstream of, or in parallel to, Cdk2 activation (see new Figure 7C). We allowed MTEC cultures to differentiate for four days in the presence of the Cdk inhibitor Nu6140. As shown before, these cultures are not able to initiate EMD activity and undergo motile ciliogenesis. However Nu6140 treatment had no effect on the cellsâ ability to turn on nuclear TRRAP expression. Thus, we while Cdk2 is required to initiate ciliogenesis, we can conclude it is not involved in the MCC fate decision as evidenced by the expression of TRRAP even in the absence of Cdk2 activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There might be some experimental limitations that cannot fully separate the roles of Cdk2 in regulating ciliated cell formation and centriologenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We presume here that the reviewer means distinguishing initiation of the differentiation program from a specific and direct function in centriologenesis. Indeed, answering this question would require biochemical analyses to complement the genetic manipulations performed thus far. As described in our response to point 2 below, the asynchrony of differentiation and the limiting amounts of material render these types of studies infeasible. In case we are interpreting the comment incorrectly, and the reviewer means separating the roles of Cdk2 in MCC cell fate specification versus centriologenesis, we argue that the TRRAP result shows that Cdk2 is not required for acquisition of the MCC cell fate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The links between the celluar localization of Cdk2, the activation of Cdk2, and the expression of MCC TFs are inconclusive. It is difficult to appreciate the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling during ciliogenesis. In Figure 4, nuclear vs cytoplasmic lysates would be better than this IF (which isn't convincing for nuclear exclusion). One could immunoprecipitate tagged Cdk2 from nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments at various timepoints and show Ccna1 blots?</p></disp-quote><p>Two ideas appear to be embedded in this comment. First, âThe links between the cellular localization of Cdk2, the activation of Cdk2, and the expression of MCC TFs are inconclusive.â An abundance of prior data establishes that Cdk2 activation and its nuclear localization (and phosphorylation) are coincident. We have shown that its activity is required for EMD complex (MCC TF) activation, and we demonstrate the correlated nuclear localization and Thr160 phosphorylation of Cdk2. These conclusions are based on inhibitor and dominant negative studies, IF assays of nuclear localization (newly quantitated, as described below) and immunoblotting. Thus, the requirement for Cdk2 to activate EMD, and the markers of active Cdk2 are conclusive.</p><p>We acknowledge that we do not demonstrate that the EMD complex (MCC TF) is a direct target of Cdk2, and that we provide only immunofluorescence evidence that Cdk2 (and Ccna1) (co)localize in the nucleus in ciliating MCCs. Technical limitations and the nature of MCC differentiation prevent us from addressing these questions biochemically. MTECs (as well as the in vivo airways) undergo MCC fate acquisition and motile ciliogenesis in a highly asynchronous manner (Figure 3). Although younger MTECs are more enriched for cells in the early stages of ciliogenesis and older MTECs contain mostly mature MCCs, MTECs at all times contain MCCs at different levels. Moreover, MTECs contain a large fraction of nonMCCs, which include basal stem cells and secretory cells (see new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C). Our data suggest that Cdk2-Ccna1 is required for ciliogenesis, but not in mature MCCs, and for <italic>Ccna1</italic> we specifically show that its expression is restricted to MCCs. This means that any biochemical fractionation or IP would require purification of MCCs in the process of ciliating from a complex cell population. We have the ability to FACS sort MCCs vs. nonMCCs using the <italic>Foxj1-EGFP</italic> mouse line (Vladar and Stearns, 2007), but this preferentially isolates mature MCCs and cannot distinguish between MCCs at different stages of ciliogenesis (see Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 3). There are currently no FACS markers specifically for ciliating MCCs or specific ciliogenesis stages. Finally, even if we could sort the desired cells, it is currently not technically feasible to scale up the MTEC culture (limited by the number of basal stem cells isolated from airway tissues) to produce a sufficient quantity of cell lysates for the required fractionation and IP experiments. Experiments from unsorted MTECs would not address these questions or would be impossible to interpret due to the presence of nonMCCs or mature MCCs. It is already well-known from work in other cells and tissues that Cdk2 can undergo nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and that it can interact with Ccna1. To add additional value to our manuscript, testing this specifically in ciliating MCCs would be required, but we are unable to isolate these cells.</p><p>âIt is difficult to appreciate the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling during ciliogenesis.â As we are left with only IF assays, we strengthened our observation of nuclear localization by providing careful quantitation of our Cdk2-HA localization in MTECs, the results of which support the presence of Cdk2 in the nucleus in ciliating, but not in mature MCCs (new Figure 4B).</p><p>In the manuscript, we are careful to temper our overall conclusions in this revision in light of these limitations. We hope it will be possible to address these points more fully as technology advances. However, the remarkable conservation of Cdk2 localization and function (nuclear localization, partnering with an A-type cyclin and acting on an E2F family TF containing transcriptional complex) between MCCs and cycling cells complements our data and strongly supports our proposed mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The experimental evidence is not sufficient to support that CdK2 acts downstream of Notch signaling. The authors cannot exclude the possibility that Cdk2 and Notch signaling function parallel but share the same downstream consequence.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, it is absence of Notch signaling that allows MCC differentiation. To reword the reviewerâs idea, s/he is asking whether Cdk2 might function in parallel and have common downstream consequences with the absence of Notch signaling. Said this way, the idea makes little sense. To reiterate, we argue that progenitors must both NOT have Notch activation, and have activated Cdk2. Since Notch activation suppresses MCC differentiation, temporally the Notch mediated event must occur prior to Cdk2 activation or no secretory cells would be produced. This idea is reinforced by the observation that TRRAP expression, an indicator of entering the MCC pathway (and therefore of having NOT been activated by Notch), occurs in the absence of Cdk2 activity (new Figure 2B). Thus, Notch signaling occurs before Cdk2 activation temporally, but strictly speaking, it is incorrect to say that absence of Notch signaling is upstream of Cdk2 activation.</p><p>The other challenging notion in this comment is that there is a downstream consequence of not being activated by Notch. As far as we know, the consequence might be to retain the same state that the cell was in prior to or in the absence of any Notch signaling at all.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Requirements for revision:</p><p>1) The authors should provide additional evidence that Cdk2 acts downstream of Notch signaling, rather than in a parallel pathway. A further assessment of the components of Notch signaling might be one approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the conceptual challenge in the idea of an activity being downstream of the absence of another signal has been adequately explained above. Strictly speaking, our data are consistent with a model in which both the absence of the Notch signal and the activation of Cdk2 are required in a given cell to promote the MCC fate. Because diversion to the secretory cell fate by Notch activity suppresses Cdk2 activation and the MCC fate, the decision about entering the secretory pathway (active Notch signaling) vs the MCC fate (absence of Notch signaling) must typically occur prior to activation of MCC TFs, and this (together with a lack of complete rigor) is probably the origin of the âupstreamâ and âdownstreamâ descriptors currently in the literature. We have attempted to convey this admittedly somewhat subtle concept both here and in the revised text (see also the new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A-B), but have chosen to keep the language of âupstreamâ and âdownstreamâ as shorthand.</p><p>Because it is absence of Notch signaling that is required for the MCC cell fate, investigating components of Notch signaling such as Notch intracellular domain (N-ICD) nuclear translocation and resulting gene expression would be relevant to the secretory cell rather than the MCC, and therefore not useful. We attempt to clarify the role of Notch signaling in MCC specification in the text as well as in the new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A-B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should provide more convincing evidence of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling with the HA-Cdk2, in control, basal cells and in cells undergoing centriologenesis and ciliogenesis. Identification of the fusion protein in Isolated nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions could be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, technical limitations and the nature of MCC differentiation prevent us from addressing Cdk2-HA nuclear vs. cytoplasmic enrichment using nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction lysates. Like the in vivo airway surface, MTECs contain MCCs and nonMCCs, and MCCs ciliate asynchronously; thus a bulk extract would contain nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from cells that would be expected to show multiple Cdk2 enrichment patterns (ciliating vs. mature cells) and thus make it impossible to interpret the results. As described above, we do not have the ability to isolate ciliating MCCs specifically due to the lack of appropriate FACS markers and the low number of these cells in our small scale primary cultures. To support our findings, we now provide quantitation of our Cdk2-HA subcellular localization in MTECs, and the results support the nuclear enrichment of Cdk2 in ciliating, but not in mature MCCs (new Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Biochemical evidence of the interaction of Cdk2 with Ccna2 in cyotoplasmic fractions during specific stages of centriologenesis and/or cilia assembly. Related to this strengthen evidence regarding the relationship of HA-Cdk2 and components of centrioles (biochemically or by IF).</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment requires demonstration that Cdk2 interacts with Ccna1 (we assume that the Reviewer/Editor is asking about Ccna1 and not Ccna2) specifically in ciliating MCCs. Cdk2 is already known to physically interact with Ccna1 based on work in other systems. However, the technical limitations preclude isolation of this sub-population of cells. We raise and discuss this limitation to our study in the discussion. Our hypothesized mechanism involving a Cdk2-Ccna1 complex in early ciliogenesis regulation is bolstered by analogy to a vast trove of exiting data from other studies that indicate that Cdk2 requires A or E-type cyclin binding for activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A better characterization of pT160 Cdk2 to identify which specific stages of MCC differentiation are associated with this activity. For example, is there coincident biochemical evidence of high levels of the massive centriole replication (and the presence of other markers of centrioliogenesis) or it later, post centriole replication/docking and instead coincident with cilia assembly? Or, during both processes?</p></disp-quote><p>Again, technical limitations do not permit the isolation of the specific cells necessary for a biochemical approach to this question. It might have been possible to address this using IF if the T160 Cdk2 antibody were effective in IF experiments. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain any immunofluorescence signal with the Cdk2 antibody using multiple fixation methods, suggesting either that the antibody does not work in IF experiments or it is not sufficiently sensitive for the amounts of phospho-Cdk2 expressed. Therefore, we are limited to inference from the increased pT160 Cdk2 signal in early ALI timepoints from bulk isolates that are strongly enriched for MCCs at the earliest stages of ciliogenesis that active Cdk2 is more abundant in these cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are several relatively minor points that ought to be addressed related to clarifying the use of specific parameters in graphs, providing statistics, controls for western blots, and quantifying ciliated vs non-ciliated cells in Ccna1 ko mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note: on 5/2/18 we requested and received the following clarifications on this point by email from Maria Guerreiro, Journal Development Editor<italic>, eLife:</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerning Figure 1C/Figure 4âfigure supplement 1, the label on the y-axis is not described in the figure legend and is vague. Is confluence of cells binary or quantified? Is this instead confluence/density of MCC? It doesn't change after ALI is established, so how the denominator changes during different stages is unclear. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>MTECs proliferate to confluence after about 3-4 days of submerged culture. Confluence is evaluated either visually (no membrane, only uninterrupted epithelial cell surface with cobblestone morphology visible) or it can be inferred from increased transepithelial electrical resistance as measured by an epithelial voltohmmeter. We changed the y-axis labels on both figures to ALI-1d (one day before ALI). The text indicates that this corresponds to a confluent, but not yet differentiating culture. We use cDNA from this time point as a comparison for MCC-related gene expression at later time points as it reflects an intact epithelium with no MCCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5A: the mRNA expression level of Ccna1 at the late ciliogenesis stage is higher than that at the early ciliogenesis stage. But the protein expression levels of Ccna1 in the Figure 5B show an opposite result.</p></disp-quote><p>We speculate that at the conclusion of ciliogenesis Ccna1 protein may be actively degraded. This is supported by our inability to detect it by immunofluorescence in individual mature MCCs (Figure 6B) and by analogy with data from other systems and processes that demonstrate that A-type cyclin levels are under strict control by gene expression as well as proteasomal degradation. MTEC lysates and cDNA preps from the three timepoints contain material from a complex mix of MCCs and nonMCCs, although the MCC fraction is enriched for cells at the early, mid and late stages of ciliogenesis. Late ciliogenesis samples also contain many mature and nearly mature MCCs, and it is possible that active degradation of Ccna1 in these cells results in the overall lower signal on the Western blot compared to the corresponding qPCR experiment. It is also possible that the cells that were used for protein lysate and cDNA prep contained a somewhat different proportion of MCCs vs. nonMCCs or ciliating (with higher Ccna1 gene and protein levels) vs. mature (with lower Ccna1 gene and protein levels) MCCs. In either case, both the qPCR and the Western blot results support a trend indicating that actively ciliating MCCs have high Ccna1 transcript and protein levels, which is downregulated as ciliogenesis concludes â supporting a role for Ccna1 in regulating this process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to quantifying ciliated vs. non-ciliated cells in Ccna1ko mice and including Western blot loading controls, there are two other minor things that need to be clarified: 1. Figure 3: The authors stated that they did not detect a statistically significant difference in the Myb+/Foxj1- population under the Cdki treatment. However, in the Figure 3C, the fraction of Myb+/Foxj1- is significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05) in the Nu6140 acute treated ALI at D4 as compared with untreated ALI at D3.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of the <italic>Ccna1KO</italic> results is now included in the manuscript (new Figure 7âfigure supplement 7A).</p><p>Ponceau-S stained membranes serving as loading control for Western blots are now show in the following: new Figure 4âfigure supplement 4B for Figure 4C and new Figure 5âfigure supplement 5B for Figure 5B.</p><p>We thank the Reviewers for catching this, as it is an error. We have now corrected the figure to indicate that there was no significant change detected in the Myb+/Foxj1- population in the Nu6140 acute treated ALI+4d as compared with untreated ALI+3d (t=0).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Finally, the last four paragraphs of the Discussion could be condensed since it is speculation and not directly focused on the data. I think that one major emphasis of the discussion should be a comparison to Al Jord et al., 2017, who show that Cdk1 (rather than Cdk2) in balance with APC is required for centriole amplification-ciliation and inhibition of mitosis, respectively. The Vlader discussion should further explain why Al Jord implicates Cdk1 and Vlader Cdk2 beyond what is written in paragraph two. The authors should discuss specifically if they believe that their data indicate that Cdk2 is directly a program or has specific protein targets these issues are discussed loosely in paragraphs three, four and five. Consider inhibition of APC and examine Cdk2-dependent centriole amplification, this would address the discussion point in paragraph six.</p></disp-quote><p>The Discussion has been condensed and we now discuss and compare in more detail our study regarding the role of Cdk2 and the Al Jord study on Cdk1. The APC inhibition experiment is interesting but we feel that it is beyond the scope of this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
