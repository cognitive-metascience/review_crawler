When a stem cell divides in two, it typically produces another stem cell and a cell that goes on to differentiate. Hematopoietic stem cells (or HSCs) are found in the bone marrow and give rise to all blood cells throughout the life of an organism. It is therefore crucial that they divide correctly to maintain the balance between renewing their numbers and making new types of cells.</p><p>Many studies have investigated how stem cells are maintained, but there are still major gaps in our knowledge. Recent research suggested that the cell’s “ubiquitin-proteasome system” might be important for regulating stem cell division. This system rapidly degrades proteins, thereby regulating protein abundance in cells. Enzymes known as E3 ligases form part of this system, and recognize proteins to be marked for destruction with a small protein tag.</p><p>Gao et al. have now observed that a component of an E3 ligase called DDB1 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells. Further experiments revealed that genetically engineered mice that lack DDB1 in their population of blood cells die soon after they are born and have fewer blood cells. Gao et al. next inhibited the production of DDB1 in adult mice. This stopped the adult mice’s hematopoietic stem cells from dividing, and the mice died because their bone marrow couldn’t produce new blood cells. These results show that DDB1 is necessary for stem cells to renew their numbers and differentiate into blood cells in both developing and adult animals.</p><p>Next, Gao et al. investigated the how DDB1 regulates stem cell division, and discovered that a protein called p53, which is a key player in controlling cell division, is regulated by DDB1. Under normal conditions, p53 levels are kept low in cells. However, in the absence of DDB1, the levels of p53 rise, which triggers the death of the hematopoietic stem cells.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that not all dividing cells undergo cell death with the loss of DDB1. Instead, Gao et al. found that rapidly dividing embryonic stem cells differentiate when DDB1 is lost but do not die. These findings suggest that specific components of the ubiquitin ligase complex play a key role in deciding a stem cell’s fate. In the future, identifying these components will further our understanding of the decision of stem cells to differentiate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07539.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07539.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin proteasome system</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aifantis</surname><given-names>Iannis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DDB1, a component of the ubiquitin proteasome system, plays a role in both hematopoietic and embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.</meta-value> </custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells posses the unique properties of self-renewal and the capacity to differentiate to multiple cell types. In the case of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) they are rare and specialized cells, which are able to give rise to all blood lineages. The balance between HSC self-renewal and differentiation needs to be tightly regulated in order to keep the HSC pool size as well as to constantly replenish mature blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orkin and Zon, 2008</xref>). HSC function is governed extrinsically by cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zsebo et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Sauvage et al., 1996</xref>) and developmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>) and intrinsically by transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tothova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reavie et al., 2010</xref>), cell cycle regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2000</xref>) and metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakada et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, little is known about how HSCs are regulated at the post-translational level. The ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation system (UPS) is a primary mechanism that controls protein turnover and activation. UPS acts via three sequential enzymes: an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and an E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crusio et al., 2010</xref>). Among these three enzymes, E3 ubiquitin ligases confer substrate specificity. An E3 ubiquitin ligase is a multi-subunit complex that recognizes and binds specific target proteins via substrate recognizing subunits. In HSCs, it has been shown that <italic>Fbw7</italic>, an E3 ubiquitin ligase member, governs quiescence of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsuoka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Itch</italic> and <italic>c-Cbl</italic>, other two E3 ubiquitin ligases, have been reported to negatively regulate HSC homeostasis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rathinam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rathinam et al., 2011</xref>). In other stem cell systems, it has been shown that <italic>Huwe1</italic>, a HECT domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulates proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells as well as embryonic stem cells (ESC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Arca et al., 2010</xref>). Protein levels of OCT4 and NANOG, transcription factors required for pluripotency, are modulated in an ubiquitin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramakrishna et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting key roles of E3 ligase complexes for ESC differentiation. Recently we mapped the ubiquitinated protein landscape in mouse ESC and identified critical UPS members regulating ESC pluripotency and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>DNA damage binding protein 1 (<italic>Ddb1</italic>), a component of the Cullin4-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, was originally identified as a protein involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway. DDB1 heterodimerizes with DDB2 and shows high affinity for UV-induced DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batty et al., 2000</xref>). Once bound to a damaged site, the CUL4-DDB1 complex ubiquitinates DDB2 and targets it for degradation, facilitating subsequent repair events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugasawa et al., 2005</xref>). The CUL4-DDB1ligase is a multi-component complex. Through its C-terminus, CUL4A or CUL4B binds to the RING finger protein to interact with the E2 conjugating enzyme. On its N-terminus, CUL4A or CUL4B binds to DDB1 to recruit CUL4-DDB1 associated factors (DCAF), a family of WD40 repeat proteins which confer substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higa et al., 2006</xref>). The CUL4-DDB1 ligase has been shown to target several substrates for ubiquitin dependent degradation. The list of substrates include the DNA replication licensing factor Cdt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2004</xref>), the cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bondar et al., 2006</xref>) and Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishitani et al., 2008</xref>), the histone methyltransferase PR-Set7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tardat et al., 2010</xref>), and Epe1, a JmjC domain-containing histone demethylase in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2011</xref>). More recently it has been found that the CUL4-DDB1 complex can be modulated by binding of the drug, lenalidomide leading to degradation of lymphoid transcription factors IKZF1 and IKF3 in multiple myeloma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kronke et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that the CUL4-DDB1 ligase complex has numerous substrates that it affects a variety of cellular functions, and that the complex can be altered with targeted therapeutics. Intriguingly, germline <italic>Cul4a</italic> deleted mice are viable and display no gross abnormality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2009</xref>), possibly due to redundancy with <italic>Cul4b</italic>, whereas <italic>Ddb1</italic> deletion is embryonic lethal and embryos are not seen past E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cang et al., 2006</xref>). Conditional inactivation of <italic>Cul4a</italic> in the skin leads to resistance to UV-induced skin carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Specific deletion of <italic>Ddb1</italic> in brain results in elimination of neuronal progenitor cells, hemorrhages in brain, and neonatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cang et al., 2006</xref>). DDB1 also plays a role in ESC self-renewal, and silencing of <italic>Ddb1</italic> led ESC to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the role of the DDB1 in hematopoietic stem cells, we inactivated the <italic>Ddb1</italic> gene in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and at different developmental stages. Here we report that <italic>Ddb1</italic> loss impairs HSPC function in both the adult bone marrow and the fetal liver. More specifically, <italic>Ddb1</italic> deletion leads to induction of DNA damage, rapid induction of apoptosis, and Trp53 response, resulting in bone marrow failure and acute lethality. However, deletion of <italic>Ddb1</italic> had no effect on resting mature lymphoid cells and whereas in proliferating embryonic stem cells (ESC) silencing of <italic>Ddb1</italic> led to loss of pluripotency without effects on cell survival. Our results demonstrate CUL4-DDB1 is a novel regulator of stem cell homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fetal hematopoiesis is absolutely dependent on <italic>Ddb1</italic> function</title><p>To study the role of distinct ubiquitin ligases in the biology of HSCs, we initially performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide expression in lineage<sup>-</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup> (LSK) cells, a population enriched for HSCs, and found several E3 ligases among the top 20% highly expressed genes, including the already reported HSC regulators <italic>Fbw7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Cul1, Itch</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rathinam et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>c-Cbl</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rathinam et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

The Vav1 promoter drives the expression of Cre recombinase in entire hematopoietic compartment during embryonic development (~E13.5) from HSC and progenitors to mature cells. Efficient deletion of Ddb1 in bone marrow was confirmed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). <italic>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Vav1Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice were born at normal frequencies and were indistinguishable from littermates. However, <italic>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Vav1Cre</italic><sup>+</sup> animals died rapidly after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Peripheral blood analysis at day 7 showed that <italic>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Vav1Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice had significantly decreased counts of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets compared to littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). Moreover, the cellularity and size of thymus and spleen were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref>). When analyzed by flow cytometry, lineage<sup>-</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup> (LSK) cells, a population enriched for HSCs, and cKit<sup>+</sup> progenitors were undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). Mature lymphoid (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> in thymus, B220<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup> in spleen) and myeloid (Gr1<sup>+</sup>Mac1<sup>+</sup> in spleen) cells were severely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). Since Vav1Cre expression starts as early as embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stadtfeld and Graf, 2005</xref>), we hypothesized that the pan-cytopenia in <italic>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Vav1Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> neonates was due to defects initiated during fetal hematopoiesis. Analysis of E16.5 fetal liver of <italic>Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::Vav1Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice showed that the deletion of <italic>Ddb1</italic> in fetal hematopoietic cells led to reduction of the LSK and cKit<sup>+</sup> progenitors, as well as mature CD19<sup>+</sup> B-lymphoid and Gr1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). Interestingly, the distribution of LT-HSC and MPP was skewed with higher frequency of LT-HSC and lower frequency of MPP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). Genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed that <italic>Ddb1</italic>-deficient LSKs up-regulated genes associated with stem cell identity (<italic>Mecom, Thy1, Angpt1</italic>) and down-regulated genes associated with differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j,k</xref>), consistent with the phenotypic enrichment of the HSC population.

In this mouse model, Cre recombinase expression initiates at the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>T-lymphocyte stage of development, a population characterized by minimal cell proliferation. DDB1 was efficiently deleted at protein and mRNA levels in total thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b</xref>). The residual <italic>Ddb1</italic> expression in total thymocytes could be attributed to the existence of DN cells in which the Cre recombinase was not expressed. We then examined T cell profiles in thymi and peripheral lymphoid tissue of <italic>Ddb1<sup>F/F</sup>::Cd4Cre</italic><sup>+</sup> mice. We found that these mice had normal thymocyte numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), and normal CD4/CD8 cell profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), confirming our hypothesis that <italic>Ddb1</italic> deletion in mature/resting T cells did not affect T cell development. To test this hypothesis further, we stimulated peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> cells using anti-CD3/CD28 treatment in vitro. When activated, the control T cells entered cell cycle, incorporated BrdU, an analogue of thymidine which is incorporated during DNA synthesis, and underwent several rounds of cell division as shown by the dilution of CFSE labeling. Strikingly, the DDB1 deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> cells failed to proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Instead, more AnnexinV positive cells were found in the culture of DDB1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>), suggesting induction of cell death. Furthermore, we labeled anti-CD3/CD28 treated cells with EdU, an alternative of BrdU and easier for detection by immunoflourescence, and found that there were once more significantly fewer cells incorporating EdU when <italic>Ddb1</italic> was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g,h</xref>), suggesting <italic>Ddb1</italic> deletion interferes with cell cycle progression. Combination of BrdU and DAPI labeling clearly showed that, when stimulated to proliferate, DDB1 deficient resting cells were unable to enter S phase of the cell cycle. Consistent with this result, the Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> protein, a potent CDK and cell cycle inhibitor, was accumulated in DDB1-deficient cells at the protein level, but not mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i,j</xref>). When proteasome-dependent protein degradation was inhibited by MG132, Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> was significantly accumulated in control cells, however less protein accumulation following proteasome inhibition was seen in DDB1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>), demonstrating that Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> degradation is dependent on DDB1 function. To prove direct interaction, Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> was co-immunoprecipitated with Cul4 and DDB1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), suggesting that Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> is indeed a substrate of Cul4a<sup>DDB1</sup>.

We identified interacting proteins in three distinct cell types. The different cell types expressed DDB1 protein at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). First, DDB1-interacting proteins were identified in ESC by targeting DDB1 in tandem with StrepII/Flag tags in the Col1A locus and generating a doxycycline-inducible ESC cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b,d</xref>). We also transiently expressed DDB1 in tandem with HA/Flag tags in 293T cells, and stably transduced DDB1 in tandem with Strep/Flag tags in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line capable of hematopoietic differentiation (HL60) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>). Interacting proteins were identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We identified 140 proteins in ESC, 110 proteins in 293T, and 128 in HL60 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Interestingly very little overlap was found between subsets except CUL4A and proteins that make up the 26S proteasome. Another subset of proteins identified in ESC and 293T analyses were known proteins found in CUL4<sup>DDB1</sup> complexes (CUL4B, CUL4B, VprBP, DDA1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a,b</xref>). Interaction of VprBP and DDB1 was validated in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10d</xref>). One subset of proteins that was of importance was the DCAF proteins since they are the substrate recognizing proteins in the CUL4<sup>DDB1</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee and Zhou, 2007</xref>). In ESC we identified DCAF11, DCAF15, DCAF4, DCAF8, whereas in the hematopoietic cell line HL60 only DCAF7 was identified suggesting that differing complexes between cell types maybe responsible for the loss of DDB1 phenotype in different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,c</xref>). To determine the DCAF proteins that responsible for the ESC DDB1-loss phenotype, we performed an RNAi screen targeting 15 known protein-members of the Cul4<sup>DDB1</sup> complex in ESC. Utilizing a reporter Nanog-GFP cell line as a marker of pluripotency we identified that of the DDB1-interacting DCAF proteins found in ESC silencing of DBA1, VprBP, and DCAF11 led to ESC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10e</xref>). Furthermore, depletion of DDA1, VprBP, and DCAF11 led to down-regulation of transcripts associated with ESC pluripotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10g</xref>) and lead to morphology changes consistent with differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10f</xref>). To determine if silencing of these DCAFs (DDA1, VprBP or DCAF11) in HSPC is also able to affect differentiation and/or maintenance, we transduced bone marrow-purified HSPC (LSK) cells with retroviruses expressing shRNAs against the selected DCAF genes. Interestingly, DDA1 silencing had no effect on colony formation in methylcellulose cultures, whereas a mild reduction in colonies was seen when VprBP was silenced. On the other hand, silencing of DCAF11 lead to a significant (greater than 50%) reduction in colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10h</xref>). shRNA silencing was confirmed to be greater than 60% with all shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10i</xref>). These findings are consistent with the levels of DCAF11 expression in both LSK and Lineage<sup>neg</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> HSPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10j</xref>). These findings suggest that different phenotypes in ESC, HSPC, and T-lymphocytes could be attributed to distinct substrate recognition by DDB1-associated DCAFs.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07539.011</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Tagged expression of DDB1 in ESC.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Western blot of DDB1 in different cell types.

Conditional ablation of <italic>Ddb1</italic> in adult and fetal HSPCs, using the Mx1Cre and Vav1Cre strains respectively, led to a complete loss of progenitors and stem cells, cytopenia, and acute lethality. Furthermore, increased levels of apoptosis and DNA damages were associated with acute <italic>Ddb1</italic> inactivation in HSPCs, suggesting that <italic>Ddb1</italic> regulates a wide range of cellular functions essential for the maintenance of hematopoiesis. Strikingly, inactivation of <italic>Ddb1</italic> in resting lymphocytes (using the CD4Cre strain) had no significant effects. Whereas, silencing DDB1 in embryonic stem cells leads to loss of pluripotency and self-renewal devoid of alterations in cell cycle or cell survival. These observations demonstrate that Ddb1 is essential for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in both HSPC and ESC. Previous studies demonstrate that the mechanism of CUL4-DDB1 differs depending on the cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bondar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tardat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kronke et al., 2014</xref>). Our studies suggest that Ddb1 deletion affects hematopoietic progenitors by triggering DNA damage and Trp53 response, leading to the rapid induction of apoptosis. Knockdown of DDB1 in ESC by shRNA is not as efficient as Cre- mediated genetic deletion. However, the DDB1 knockdown clearly is sufficient to affect ES cell pluripotency and lead to differentiation (with no effects on apoptosis). At the same time, when DDB1 was silenced (by the same shRNAs) in 293T cells these cells underwent rapid apoptosis, even if the knockdown was not 100% (data not shown). Similarly, silencing of DDB1 in Lineage<sup>neg</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> progenitors also lead to cell death and absence of colony formation in CFU assays (data not shown). Additionally, deleting DDB1 in the early embryo is lethal, however the embryos survive till around E12.5 far past the point of the proliferation of the inner cell mass, suggesting proliferation and differentiation during early embryogenesis could be DDB1-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p><italic>Ddb1</italic> shows an intriguing pattern of expression during hematopoiesis. It is one of the highest expressed genes in the multipotent progenitor (MPP) fraction, and is induced as the quiescent HSCs differentiate. It is expressed in all progenitor populations with the highest levels in progenitors of T cells. Several substrates of CUL4-DDB1 complex have been reported. Interestingly, it appears that there is tissue specificity for the various CUL4-DDB1 substrates. CDT1 and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> appear to be targeted by the complex in both brain and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bondar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cang et al., 2006</xref>). c-JUN and Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> are degraded by the CUL4-DDB1 complex in skin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cang et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, PR-set7, a methyltransferase regulating replication origins, was found to be also a substrate for the CUL4-DDB1 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tardat et al., 2010</xref>). Ddb1 deletion resulted in accumulation of the Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup>, a CDK and cell cycle inhibitor, protein in bone marrow progenitor populations and T lymphocytes. On the other hand, we failed to demonstrate p27<sup>kip1</sup> stabilization in Ddb1-deleted hematopoietic cells (data not shown). Moreover, there was no detectable interaction between p27<sup>kip1</sup> and the CUL4-DDB1 complex. In addition, we failed to detect in <italic>Ddb1</italic>-deleted progenitor cells accumulation of CDT1, a licensing factor of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2004</xref>), or PR-set7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tardat et al., 2010</xref>). However, co-silencing <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> with <italic>Ddb1</italic> did not rescue HSPC homeostasis, which suggests it is unlikely that DDB1 exerts its function solely by regulating Cdkn1a<sup>cip1</sup> turnover in HSPC. Indeed DNA damage and acute induction of cell death were observed upon <italic>Ddb1</italic> deletion. Trp53 pathway silencing partially restored HSPC cell number in <italic>Ddb1</italic>-deleted animals. It is likely that DDB1 controls a broader spectrum of cellular functions, through its interaction with additional novel protein substrates and the proteasome itself (data not shown). However, it should be noted that mice with mixed background were used for Trp53 and Cdkn1a rescue experiments. The phenotype could be strain-dependent due to variation in MHC alleles. More conclusive results would require crossing mice into pure background.</p><p>There are findings suggesting that DDB1 can exert its function independent of CUL4A/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lv et al., 2010</xref>). However, DDB1 mainly functions as an adapter protein for the CUL4-DDB1 complex. The specificity of the complex comes from the DCAF family of proteins that recognize specific substrates. Expression of DCAF proteins is cell-type specific and as we have shown pluripotent and adult stem cell populations vary in expression. Mass spectrometry analysis of DDB1 interacting proteins in ESC, 293T, and HL60 cell lines demonstrate differential binding to specific DCAF proteins suggesting different substrates in these different cellular contents that may correlate with the different phenotypes. Some of the previous identified substrates have been associated with cell cycle control and DNA damage, however Kronke et al. demonstrates that two lymphoid transcription factors (IKZF1 and IKZF3) are also targeted for degradation by CUL4-DDB1 complexes utilizing CRBN, a member of the DCAF family, as the substrate recognizing protein of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kronke et al., 2014</xref>). Although in our mass spectrometry analysis we did not identify CRBN as an interacting partner, we found in hematopoietic (primitive myeloid) cells that DCAF7 interacted with the CUL4-DDB1 complex whereas Vprbp and DCAF11 were found to interact with DDB1 and silencing in ESC mimicked the loss of DDB1 phenotype. Interestingly, in multiple myeloma cells treatment with lenalidomide increased ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3, demonstrating that small molecules can modulate the CUL4-DDB1-DCAF complex.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Ddb1<sup>f/</sup></italic><sup>f</sup> mice and their genotyping were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Long et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Ddb1f/f::Mx1Cre</italic><sup>+</sup> animals were on C57BL/6 background, and were injected with 10 μg polyI:C per gram of body weight every two days for total two or three injections and analyzed 3 days from last injection depending on the experiments.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor), and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following reviewers have agreed to reveal their identity: Hui Zhang and Avinash Bhandoola.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript investigates the role of DDB1, a component of the CUL4 ubiquitin ligase complex, in hematopoietic precursor cells, T cells and ES cells. The authors provide evidence supporting cell context dependent functions and binding partners of DDB1 and discrete roles for this protein in the maintenance of hematopoiesis and hematopoietic progenitor cells, as well as the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. Reviewers agreed that the work on fetal and adult hematopoiesis is comprehensive and of high quality, although one reviewer found the T cell and ES cell work to be a bit more superficial, with conclusions drawn in the first part of the study that were in some cases inconsistent with those in the latter half. It would be useful if the authors worked towards a more unified analysis and discussion, and included specific mention of hematopoietic stem cells in the title (as this would give a more accurate representation of the majority of the data in the paper). In addition, reviewers raised several issues related to the interpretation of experimental data that should be addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors suggest that DDB1 may employ different DCAF proteins in different cells to control various cellular pathways. The concern with this interpretation is that the cell-based effects of DDB1 deletion on different cells may not only depend on its binding to different DCAF proteins. The exact cellular content in different cells may also play a role in defining the final outcome after DDB1 deletion.</p><p>2) Related to this, although Cul4A is prominent in the title and Abstract, its particular role is not really addressed experimentally, and it is possible that some of the described activities of DDB1 may be Cul4A (and even Cul4) independent. Also, as DDB1 binds to both CUL4A and CUL4B to function as an adaptor, it is unclear why the authors claim always that DDB1 functions through CUL4A, unless they have evidence that CUL4B does not play a role. Please consider reducing emphasis on Cul4A in the revised manuscript, changing terminology to include Cul4 or Cul4A/4B, and entertaining possible alternative models for DDB1 function in the Discussion.</p><p>3) Please provide the interacting proteins of <italic>Ddb1</italic> in different cell types as a supplement.</p><p>4) In multiple places, the authors interpret the rapid loss of mature blood cells from the DDB1-deficient hematopoietic compartment as indicating that DDB1 specifically targets proliferating progenitors; however, it is likely given the rapidity of cell loss that <italic>Ddb1</italic> deficiency also and independently impacts downstream cells. This notion is supported by the authors' observations of the effects of DDB1 loss in proliferating T cells. The authors should therefore temper their comments to be more in line with their data.</p><p>5) Please address the concern that <italic>Ddb1</italic> reduction in the ES model appears much less robust than in the Cre-models used for analysis of hematopoiesis, making it difficult to determine whether the different phenotypic consequences in these models truly reflect differences in cellular context or gene dosage effects.</p><p>6) Similarly in the proteomic analyses, are the levels of DDB1 expression in the various cell types equivalent? Or is it possible that the reported differences in binding partners reflect differences in ddrb1 protein levels rather than differences in cellular context?</p><p>7) Finally, the notion that DDB1 is impacting fundamentally distinct cellular processes in HSPCs and ESCs is interesting; however, the authors' conclusion that this occurs through differential substrate recognition (subheading “DDB1 interacts with different DCAF proteins in specific cell types”) is somewhat problematic in that it is based on an interactome analysis performed in 293, HL60 and ESC. If cellular context is a key determinant of substrate interactions, then it may be misleading to extrapolate interactions in 293 and HL60 to T lymphocytes and HSPCs. It would be nice to see, at least, in vitro studies in HSPCs of the factors the authors implicated in ESCs (DDA1, VprBP, and DCAF11), some of which are also expressed in HSCs (i.e., VprBP and DCAF11). This would more specifically support the argument that the networks are molecularly different and thus underlie the functional differences in loss of <italic>Ddb1</italic>.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a:</xref> b-actin should be beta-actin.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: no DDB1 deletion Western blots were presented in f/f, VavCre<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>: total p53 should be included.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: although abnormal cell cycle in DDB1 deficient cells were not observed, were p53 and phosphor-p53 and p21 induced?</p><p>5) Subheading “DDB1 interacts with distinct DCAF proteins in a cell type specific manner”, CUL4B is not a component of the CUL4A-DDB1 complex, it is an independent CUL4B-DDB1 complex.

It would be useful to address this possibility, experimentally or in the text.</p><p>9) Gate shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> appears to indicate Lin+ cells, but the subsequent analysis is for Lin-. It would make more sense to show the Lin- gate.</p><p>10) I'm unsure what the authors mean by &quot;accumulation was stunted in DDB1-deficient cells&quot; (subheading “DDB1 is dispensable for mature T cells”). What is &quot;stunted&quot; in this context? It looks to me like the p21 levels are higher in cells prior to treatment, but the levels still go up with MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>).</p><p>11) The frequencies of CD150+CD48- LT-HSCs appear to vary dramatically in the ddb1-deficient mice in different experiments (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref> (20-30%), with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref> (6%) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref> (8%); yet the error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref> are quite small. Does this reflect different time points of analysis?</p><p>12) What accounts for the survival of a subset (60%) of p53 null ddb1-deficient mice? (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>).

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor) and a Reviewing editor. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Regarding Essential Revision point #5, this caveat should also be included in the manuscript as a discussion point.</p><p>2) Regarding Essential Revision point #6, the authors appear to have misunderstood the concern. They appear to have provided analysis of <italic>Ddb1</italic> expression in untransfected cells, but the basal levels of <italic>Ddb1</italic> are not the issue. <italic>Ddb1</italic> levels must be shown also for the cells that were transfected with tagged-<italic>Ddb1</italic> and used for the mass spectrometry analysis, as differences in <italic>Ddb1</italic> in this setting could contribute to different results in the mass spectrum. Please add these data.</p><p>3) Regarding Essential Revision point #7, the new data on knockdown of dda1, dcaf11 and vprbp in HSPCs is very useful, but again, they need to include the relevant controls showing the degree of knockdown achieved for each of these targets in HSPCs and in ESCs to discriminate gene dosage from cell context effects.</p><p>4) Regarding the response to Minor point #11, the analysis of mice on a mixed background presents an issue for interpretation of the HSPC frequency and transplantation data. How do the authors control for this in their breeding and analysis scheme? The mixed background of the animals must be clearly noted in the Materials and methods and relevant figure legends, and any differences in background in the control versus experimental animals must be noted.</p><p>5) In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, I do not see the upregulation of p21 in RA-differentiated ESC samples that the authors describe in the text.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex controls adult and embryonic stem cell differentiation and homeostasis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor) and the Reviewing editor. The manuscript has been improved but there is one critical issue that we're concerned about and that needs to be addressed for the paper to be accepted:</p><p>In addressing the issue of &quot;mixed backgrounds&quot; in their response, the authors indicate that mice were bred as heterozygotes for the targeted alleles to generate control and experimental animals for the Trp53<italic><sup>-/-</sup></italic>::Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::MxCre<sup>+</sup> and Cdkn1a<sup>cip-/-</sup>::Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::MxCre<sup>+</sup> experiments, and littermates of these F2 animals were used in all the experiments. As different inheritance of histocompatibility or other alleles could confound experimental outcomes with such a breeding scheme, it is very important to be explicit about the background of the breeders and progeny, and to state clearly how many times each experiment was performed and with how many independent donor mice. In this breeding scheme, even littermates can differ with respect to histocompatibility alleles, so it is critical to have a clear explanation from the authors for why the experiments were not confounded by such a difference. For example, comment on whether there might be any linkage between the targeted alleles and histocompatibility alleles, and whether MHC alleles differ among the backgrounds of the mice used in the breeding. This information should be added to the Materials and methods section, and the note in the legend &quot;mice were mixed background&quot; should explicitly state the backgrounds represented in the experimental mice, and the number of independent experiments performed for each assay.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07539.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors suggest that DDB1 may employ different DCAF proteins in different cells to control various cellular pathways.

We have made the suggested change: We have changed it to CUL4-DDB1 throughout the paper, and discussed the possibility of CUL4- independent function of DDB1 (paragraph three, Discussion). Consistent with this notion, Cul4a<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Cul4a<sup>f/f</sup>EIIaCre) were viable and displayed no overt developmental abnormalities throughout their life span (Liu et al., Mol Cell 2009), including no overt hematopoietic phenotypes (our private communication).</p><p><italic>3) Please provide the interacting proteins of Ddb1 in different cell types as a supplement.</italic> </p><p>We have added <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> with the interacting proteins to our revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) In multiple places, the authors interpret the rapid loss of mature blood cells from the DDB1-deficient hematopoietic compartment as indicating that DDB1 specifically targets proliferating progenitors; however, it is likely given the rapidity of cell loss that ddb1 deficiency also and independently impacts downstream cells.

It is true that knockdown DDB1 in ESC by shRNA is not as efficient as Cre-mediated genetic deletion. The difference is unfortunately limited by the methodology itself. However, the DDB1 knock-down clearly is sufficient to affect ES cell pluripotency and lead to differentiation (with no effects on apoptosis). At the same time, when DB1 was silenced (by the same shRNAs) in 293T cells these cells underwent rapid apoptosis, even if the knock-down was not 100% (data not shown). Similarly, silencing of DDB1 in Lineage<sup>neg</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> progenitors also lead to cell death and absence of colony formation in CFU assays (data not shown).</p><p>Additionally, it was previously published by Cang et al. that DDB1 knockout mice are embryonic lethal at around E12.5 far past the point of the proliferation of the inner cell mass, suggesting that loss of DDB1 does not lead to apoptosis in the population of cells where ESC are derived (Cang et al. Cell 2006).</p><p><italic>6) Similarly in the proteomic analyses, are the levels of DDB1 expression in the various cell types equivalent? Or is it possible that the reported differences in binding partners reflect differences in ddrb1 protein levels rather than differences in cellular context?</italic> </p><p>This is a very good point that we have now addressed experimentally.</p><p><italic>Ddb1</italic> transcript and protein levels were high – and approximately equivalent – in all cell types used for mass spectrometry. Western blot analysis of the cell types has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Although we cannot exclude slight differences that stem from expression levels, we do not think that protein levels of expression are explaining the differences in interactions between DDB1 and associated proteins.</p><p><italic>7) Finally, the notion that DDB1 is impacting fundamentally distinct cellular processes in HSPCs and ESCs is interesting; however, the authors' conclusion that this occurs through differential substrate recognition (subheading “DDB1 interacts with different DCAF proteins in specific cell types”) is somewhat problematic in that it is based on an interactome analysis performed in 293, HL60 and ESC. If cellular context is a key determinant of substrate interactions, then it may be misleading to extrapolate interactions in 293 and HL60 to T lymphocytes and HSPCs. It would be nice to see, at least, in vitro studies in HSPCs of the factors the authors implicated in ESCs (DDA1, VprBP, and DCAF11), some of which are also expressed in HSCs (i.e., VprBP and DCAF11). This would more specifically support the argument that the networks are molecularly different and thus underlie the functional differences in loss of Ddb1.</italic> </p><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for suggesting this interesting experiment. DDA1, Vprbp, and DCAF11 are all expressed at the transcript level in LSK progenitors, however due to obvious limitations in mass spectrometry we are unable to look at DDB1 interacting proteins in LSK (we usually get 50,000 LSK from each mouse). To address this question in HSPCs (LSK), we silenced Dda1, Vprbp, and Dcaf11 using RNAi (shRNAs) in colony forming (CFU) assays. I wanted to remind you here that deletion or silencing of DDB1 leads to a profound loss of colony forming ability of stem and progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, silencing of the specific DCAF genes (that showed strong phenotypes in ES cell differentiation, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) in LSK led to varying and relatively mild effects on colony unit formation. For example, Ddda1 silencing had no effects on LSK differentiation, however, it was one of the strongest modulators of ES cell differentiation. Similarly, the effects of Vprbp silencing were negligible in LSKs but very significant in ES cells. We actually have studied hematopoiesis in Vprbp animals and found that its deletion does not significantly affects overall HSC differentiation (our unpublished data) supporting our CFU analysis demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10h</xref>. On the other hand, Dcaf11 silencing appears to affect both LSK and ES cell differentiation. These results are now presented in subheading “DDB1 interacts with distinct DCAF proteins in a cell type specific manner” and can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>.</p><p><italic>Minor points:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>: b-actin should be beta-actin.</italic> </p><p>This change has been made.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, no DDB1 deletion Western blots were presented in f/f, VavCre+ cells.</italic></p><p>We have added qRT-PCR in f/f VavCre<sup>+</sup> cells to demonstrate loss of Ddb1 in this mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, total p53 should be included.</italic> </p><p>We have added total p53 western blot to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, although abnormal cell cycle in DDB1 deficient cells were not observed, were p53 and phosphor-p53 and p21 induced?</italic> </p><p>We have now performed these experiments.

We hope this addresses the reviewers concerns.</p><p><italic>2) Regarding Essential Revision point #6, the authors appear to have misunderstood the concern. They appear to have provided analysis of Ddb1 expression in untransfected cells, but the basal levels of Ddb1 are not the issue. Ddb1 levels must be shown also for the cells that were transfected with tagged-Ddb1 and used for the mass spectrometry analysis, as differences in Ddb1 in this setting could contribute to different results in the mass spectrum. Please add these data.</italic> </p><p>We apologize, we indeed misunderstood the reviewer’s concern. At the time prior to mass spectrometry we analyzed our samples for exogenous expression of DDB1. We now include protein expression data for HL-60 transduced cells and ESC induced to express DDB1 in updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. As you see, in ES cells we achieve very mild – almost at wild-type levels – expression of exogenous DDB1. Despite this low expression, ESC-expressed DDB1 was found to interact with a significant number of DCAF proteins, even more that the DCAF proteins identified in HL60 cells where exogenous expression was higher. So we believe that it is unlikely that we simply had more DCAFs because we express DDB1 at higher levels. Moreover, the overall number of DDB1-interacting proteins identified by mass spec was very similar in all three populations (ESC=140, 293T=110, and HL-60=128).</p><p><italic>3) Regarding Essential Revision point #7, the new data on knockdown of dda1, dcaf11 and vprbp in HSPCs is very useful, but again, they need to include the relevant controls showing the degree of knockdown achieved for each of these targets in HSPCs and in ESCs to discriminate gene dosage from cell context effects.</italic> </p><p>We apologize that this data was not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. At the time of plating cells for CFU assay a proportion of the cells were used for qRT-PCR to determine% of knockdown in LSK. We have added the qRT-PCR results in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10i</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Regarding the response to Minor point #11, the analysis of mice on a mixed background presents an issue for interpretation of the HSPC frequency and transplantation data. How do the authors control for this in their breeding and analysis scheme? The mixed background of the animals must be clearly noted in the Methods and relevant figure legends, and any differences in background in the control versus experimental animals must be noted.</italic> </p><p>In all experiments presented in this manuscript we always utilize littermates as controls in order to safely interpret for analysis. Mice are always bred heterozygous for the targeted alleles to generate mice for both controls and experimental group. We have added this information in both the figures and the Methods.</p><p><italic>5) In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, I do not see the upregulation of p21 in RA-differentiated ESC samples that the authors describe in the text.</italic> </p><p>The editor is correct. We have removed this specific comment concerning p21 protein expression in differentiated ESC.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p> <italic>In addressing the issue of &quot;mixed backgrounds&quot; in their response, the authors indicate that mice were bred as heterozygotes for the targeted alleles to generate control and experimental animals for the Trp53<sup>-/-</sup>::Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::MxCre<sup>+</sup> and Cdkn1acip<sup>-/-</sup>::Ddb1<sup>f/f</sup>::MxCre<sup>+</sup> experiments, and littermates of these F2 animals were used in all the experiments. As different inheritance of histocompatibility or other alleles could confound experimental outcomes with such a breeding scheme, it is very important to be explicit about the background of the breeders and progeny, and to state clearly how many times each experiment was performed and with how many independent donor mice. In this breeding scheme, even littermates can differ with respect to histocompatibility alleles, so it is critical to have a clear explanation from the authors for why the experiments were not confounded by such a difference. For example, comment on whether there might be any linkage between the targeted alleles and histocompatibility alleles, and whether MHC alleles differ among the backgrounds of the mice used in the breeding. This information should be added to the Methods section, and the note in the legend &quot;mice were mixed background&quot; should explicitly state the backgrounds represented in the experimental mice, and the number of independent experiments performed for each assay.</italic></p><p>The only remaining issue at this point is the “mixed backgrounds” of the animal used for our Trp53 x Ddb1 and Cdkn1 x Dbb1 crosses and experiments. Initially, let me state that I absolutely agree with you and we now provide additional information regarding repetition of the experiment (Figure legend 5G-I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), breeding schemes (Materials and methods) and number of animals as you have requested (Figure legend 5G-I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Let me add a few more words to clarify our experiments:</p><p>a) Maybe the way that we described the experiments was not optimal, but none of these experiments are transplantations, they are crossed mice in which we delete Ddb1 using pI- pC administration. So we don't expect any effects coming from MHC mismatch of donor versus host.</p><p>b) For the Cdkn1 x Dbb1 cross, we have actually seen no phenotypic rescue and make absolutely no claims or rescue in the text.</p><p>c) For the Trp53 x Ddb1 cross we have only a partial rescue and we clearly state that again, not over-interpreting any results. We recognize that littermates can also have slightly distinct backgrounds (some “more” 129 and others “more” BL6) and the only thing that we could do is to repeat our experiments several times and include a significant number of animals. This is what we have done and all information is added at our revised manuscript. We have addressed this in paragraph two, Discussion.</p><p>d) There is no evidence of linkage between mouse MHC clusters (Chromosome 17) and the Ddb1 (Chromosome 19) or Trp53 (Chromosome 11) genes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
