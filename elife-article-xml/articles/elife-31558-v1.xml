PRC2 has been shown to interact with thousands of RNA species in vivo, but understanding the physiological function of RNA binding has been hampered by the lack of separation-of-function mutants. Here, we use comprehensive mutagenesis and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to identify critical residues for RNA interaction in PRC2 core complexes from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic>, for which crystal structures are known. Preferential binding of G-quadruplex RNA is conserved, surprisingly using different protein elements. Key RNA-binding residues are spread out along the surface of EZH2, with other subunits including EED also contributing, and missense mutations of some of these residues have been found in cancer patients. The unusual nature of this protein-RNA interaction provides a paradigm for other epigenetic modifiers that bind RNA without canonical RNA-binding motifs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>PRC2</kwd><kwd>RNA binding proteins</kwd><kwd>G-quadruplex RNA</kwd><kwd>HDX-MS</kwd><kwd><italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004319</institution-id><institution>Pfizer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brooun</surname><given-names>Alexei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cech</surname><given-names>Thomas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>research grant I-1790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>research grant R1119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM114576</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM121662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007914</institution-id><institution>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Endowed Scholar Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Cecil H. and Ida M.

PRC2 specifically catalyzes mono-, di- and tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3 K27), which is a hallmark for repressed chromatin and provides a chromatin structure that is repressive to transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czermin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Müller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). The PRC2 core complex contains four subunits: (1) EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) or its closely related homolog EZH1, (2) SUZ12 (suppressor of zeste 12), (3) EED (embryonic e<italic>ct</italic>oderm development) and (4) RBBP4 (retinoblastoma binding protein 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>). The complex can include additional subcomponents such as AEBP2 (adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 2). EZH2 contains the enzymatic SET (Su[var]3–9, enhancer of zeste, trithorax) domain, which catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to H3 K27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rea et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dillon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joshi et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>How human PRC2 is recruited to specific sites and regulated on chromatin in mammals is an important unanswered question.

This promiscuous binding can be explained by PRC2 recognizing short tracts of G’s and G-quadruplexes, small motifs which are ubiquitous in the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>What elements within PRC2 bind RNA has been unclear, especially since none of the core PRC2 subunits has an RNA recognition motif (RRM). An unstructured region (residues 342–368) of mouse EZH2 that has been proposed to bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaneko et al., 2010</xref>) is not phylogenetically conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiao and Liu, 2015</xref>), and more important elements for RNA interaction are now apparent (see below). Separation of the RNA-binding role of PRC2 from its other activities – formation of the catalytically competent complex, recognition of histone tails, methyltransferase activity and interactions with accessory proteins – would greatly help to identify any PRC2 recruitment events that are dependent on RNA binding and to characterize RNA-mediated epigenetic silencing or inhibition of silencing.</p><p>A 21 Å electron microscopy structure of the human PRC2 complex shed light on its molecular architecture and subunit organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciferri et al., 2012</xref>), and recently three high-resolution crystal structures of the minimal catalytic core of PRC2 (EZH2, EED and Suz12-VEFS) were determined.

We therefore characterized the RNA-binding specificity of a crystallized PRC2 complex (<italic>ct</italic>PRC2) from a thermophilic fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiao and Liu, 2015</xref>). We first measured the binding affinity (illustrated by <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub><sup>app</sup>) of purified <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 with a variety of synthetic homopolymeric 40-mer RNAs. <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 had specificity for poly (G) RNA, while having the lowest affinity for poly (A) RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Second, <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 preferred binding to RNA sequences capable of folding into G-quadruplexes ((GGAA)<sub>10</sub>, (G4A4)4 and G<sub>40</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). For example, (GGAA)<sub>10</sub> and (GA)<sub>20</sub> RNA have the same nucleotide composition, but <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 has strong preference for (GGAA)<sub>10</sub>, which is capable of forming G-quadruplexes. Third, the affinity for G-quadruplex-forming RNAs was cation-specific, as illustrated by the fold change of <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub><sup>app</sup> in K<sup>+</sup> buffer versus Li<sup>+</sup> buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). K<sup>+</sup> stimulates G-quadruplex conformation while Li<sup>+</sup> does not, so the fold change larger than one indicates a specific interaction between <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 and the folded G-quadruplex conformation of (GGAA)<sub>10</sub>, (G4A4)4 and G<sub>40</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

RNA-binding studies with the chimeric 3 m <italic>ac</italic>/<italic>hs</italic>PRC2-3 protein complexes previously used for structural work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooun et al., 2016</xref>) showed that the substitution of residues in <italic>ac</italic>EZH2 corresponding to residues 488–510 in <italic>hs</italic>EZH2 to a glycine-serine linker caused a significant reduction in binding to (GGAA)<sub>10</sub> RNA, while deletion of the previously reported RNA-binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaneko et al., 2010</xref>) did not affect binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, an alternative RNA crosslinking approach using a 4-thio-uridine-labeled G-quadruplex RNA supports this region (residues 488–510 adj<italic>ac</italic>ent to Z3) as being critical for interaction, because mutation of this region in <italic>ac</italic>/<italic>hs</italic>PRC2 caused loss of crosslinking of the RNA to PRC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This crosslinking experiment also indicated that the majority of RNA is crosslinked to the EZH2 subunit rather than the other two subunits, supporting our conclusion that EZH2 is the most important subunit for RNA interaction. Thus, we decided to focus NAAIRS scanning mutagenesis at the 489–510 region, which led to the identification of amino acids 489–494 (PRKKKR) as critical for RNA binding in the context of 3 m <italic>hs</italic>PRC2 complex. The 489–494 NAAIRS substitution mutant (PRKKKR to NAAIRS) retained its methyltransferase activity, with a 10-fold reduction in RNA binding. NAAIRS substitutions for other residues in the 489–510 region had only a modest effect on RNA binding and also had negative effect on methyltransferase activity suggesting that even if those binding effects are real they could be the consequence of a large conformation change.</p><p>Z4 (645–665) is located at the I-SET alpha-helix that is critical for maintaining catalytically competent PRC2 in basal state via interaction with SAL and this region interacts with SRM in the activated PRC2 structure resulting in further increase in catalytic activity. We picked two positive-charged amino acids (R653 and K656) in this region and substituted each of them with alanine. (We did not mutate R654 because it is involved in an intramolecular salt bridge and is important for catalysis.) The K656A mutant bound (GGAA)<sub>10</sub> RNA 4–5 fold weaker compared to the wild-type <italic>hs</italic>PRC2 concurrent with 50% increase of methyltransferase activity, while R653A had a modest change in RNA binding and also showed reduced methyltransferase activity, suggesting an important role of K656 in G-quadruplex RNA binding.</p><p>In short, we identified several key residues in human EZH2 that are important for RNA binding: F32, R34, D36 and K39 in the N-terminal helix, residues 489–494 (PRKKKR) in the CXC domain and K656 in the I-SET helix of EZH2. Importantly, H3 methylation activities were tested on all mutants and most had no change in catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), except the K656A mutation resulted in an increase in activity (1.5 fold). Two important separation-of-function mutants were successfully made (the F32A, R34A, D36A and K39A quadruple mutant and the 489–494 NAAIRS substitution mutant). When we combined the key mutations, the RNA binding defect became more severe, with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub><sup>app</sup> to (GGAA)<sub>10</sub> RNA increasing by around 12-fold compared to the wild-type 3 m <italic>hs</italic>PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In addition, when we mutated these residues in the context of the holoenzyme - 5 m <italic>hs</italic>PRC2 (EZH2-SUZ12-EED-RBBP4-AEBP2), the mutant [F32A R34A D36A K39A and PRKKKR489-494NAAIRS] complex had no defects in assembly compared to the wild-type complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but exhibited a significant binding defect to (GGAA)<sub>10</sub> RNA in a fluorescent anisotropy binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>, left panel).

However, many of these proteins do not contain an obvious RNA-binding motif such as an RRM (RNA recognition motif), and this has hindered critical tests of the function of RNA binding. In the few cases, when RNA-binding determinants were studied, RNA binding seemed to occur at multiple sites of the protein. For example, DNA methyltransferase 3 (DNMT3) has been shown to interact with an RNA at its catalytic domain in a structurally dependent way while two other RNAs can interact at an allosteric site outside the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holz-Schietinger and Reich, 2012</xref>). Non-canonical RNA-binding sites might be widespread in such chromatin-binding proteins.</p><p>Here, we undertook a comprehensive study of the non-canonical RNA-binding regions of PRC2. First, we discovered that the RNA-binding specificity of PRC2 is conserved over vast evolutionary distance, from a fungus to human, which provides new evidence for its functional importance. We also identified several key RNA-binding residues of PRC2 from both of these species through a comprehensive analysis using mutagenesis and HDX-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The majority of these residues are located in EZH2, while <italic>hs</italic>EED also contains two regions - 290–308 (E1) and 338–350 (E2) - that are identified in HDX-MS and potentially important for interacting with RNA. The RNA-binding residues are dispersed across the protein surface, which may explain why identifying them by mutagenesis has been so challenging: if any single binding site is affected by mutation, the RNA can still bind to another site(s) and the resultant change in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub><sup>app</sup> is minimal. It will be interesting to see whether other epigenetic modifiers employ this non-canonical mode of RNA binding.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31558.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary of residues on EZH2 of <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 and <italic>hs</italic>PRC2 that are important for binding G-quadruplex RNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crystal structure of a telomeric RNA quadruplex (PDB: 3IBK, sequence: UAGGGUUAGGGU) allows comparison of its size with that of PRC2 structures.

Given the limited sequence homology between <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 and <italic>hs</italic>PRC2, it is striking that the RNA-binding affinity and specificity is evolutionarily conserved over a vast evolutionary distance, inferring that RNA binding of PRC2 could have critical functions in eukaryotes. The best-established function of PRC2-RNA interaction at this point is inhibition of PRC2’s histone methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cifuentes-Rojas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaneko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beltran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>This study also reveals that the 3 m PRC2 complex contains elements sufficient for the RNA-binding specificity. Surprisingly, almost none of the identified key RNA-binding residues are conserved between <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 and <italic>hs</italic>PRC2, and the domains important for RNA interaction are also different. It is possible that <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 and <italic>hs</italic>PRC2 found different paths to achieve the specificity for G-quadruplex RNA, an example of convergent evolution. It is interesting that <italic>ct</italic>EED contains an extra domain that is adjacent to the N-terminal helix of EZH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and this extra domain might prevent RNA interaction with the N-terminal helix (Z1 in <italic>hs</italic>EZH2) due to steric hindrance. Thus <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 could not use the N-terminal helix for RNA interaction as <italic>hs</italic>PRC2 does, and instead needs an alternative site to achieve the RNA-binding specificity.</p><p>Notably, missense mutations of some of the <italic>hs</italic>EZH2 residues critical for RNA binding, including R34, K39 and R494, have been identified in cancer patients (R34L, K39E and R494S mutations, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov</ext-link>). However, it remains unclear what physiological consequences these mutations have in cancer, because each of these heterogeneous mutations was identified in one out of hundreds of patients investigated and in different type of cancers (R34L and K39E were both identified in lung adenocarcinoma patients). Given that RNA binding inhibits PRC2’s ability to act as a histone methyltransferase, these mutant PRC2 proteins might be expected to have increased activity in vivo, a possibility that remains to be investigated. Thus, in addition to EZH2 overexpression, mutation of RNA-binding residues may also drive PRC2 gain-of-function in cancer.</p><p>Previously, residues 342–368 (RBD1) in mouse EZH2 were reported to be important for RNA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaneko et al., 2010</xref>), and this sequence is conserved in <italic>hs</italic>EZH2. Our study was unable to support this finding using three independent experiments: [1] deletion of residues 342–368 in a purified mouse 4 m PRC2 (EZH2-EED-SUZ12-RBBP4) results in no change in binding to a RepA noncoding RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>); [2] deletion of residues 342–368 in a 3 m <italic>hs</italic>PRC2 complex (EZH2-EED-VEFS(SUZ12)) doesn’t affect binding to a (GGAA)<sub>10</sub> G-quadruplex RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, middle left); [3] deletion of the unstructured region in <italic>ac</italic>EZH2, corresponding to region 342–368 of mEZH2 in the context of the hybrid <italic>ac</italic>/<italic>hs</italic>PRC2, does not affect (GGAA)<sub>10</sub> RNA binding or the crosslinking to a 24 nt G-quadruplex RNA. Although it is possible this region is important for interaction with some other RNA that was not tested in this study, this may be unlikely given that different RNAs compete for binding and show similar RNA-protein crosslinking patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2017b</xref>). It also seems possible that this portion of EZH2 might contribute to RNA binding, perhaps indirectly, in some form of PRC2 not studied here.

The critical RNA-binding regions identified in this study when mutated retain substantial histone methyltransferase activity and DNA-binding affinity, and therefore provide a clear path for making separation-of-function mutants to study biological functions of PRC2-RNA interaction in vitro and in vivo. It will be valuable to determine the biological consequences of introducing an RNA-binding defective mutant of PRC2 by investigating changes in global RNA binding pattern, PRC2 chromatin occupancy and genome-wide gene expression, and the findings in this study open the door to study physiological functions of PRC2-RNA interaction including how lncRNAs recruit or evict PRC2 and regulate its activities. Recently, G-quadruplex-forming RNA sequences have been proposed to be largely unfolded in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo and Bartel, 2016</xref>), and it would be interesting to study whether PRC2 can bind and stabilize transiently folded quadruplexes. In addition, the molecular details of how key PRC2 residues cooperate and contribute to RNA interaction is still an open question, and structural analysis including NMR, crystallography and electron microscopy could be used to understand the details of the interaction, which could serve as a guide to study protein-RNA interaction of other chromatin-binding proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification of <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 complexes</title><p>Wild-type 3 m <italic>ct</italic>PRC2 was purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiao and Liu, 2015</xref>).

Deuterium exchange was conducted on a temperature-controlled HDX2 autosampler (Leap Technologies). Aliquots of sample (4 µL) were mixed (1:4) with deuterium exchange buffer (D<sub>2</sub>O 25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl) at 4°C.

A loading pump running 0.1% formic acid at 200 µl/min carried sample sequentially across the pepsin/protease XIII immobilized column (NovaBio Assay) and 2.1 × 5 mm CSH C18 trap column(Waters) for 2 min. Peptides were desalted for an additional 30 s, while the protease column was back-flushed with 0.05% TFA. Peptides were subsequently eluted/separated across a Kinetex C8 2.1 × 50 mm analytical column via a 5.7-min gradient of mobile phase B (8%–37% ACN, 0.1% formic) employing a binary pump gradient with mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B (acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid) at 150 µL/min.</p><p>Data acquisition and processing involved multiple software platforms. Mass spectra were acquired on a Thermo Fusion-Lumos mass spectrometer running XCalibur 2.1 across a scan range of 375–1300 m/z. Orbitrap resolution was set at 60,000 for charge state selection of +2 to + 5 peptides. Peptide fragmentation for peptide identification employed both HCD and EThcd tandem MS2 acquisition. Electrospray source settings were set at high-gas flow (27 sheath, nine aux) and temperature (150°C) to handle the 150 µl/min LC flow rate, while minimizing potential deuterium back-exchange. Peptide pools were generated in Thermo Proteome Discoverer 2.1 with a directed search against the protein sequence, using Sequest HT search and a fixed value PSM validator (0.05 Delta Cn). Tolerances were set at five ppm mass accuracy with 0.6 Da fragment. Deuterium exchange was determined with HDExaminer software.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Conserved RNA Binding Specificity of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Is Achieved by Dispersed Amino Acid Patches in EZH2&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>All of the reviewers and Editors are positive about the study and find it to be a major contribution to the polycomb field. Therefore, we are ready to move forward with the acceptance of the manuscript for publication. Prior to formal acceptance, we wanted to give you the opportunity to textually address the minor comments/suggestions made by expert reviewers. We have included the reviewers comments at the bottom of this letter for you and look forward to receiving the revised version of your study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>PRC2 binds RNA molecules promiscuously, and the authors of this manuscript have recently reported that this occurs with a preference for G-rich sequences and G-quadruplex structures (Wang et al., 2017).</p><p>Here, they show that RNA binding preference is the same for evolutionarily distant ctPRC2 as for human PRC2, and they characterize the binding interface on PRC2 for both species. Experiments and interpretations of data are thorough and of high quality, and identification of binding interfaces are convincing.</p><p>The physiological relevance of promiscuous RNA binding by PRC2 is not established in the literature. The authors have made great efforts to identify separation-of-function mutants that can aid in addressing the physiological function of RNA binding, but they have not applied their mutants towards such investigations. The authors report a mutant with reduced RNA binding (to approximately 25%), and it is not clear, if this reduction is sufficient to facilitate investigation into physiological relevance.</p><p>In summary, the technical quality of this study is very high and the authors address a very interesting question. Unfortunately, the authors have not used their RNA-binding PRC2 mutants to address the physiological role of RNA-binding for PRC2 function. Thus, it appears that the authors have stopped half-way, and publication in <italic>eLife</italic> cannot be recommended.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Long et al. investigated the molecular basis of RNA-binding by PRC2. Using the previously crystallized conserved catalytic core comprising EED, EZH2 and a short fragment of SUZ12 from both Chaetomium and human PRC2, they perform rigorous biochemical binding assays combined with HDX-MS mapping studies to identify residues that are important for RNA interaction. Binding studies with PRC2 versions containing mutations in these residues confirm their importance for RNA interaction. Surprisingly, the location of Chaetomium and human PRC2 amino acid residues required for RNA binding (i.e. G-quadruplex RNA) are not conserved, and they are also not located on the same surfaces in the two complexes.</p><p>This is a very nice study of excellent technical quality. The paper definitely merits to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. There is a vast amount of literature accompanied by considerable hype about RNA-binding by PRC2. Yet, as the authors state, to date it still is completely unclear whether RNA binding by PRC2 is of any physiological significance at all. The regions identified in this study will allow performing the relevant mutational analyses (i.e. EZH2 knock-in mutations in mice) to clarify this issue. Such experiments are beyond the scope of this study but will hopefully be done in the near future.</p><p>I only have a few minor comments of editorial nature that the authors should address.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>. This is radioactive signal and so it represents H3 molecules that were mono-, di- or tri-methylated in the reaction. The band should therefore be labelled as H3K27me and not as H3K27me3. Alternatively, the authors should provide WB data with an H3K27me3-specific antibody.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is not a very strong dataset. The entire figure could go into the supplement.</p><p>3) Figure 8 is a nice summary. So it would be helpful to clearly indicate in the figure that panel B is C.t. PRC2 and C is H.s. PRC2. It may also be helpful to include a C.t and H.s. EZH2 domain architecture diagram (i.e. like in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating the location of the relevant residues along the polypeptide chain.</p><p>4) Discussion, first paragraph: I don't think that the term &quot;RNA binding domain&quot; is helpful in this case. The term &quot;domain&quot; should be reserved for a portion of a protein with a defined fold. Here, the authors show that the interaction of PRC2 with RNA occurs via positively charged amino acid residues that are dispersed over a large protein surface and are not even in a conserved location on the complex when comparing C.t. and H.s. PRC2.</p><p>5) The authors state that &quot;missense mutations of some the H.s. EZH2 residues critical for RNA binding have been identified in cancer patients.&quot; The https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov website lists about 150 different amino acid changes that have been identified in EZH2 (which is a 746 amino acid protein) and almost all of them – including the residues mentioned in the text – were identified a single time and in completely different tumours. So it is not clear how meaningful these specific particular mutations are. Moreover, I assume that these are all heterozygous mutations in tumours where the homologous chromosome carries the EZH2 wild-type allele. Please clarify this in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31558.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] In summary, the technical quality of this study is very high and the authors address a very interesting question.
