states can profoundly alter the behavior of animals. A quantitative understanding of the behavioral changes upon metabolic challenges is key to a mechanistic dissection of how animals maintain nutritional homeostasis. We used an automated video tracking setup to characterize how amino acid and reproductive states interact to shape exploitation and exploration decisions taken by adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We find that these two states have specific effects on the decisions to stop at and leave proteinaceous food patches. Furthermore, the internal nutrient state defines the exploration-exploitation trade-off: nutrient-deprived flies focus on specific patches while satiated flies explore more globally. Finally, we show that olfaction mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate protein source in mated females and that octopamine is specifically required to mediate homeostatic postmating responses without affecting internal nutrient sensing. Internal states therefore modulate specific aspects of exploitation and exploration to change nutrient selection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19920.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19920.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19920.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When making decisions, animals, including humans, do not always choose the same option. One reason for this is that their “internal state” changes the value of different options. This is particularly evident when deciding what type of food to eat. Depending on which nutrients the animal needs, it will choose to eat different foods.</p><p>Amino acids are key nutrients that affect health, lifespan and reproduction. Female fruit flies that have recently mated, for example, eat more amino acids in order to obtain the raw materials required to produce eggs. Despite the importance of amino acids, little was known about how animal behavior changes in response to a lack of this nutrient.</p><p>Corrales-Carvajal et al. used a video tracking system to measure the time that fruit flies – some of which had a need for amino acids – spent feeding on patches of yeast (which are rich in amino acids) versus patches of sucrose. Recently mated females – and virgins that had been fed a diet lacking in amino acids – consumed more yeast than sucrose, whereas virgin females that were not amino acid deficient showed the opposite pattern. To bias the fly toward eating the right food for their needs, several aspects of the fly’s behavior changed, including the number and length of individual feeding bouts. These different behaviors did not all change at the same time.</p><p>The pattern of exploration taken by the flies also depended on their need for amino acids. Amino acid deficient flies spent most of their time near known yeast patches. By contrast, fully fed flies adopted a riskier foraging strategy, moving away from known sources of food to explore their environment more widely. In common with humans, the flies relied upon their sense of smell to efficiently identify different types of food.</p><p>Overall, the results presented by Corrales-Carvajal et al. provide us with a detailed understanding about how changes to the internal state of the fly affect its behavior. The next step will be to use the powerful genetic tools available for studying fruit flies to reveal the neural circuits and molecular mechanisms that help animals find the types of food that they need.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19920.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19920.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>internal states</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd><kwd>neurogenetics</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BIA-BCM/118684/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0022/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faisal</surname><given-names>Aldo A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Champalimaud Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corrales-Carvajal</surname><given-names>Verónica María</given-names></name><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship, SFRH/BD/51113/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corrales-Carvajal</surname><given-names>Verónica María</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A quantitative video tracking analysis reveals that to gain the nutrients they need, flies change their decisions to exploit foods with different nutrient contents and explore the environment according to their internal amino acid and reproductive states.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nutrition is key for optimizing the evolutionary fitness of animals. Accordingly, many organisms are able to select the nutrients that fulfill their current needs. Recent work has highlighted the importance of the balance of dietary carbohydrates and proteins/amino acids (AAs) for overall mortality, fecundity and lifespan in most species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fontana and Partridge, 2015</xref>) ranging from <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grandison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Skorupa et al., 2008</xref>) to rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Solon-Biet et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2015</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levine et al., 2014</xref>). The emerging picture is that there is a trade-off between reproduction and longevity driven by the protein-to-carbohydrate ratio in the diet: a low ratio extends lifespan but reduces reproductive output, while a high ratio reduces lifespan but promotes offspring production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simpson et al., 2015</xref>). The mechanisms by which the brain shapes behavioral output during dietary balancing to solve this ethologically relevant trade-off are still largely unknown.</p><p>Significant advances have been made in our understanding of the neural circuitry underlying decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barron et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lisman, 2015</xref>). But we are only beginning to understand how the internal state of an animal dictates the selection of specific actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sternson, 2013</xref>). This question becomes particularly relevant in value-based decision making, such as nutrient balancing, where the value of the available options is dependent on the current needs of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itskov and Ribeiro, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012</xref>). Thus, the behavioral strategies animals use to adapt nutrient decisions to their internal states provide an ethologically relevant framework to understand how internal states change behavior to mediate value-based decisions.</p><p>The fly has emerged as an important model to study complex computational tasks due to the availability of sophisticated genetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>), a numerically simple nervous system, and the advent of methods to quantitatively characterize behavior. Advanced computational tools have been applied successfully in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to study for example chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Breugel and Dickinson, 2014</xref>), action mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berman et al., 2014</xref>), aggression and courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dankert et al., 2009</xref>), fly-fly interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>), and predator avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muijres et al., 2014</xref>). This recent quantitative approach to behavioral analysis has given rise to the field of computational ethology: the use of computerized tools to measure behavior automatically, to characterize and describe it quantitatively, and to explore patterns which can explain the principles governing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Perona, 2014</xref>). When combined with powerful genetic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>) the fine description of behavior afforded by these methods will allow us to make significant steps forward in our understanding of the neuronal circuits and molecular pathways that mediate behavior.</p><p>Flies can detect and behaviorally compensate for the lack or imbalance of proteins and amino acids in the food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjordal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>) and adapt their salt and protein intake to their current mating state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). The current nutrient state is thought to be read out directly by the nervous system through the action of nutrient-sensitive mechanisms such as the TOR and GCN2 pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjordal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chantranupong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>). Mating acts on salt and yeast appetite via the action of male-derived Sex Peptide acting on the Sex Peptide Receptor in female reproductive tract neurons, and the resultant silencing of downstream SAG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). SAG neurons have been proposed to then change chemosensory processing to modify nutrient intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). The recent development of technologies that can measure the flies’ feeding behavior quantitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>) gives access to the fine structure of the feeding program, and how flies homeostatically modulate this program according to their internal state. However, the further structure of foraging decisions, such as arriving at or leaving a specific food patch, and how flies balance the trade-off between exploiting a needed nutrient resource and exploring the surrounding environment to discover new resources, is still poorly understood. Understanding how internal states change the behavioral strategies of an animal should allow us to understand how the animal manages to maintain nutrient homeostasis.</p><p>Here, we developed a quantitative value-based decision making paradigm to study the foraging strategies implemented by adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to reach protein homeostasis. We use an automated video tracking setup to characterize the exploitation and exploration of sucrose and yeast patches by flies in different dietary amino acid and mating states. We found that metabolic state and mating modulate the decisions to stop at a yeast patch and leave it. Furthermore, we describe how the internal deficit of dietary amino acids increases exploitation of proteinaceous patches and restricts global exploration and how these behaviors dynamically shift towards increasing exploration as the fly reaches satiation. Importantly, we provide two examples on how our paradigm can be used in the dissection of the genetic and neuronal mechanisms underlying nutrient decisions: First, we show that olfaction is not required to reach protein homeostasis, but that it mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate food source in mated females. Second, we show that octopamine mediates homeostatic postmating responses, but not the effects of internal sensing of amino acid deprivation state. Our study provides a quantitative description of how the fly changes behavioral decisions to achieve homeostatic nutrient balancing as well as initial insights into the mechanisms underlying protein homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Automated monitoring of nutrient choices using image-based tracking</title><p>Animals are able to adapt their feeding preference towards a particular food in response to their current needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dethier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffioen-Roose et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itskov and Ribeiro, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Warwick et al., 2009</xref>).

We recorded the behavior of the fly over two hours during these nutritional decisions, and developed custom software to track the position of the fly’s body and head centroids (all tracking data generated in this study are available for download from the Dryad repository [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>]).

In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zou et al., 2011</xref>), we found that more than 80% of the speeds displayed during manually annotated resting or walking periods were below 0.2 mm/s or above 2 mm/s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, we reasoned that micromovements could correspond to either grooming or feeding. Indeed, 70% of grooming fell in the micromovement category; while for manually-annotated feeding bouts, half of these periods were categorized as micromovements, the other half occurred at low speeds and were thus classified as resting. However, flies showed a very low rate of proboscis extension during feeding bouts at &lt;0.2 mm/s (data not shown) and we therefore reasoned that these slow bouts had little contribution to the amount of food ingested. For this reason, we decided to use the time the fly was performing micromovements when its head was in contact with the food patch as a proxy for the time the fly spent feeding (henceforth termed <italic>yeast micromovements</italic> or <italic>sucrose micromovements</italic>). To strengthen the argument that these micromovement periods within a food patch represented mostly feeding bouts and not grooming, we used the annotated video segments to quantify the percentage of feeding and grooming during a food micromovement bout. Indeed, we observed that 92.2% of the yeast micromovements and 70.6% of the sucrose micromovements corresponded to feeding bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Hence <italic>sucrose</italic> and <italic>yeast micromovements</italic> are a good way to capture the periods the fly spends feeding on a food patch.</p><p>To start exploring how flies with different internal states react to the different foods, we used this metric to characterize the behavior of virgin and mated females that were previously fed a rich diet. Virgin flies displayed a preference for sucrose over yeast over the total time of the assay, while the opposite was observed in mated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>). A closer look at the duration of micromovements on the two food sources, revealed very similar duration profiles between yeast and sucrose for virgin females, while a higher prevalence of long events (≥20 s) on yeast when compared to sucrose was observed in mated flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and H</xref>). These results suggest that for mated females, yeast has a higher salience as food source, even in fully-fed conditions. These observations are in accord with previous reports showing that mating leads to a switch in yeast preference in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the analysis of food micromovements allows us to capture previously-described changes in food preference elicited by mating. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that one way in which mating increases yeast preference is by inducing long feeding bouts, allowing us to make first conclusions about the behavioral mechanisms behind changes in food choice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Flies increase yeast feeding and micromovements in response to amino acid challenges and mating</title><p>A key question in nutritional neuroscience is how animals homeostatically compensate for the lack of specific nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dethier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itskov and Ribeiro, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012</xref>). A concrete example of this homeostatic regulation of feeding behavior is the robust increase in preference for yeast when flies are deprived of proteinaceous food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>).

As the number of sips correlates strongly with food intake, this method enabled us to precisely measure the impact of internal states on feeding decisions. Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walker et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), virgin flies showed very little interest in yeast during the whole assay, as measured by the total number of yeast sips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bi</xref>). Yeast feeding increased with AA deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bii</xref>), and mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Biii</xref>). Notably, AA-challenged mated females showed a strong increase in the number of yeast sips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Biv and v</xref>) with the highest rate of yeast feeding in mated flies completely deprived of AAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bv</xref>). We next asked whether these differences in feeding behavior could be captured using the yeast and sucrose micromovements measured using the tracking setup. Indeed, we observed that the yeast micromovements increased in the same way as the yeast sips after AA challenges in virgin and mated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Importantly none of these internal state changes led to an increase in the total number of sucrose sips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or in the total duration of sucrose micromovements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), highlighting the dietary specificity of the manipulation and allowing us to focus our subsequent analysis on the fly’s behavior towards yeast patches. Flies are therefore capable of sensing deficits in AAs and of compensating by specifically increasing feeding and micromovements on yeast, an AA-rich substrate. Furthermore, this homeostatic response is modulated by the mating state of the fly. Our tracking approach is therefore now a validated strategy to uncover the changes in behavioral strategies elicited by different internal states and how these changes allow the animal to reach homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Flies show high inter-individual variability in the response to yeast</title><p>We investigated the dynamics of yeast micromovements by comparing the ethogram of each individual fly along the two hours of the assay and across all the internal state conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, yeast micromovements are shown in yellow). This type of visualization revealed that the behavior towards yeast was highly variable. The observed increase in the total duration of yeast micromovements across the different internal state conditions seems to come from the combination of two factors: on one hand, the proportion of flies that showed any interest in yeast at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and on the other hand, the strength of the interest displayed by these flies, measured by the total duration of yeast micromovements. The behavior towards yeast was also highly variable across individuals of the same condition. For example, the total duration of yeast micromovements displayed by AA-deprived flies ranged from 5 to 59 min. Still, the initial steep increase in yeast micromovements during the first 30 min of the assay was very consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ev</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, the variability increased as a function of deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The reaction to internal state changes is therefore highly variable across individuals. However, full AA deprivation in mated females leads to a robust population-wide effect, highlighting the importance of AAs for the animal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Metabolic state and mating modulate the probability of stopping at a yeast patch and leaving it</title><p>To feed, flies need to stay on food patches. We decided to call these events <italic>visits</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A <italic>visit</italic> is defined as all consecutive bouts of micromovements on the same patch, for as long as the fly stayed in close proximity of the patch. As we observed in the total duration of yeast micromovements, the total duration of yeast visits increased as a result of mating and AA deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the fly increases yeast intake by changing different aspects of its foraging decisions, such as <italic>approaching</italic> a patch more often, <italic>stopping at</italic> it more and/or <italic>leaving</italic> it less often. We measured approaching, stopping and leaving decisions by quantifying the number of encounters, the fraction of encounters in which the fly stops on a patch (<italic>visits</italic>) and the duration of visits, respectively. One easy way to increase the total time on yeast would be to approach yeast patches more often. However, none of the internal state modifications leading to an increase in yeast intake caused an increase in the total number of yeast encounters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the rate of encounters remains constant across internal states, with the exception of the mated fully AA-deprived females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which had a low absolute number of encounters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Surprisingly, pre-feeding mated flies with the suboptimal diet caused a dramatic increase in the probability of stopping at a yeast patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The strong effect on the decision to stop shows that flies are able to homeostatically modify their behavior in response to even subtle dietary differences that have a negative impact on their fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Piper et al., 2013</xref>).

This was also the case for the strategies each mated fly chose to compensate for both AA challenges. We observed that these flies reached the same total times on yeast by mixing strategies in different ways: some flies had fewer but longer visits, while others had a higher number of visits, but each visit was shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Taken together, these data show that both metabolic and mating states significantly change the decisions to stop at a yeast patch and leave it. Furthermore, the strongest effect is observed when both states act together, as seen in AA-challenged mated females. The specific behavioral strategy each fly employs to reach homeostasis, however, varies widely.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The lack of dietary AAs increases exploitation and local exploration of yeast patches</title><p>We have shown that AA deprivation leads to a 1.6-fold increase in yeast feeding when compared to the suboptimal diet treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Surprisingly, however, a change of this magnitude is not visible in the total duration of the yeast visits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), nor is this homeostatic effect recapitulated in changes in specific foraging decisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We therefore speculated that instead of modulating exploratory decisions, a lack of AAs could increase the motivation of the flies to exploit the yeast patch. Indeed, the time course of yeast visits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) shows that AA-deprived flies displayed a sharp increase in the total duration of yeast visits during the first minutes, while flies pre-fed a suboptimal AA diet displayed a much more delayed and shallower increase in this parameter.

These data suggest that AA-deprived flies are not only more motivated to start exploiting a yeast patch but are also more active while on the food patch.</p><p>This was further supported when we quantified locomotor activity during each visit to yeast. As visible in the two example trajectories displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, we observed that deprived flies were more active, displaying higher linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>) and angular speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Accordingly, these flies had fewer resting bouts and more sharp turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). These changes in behavior observed on the food patch were only induced by a complete lack of AAs, as there was no difference in these parameters between mated females pre-fed the rich diet versus those pre-fed the suboptimal diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). All these data are in agreement with an increase in yeast exploitation upon full AA deprivation. Flies lacking AAs would be more 'eager' to exploit and therefore ingest yeast, leading to a strong increase in yeast feeding as observed using the flyPAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Animals homeostatically increase food intake upon food deprivation, by changing the micro-structure of their feeding motor pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis and Smith, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). As video tracking does not give us access to the fine structure of the proboscis motor program, we used the flyPAD technology to characterize the changes in the microstructure of feeding upon AA deprivation. Pre-feeding flies a suboptimal diet led to a decrease only in the inter-burst-interval (IBI) when compared to flies kept on a rich diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>) while the number of sips in each feeding burst did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Full AA deprivation, however, led to a strong increase in the number of sips per burst with only a mild further decrease in the IBI. These effects are very similar to those observed upon mating in yeast-deprived females, which leads to both a decrease in the inter-burst interval and an increase in the number of yeast sips per burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walker et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The volume ingested during a feeding bout is a product of the duration of that bout and the feeding rate. Therefore, we analyzed the rhythmic feeding motor pattern and observed that it was only slightly modified by dietary AA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>). The mode of the inter-sip-interval distributions decreased from 0.08 s in mated females pre-fed the rich diet to 0.07 s when pre-fed the suboptimal diet (p=0.0045, Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Bonferroni correction), while no further change was observed when they were pre-fed the AA− diet (0.07 s, p=1). However, the mode of the sip duration distributions did not change when mated flies pre-fed a suboptimal diet were compared to females kept on a rich diet (0.12 s, p=0.1196), but it decreased when flies were pre-fed the AA− diet (0.11 s, p=0.0067). Taken together, while AA deprivation has minimal effects on the decision to stop at a proteinaceous food patch and leave it, this metabolic manipulation leads to drastic changes in its exploitation. The described changes in activity are likely to support an increased intake of the yeast resource, which is further promoted by a change in the feeding motor pattern of the fly. The increase in exploitation can also be interpreted as an increase in local, resource-directed exploration which could aid the micro-optimization of food intake within non-homogenous natural food patches.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Amino acid challenges reduce global exploration and increase revisits to the same yeast patch</title><p>The data presented above clearly demonstrate that different internal states interact to modulate food exploitation.

Fully-fed flies therefore display a high rate of global exploratory activity, traveling larger distances during their transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) and mainly choosing to visit distant food patches (as in the example trace). Challenging flies with a suboptimal diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) or one lacking all AAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) significantly altered their exploratory behavior: they strongly reduced their probability of transitioning to distant yeast patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and increased the probability of transitioning to adjacent yeast patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Further, in contrast to the fully-fed flies, AA-challenged flies showed a strong increase in their probability of returning to the same yeast patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). As one would expect, these changes in behavior are also seen as a decrease in the average distance traveled by animals during transitions to yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Dietary AA challenges therefore lead to a switch from global to local exploration (see example traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). One of the most striking changes is the strong increase in returns to the same yeast patch upon AA deprivation. This change in exploratory strategy leads to an effective additional increase in the time on the same yeast patch without requiring a change in the decision to leave it. Taken together, these changes in exploratory strategy should enable the fly to efficiently increase the intake of yeast while minimizing the distance traveled to the next patch. It also allows the fly to focus on a resource whose quality she knows while avoiding testing food patches of unknown qualities, thereby reducing exploratory risk.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Flies dynamically adapt their exploitatory and exploratory behavior to their internal AA state</title><p>If yeast exploitation and exploration are indeed regulated by the internal AA state of the fly, we hypothesized that flies should dynamically adapt their behavior as their internal state changes over the course of the assay due to satiation.

As a proof of principle of how our setup could be used to uncover the neuronal mechanisms underlying foraging decisions, we decided to analyze the role of olfaction in nutrient homeostasis. Olfactory sensory neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> express two main types of chemosensory receptors: Odorant Receptors (OR) and Ionotropic glutamate receptors (IRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rytz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>).

However, upon closer inspection of the time course of yeast visits, we observed that flies with impaired olfaction had a very long latency to engage in a long yeast visit when compared to the genetic controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

But which behavioral alterations underlie such changes in preference? Here we use an automated video tracking setup to quantitatively capture the behavioral adaptations to AA and mating state changes that allow the animal to maintain nutrient homeostasis. We started by separating the behaviors flies display towards food into discrete decisions: the decision to approach a food patch, the decision to stop at it, and the decision to leave it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Strikingly, mating and AA challenges induced compensatory behaviors towards yeast patches but not sucrose patches, indicating that the fly changes its exploitation decisions in a resource specific way. Furthermore, internal state modifications impact specific decisions to a different extent. While mating had a major effect on the probability of a fly leaving a yeast patch, AA challenges strongly increased the probability of stopping at a food patch. Nevertheless, the effect of AA deprivation on the decision to stop at a food patch was strongly dependent on mating suggesting that both internal states act synergistically to increase yeast intake. Furthermore, while full AA deprivation leads to a strong increase in yeast feeding when compared to flies kept on a suboptimal diet, the described decisions were not further altered by this drastic nutritional manipulation. There was, however, a considerable decrease in the latency to visit yeast patches for a long time and a general increase in parameters related to the 'eagerness' of the fly to exploit the resource (latency to engage on a yeast visit, locomotor activity on the patch and area of patch covered). Internal states, therefore, alter feeding in specific ways, allowing the fly either to spend more time on the food through the modulation of patch decisions, or to increase resource exploitation through the modulation of motivation without changing patch decisions. These specific changes allow the animal to dose its exploitatory behavior and hence the intake of nutrients over a large range (~17 fold) to match its current needs.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19920.024</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of behavioral strategies modulated by internal AA state.</title><p>We propose a model in which virgin flies with high internal levels of AAs display low intake mostly ignore yeast patches upon encounter and have a high probability of leaving the yeast patch upon stopping at it.

Such modularity has been previously described in the organization of motor output, such as locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiehn, 2016</xref>), swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2013</xref>), grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>), and feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). This accumulated evidence suggests that the nervous system uses different mechanisms and hence circuits to change specific aspects of behavioral outcomes or decisions and that these changes add up to reach a specific goal. In agreement with this model, it has been shown that the impact of different starvation times on gustatory input relies on different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, our data show that octopamine is specifically required for mediating the changes in yeast decisions observed upon mating but not upon AA deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Nevertheless, some decisions, such as the decision to stop at a yeast patch, seem to be synergistically gated by both the mating and the AA state of the fly. It will be interesting to dissect how different internal states act at the circuit level to change behavioral decisions: do they act differentially on specific neuronal populations, or is the observed synergism a reflection of the different internal states acting on the same set of neurons?</p><p>While at the population level the effect of internal state manipulations led to stereotypical changes in behavior, the effect of internal state on the decisions implemented varied greatly at the individual level. This effect is reminiscent of the large individual differences observed in human physiology in response to identical diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zeevi et al., 2015</xref>). While such behavioral differences can stem from different metabolic states prior to the experiment, transgenerational effects in metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Öst et al., 2014</xref>), or differences in the microbiota of the flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broderick and Lemaitre, 2012</xref>), there is a real possibility that they also reflect idiosyncrasies in behavior and metabolic susceptibilities to internal state changes at the individual level. Indeed, upon AA challenges, we observed that some flies increased their total time on yeast by having many short yeast visits, while some flies had fewer but longer visits. It will be interesting to investigate if these differences reflect behavioral idiosyncrasies, as observed before in many animals including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchanan and de Bivort, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dingemanse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kain and de Bivort, 2012</xref>). Differentiating between these two possibilities and identifying the physiological and circuit mechanisms leading to idiosyncrasies will be key to a better understanding of behavior. This is especially relevant for understanding metabolic conditions related to nutrition such as obesity.</p><p>In order to balance the intake of specific nutrients the animal should be able to specifically change its decisions towards the food source which contains the nutrient it needs. Our data show that this is indeed the case, pointing to a possible important contribution of chemosensory systems to nutrient decisions. Indeed, taste processing has been shown to be changed by the mating state of the animal and to contribute to the adaptation of behavioral decisions such as food choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walker et al., 2015</xref>) and egg laying site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hussain et al., 2016</xref>). The contribution of olfaction to nutrient selection is less well understood. The sense of smell is thought to be mostly important for food search behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becher et al., 2010</xref>), with starvation changing olfactory sensitivity to improve the finding of a food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Our data suggest that while olfactory-impaired mated flies are able to homeostatically increase yeast intake upon AA deprivation, OR-mediated olfaction still plays an important role in their capacity to do so. Interestingly, olfaction doesn’t seem to be important for locating the food but for identifying yeast as an appropriate food source. These data suggest that flies use multimodal integration to decide which food to ingest. In humans, flavor, the integration of different sensory modalities such as taste and smell, is key to the perception of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Verhagen and Engelen, 2006</xref>). Similarly, in mosquitoes olfaction acts together with other sensory cues to initiate a meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>). Identifying the chemosensory basis for yeast feeding decisions might therefore be a powerful way to investigate the neuronal basis of flavor perception.</p><p>While one would expect that internal states increase food intake by changing exploitation decisions, their effects on exploratory behaviors in our paradigm are not trivial. Exploration is key for animals to find the resources they require and to acquire information about their surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calhoun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hassell and Shouthwood, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hills et al., 2015</xref>). In our paradigm, however, animals do not need to search for resources as they are readily available. A key question then becomes why animals leave a food patch at all, especially when they are deprived of AAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The fact that they still do so means that there is a value in leaving the current food patch, even if that one provides the urgently required nutrients to produce offspring and has not been depleted yet. We can only speculate that there must be an advantage in taking the 'risk' of exploring unknown options and maybe identifying a better resource. Animals might often require other resources and leaving the current food patch might allow them to also explore the availability of these. Flies seem to nevertheless manage their exposure to uncertainty by tuning the spatial properties of their exploration. Their internal states not only define the probability of leaving a food patch, they also define if they will explore locally or more globally. The more deprived they are, the more local their exploratory pattern will be (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Remarkably, while the leaving probability of flies pre-exposed to a suboptimal AA diet and a diet lacking AAs looks identical, their exploratory patterns are very different. For example, AA-deprived flies display a higher rate of returns to the same patch right after leaving it. Therefore, while the neuronal processes determining staying decisions seem not to be altered between both AA-challenged states, full AA deprivation must act on the circuits controlling exploration to strongly increase the probability of revisiting the patch the fly just left. This allows the fly to de facto stay longer on the same food patch without changing its leaving decisions. We would like to propose that the apparent separate regulation of these two aspects of the fly behavior suggests that there are two separate internal state sensing processes regulating exploitation and exploration decisions. The combination of both behavioral and circuit modules would allow the fly to trade off the requirement to exploit specific resources and the 'risk' of exposing itself to resources of unknown or lower quality. Furthermore, it is interesting to note the similarity between the revisits to the same food patch we observed upon strong AA deprivation and the 'dances' observed by Vincent Dethier in the blowfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dethier, 1976</xref>). Both phenomena are examples of how animals regulate their search behavior and exposure to uncertainty by modulating the local dynamics of their exploratory behavior, in a state-dependent manner. While the budget theory is a classic aspect of foraging theory, it has recently started to be reassessed. It is mainly controversial if energy-deprived animals, including humans, are more or less risk-prone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kacelnik and El Mouden, 2013</xref>). Our data suggest that the exploratory behavior of AA-deprived animals minimizes their exposure to uncertainty. The description of how different aspects of risk management are implemented at the behavioral level opens up the opportunity to identify the circuit mechanisms by which internal states control exploration-exploitation trade-offs and therefore how animals decide how much to expose themselves to the unknown.</p><p>The success of neurogenetics has relied to a large extent on the use of simple binary end-point behavioral assays to perform large-scale unbiased screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leitão-gonçalves and Ribeiro, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ugur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vosshall, 2007</xref>). This approach has allowed the field to make important contributions to the molecular and circuit basis of innumerable phenomena, including learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heisenberg, 2015</xref>), chronobiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</xref>), innate behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Demir and Dickson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yapici et al., 2008</xref>), and sensory physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>). While identifying these cornerstones of neuroscience was crucial, we are now in a position to start understanding how these mechanisms act at the circuit level to perform more complex computations such as the ones used during decision-making and exploration. This endeavor requires the use of a richer and dynamic description and analysis of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomez-Marin et al., 2014</xref>). We used a combination of computer vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Perona, 2014</xref>) and a quantitative, automated capacitance-based behavioral assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>) with internal state and genetic manipulations to characterize and identify the behavioral changes allowing the animal to achieve homeostasis. It is interesting to consider that while we identify an important role of OR-mediated olfaction in nutrient decision-making, this would not have been possible using end-point analyses, as the animal manages to compensate for its sensory challenge using alternative means. The use of dynamic, quantitative descriptions of complex behavior therefore enables neuroscientists to decompose these into discrete processes, opening up the possibility to go beyond assigning circuits and molecules to general behaviors to start explaining how they act to control the generation of complex cognitive processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks, genetics and rearing conditions</title><p>Unless stated otherwise all experiments were performed with <italic>Canton S</italic> female flies. <italic>Canton S</italic> flies were obtained from the Bloomington stock center. <italic>Orco<sup>1/1 </sup></italic>flies were a kind gift of Sofia Lavista-Llanos from the Hansson laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Orco<sup>1/+ </sup></italic>flies were obtained by crossing <italic>Canton</italic> S virgins with <italic>Orco<sup>1/1 </sup></italic>males. <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18 </sup></italic>flies were a kind gift of Scott Waddell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monastirioti et al., 1996</xref>).

Material used for the base was acrylic and glass for the lid. The outer diameter of the arena was 73 mm. The inner area containing food patches was flat and had a diameter of 50 mm and a distance to the lid of 2.1 mm. To allow a top-view of the fly throughout the whole experiment, the outer area of the arena had 10° of inclination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Simon and Dickinson, 2010</xref>) and the glass lid was coated with 10 µL of SigmaCote the night before the assays. Food patches were distributed in two concentric circles equidistantly from the edge. Furthermore, sucrose and yeast patches were alternated such that from a given food patch, there was at least one adjacent yeast and one adjacent sucrose patch. The radius of each food patch was approximately 1.5 mm. The minimum distance between the centers of two adjacent food patches is 10 mm. White LEDs 12V DC (4.8 watt/meter), were used for illumination of the arenas.

The arena diameter in the video was measured to find the correspondence between pixels in the video and mm in the real world (1 pixel = 0.155 mm). The typical length of the major axis of the fly body in a video was 19 pixels (~3 mm). Video acquisition was made with slight overexposure to obtain a strong contrast between the fly and the arena. Since the fly body was the darkest object in the arena, a pixel intensity threshold was used to obtain the centroid and orientation of the fly blob. The head position was extracted using custom MATLAB (Mathworks) software. Head position in the first frame was manually selected. From there on, the head position is automatically propagated to the consecutive frames using a proximity rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</xref>). This rule, however, does not hold during a jump of the fly. Therefore, in addition to the proximity rule, for the intervals in-between jumps, the head position was automatically corrected using the fact that flies walk forward most of the time. Manual annotation of 510 inter-jump-intervals revealed that 98% were correctly classified. All the body and head centroid tracking data generated in this study are available for download from the Dryad repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral classification</title><p>Raw trajectories of head and body centroids were smoothed using a Gaussian filter of 16 frames (0.32 s) width. The width was chosen empirically by comparing the raw and smoothed tracks. The speed was measured from the smoothed coordinates by calculating the distance covered from the current frame and the next frame, divided by the time between them (0.02 s). Similarly, the angular speed was measured by calculating the difference between the heading angle from the current frame and the next frame, divided by the time between them. The heading angle for this calculation was obtained from the head and tail smoothed centroids. Walking and non-walking instances were classified applying a 2 mm/s threshold in the head speed, based on the distribution of head speed for AA-deprived flies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robie et al., 2010</xref>). The head speed used was also smoothed using a Gaussian filter of 60 frames (1.2 s) to avoid rapid changes in classification around the thresholds. Sharp turns were classified when a local maximum in the angular speed exceeded a 125°/s threshold, as long as the body centroid speed was below 4 mm/s. A wider Gaussian filter (width of 2.4 s) was applied to the head speed to classify resting bouts, using a threshold of 0.2 mm/s. The remaining events during the non-walking segments that were not classified as resting were classified as micromovements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Food encounters, micromovements, and visits</title><p>Manual annotation of 107 feeding events showed that when the head position was at 3 mm or less from the center of the food patch, flies were already close enough to have leg contact. Initially, <italic>encounters</italic> with a food patch were defined as the moments in which the fly crossed this 3 mm distance threshold. To avoid misclassifying the transient head movement associated with grooming or feeding around this threshold as new encounters, consecutive encounters were merged when the total displacement of the head in any direction was lower or equal than 2 pixels (0.31 mm) during the time elapsed in-between the encounters. From each feeding event, the distance from the head of the fly to the center of the patch was also captured. Since 95% of the first proboscis extensions happened below 2.5 mm, this was the selected distance threshold to define <italic>yeast</italic> and <italic>sucrose micromovements</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In this way, food micromovements were defined as the time in which flies were classified in a micromovement (see definition in previous section) and their head was simultaneously inside a circle of 2.5 mm around the food patch (see gray dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> inset). The two pixels displacement rule used in the definition of encounters was also applied here to avoid definitions of false new micromovements. A <italic>visit</italic> was defined as a series of consecutive food micromovements (already corrected for small displacements) in which the head distance to the center of the food patch was never larger than 5 mm during the time elapsed in-between the food micromovements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> inset). 5 mm is the maximum radius of non-overlapping circles around the food patches (see gray dashed line in main trajectory of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This 5 mm threshold was also used to merge consecutive encounters (consecutive encounters were merged if the head distance to the center of the food patch was never larger than 5 mm during the time in-between encounters). In this way, for every visit there is an encounter, but there can be an encounter and no visit if the fly doesn’t stop at the food patch (food micromovement).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Exploitation, exploration and locomotor activity parameters</title><p>All of these parameters, unless specified otherwise, were calculated for each fly and for the whole duration of the assay.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><bold>Yeast</bold> (or sucrose) <bold>micromovements</bold>: Events in which the fly was micromoving (0.2 mm/s &lt; head speed &lt; 2 mm/s, see <italic>Behavioral classification</italic> section for details) on the food patch (head position ≤ 2.5 mm from the center of the food patch).</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Total duration of yeast</bold> (or sucrose) <bold>micromovements</bold> (<bold>min</bold>): Sum of the durations of all yeast (or sucrose) micromovements.

Given that the experimental design was such as to remove (to a great degree) the effects of search, and rather to focus on the behavior of flies once on a patch, the analysis focused on the decisions to engage and to leave (as opposed to find) patches.

This is more by way of a comment than a suggestion: the point is introduced and to some extent tested, but it is worth pointing out somewhere that the volume ingested during a feeding bout (meal) is a product of the duration of the feeding bout and the rate at which food is ingested across the meal. Meal size (and its volumetric and other determinants) has been shown in some insect systems to be positively correlated with ingestion rate and affected by common inputs (both homeostatic and non-homeostatic) (e.g. Animal Behav. 36: 1216-27). Hence, meal duration (which is estimated in the present set up) tends to be a more conserved variable than meal size (a fly can eat more by ingesting faster over the same meal duration). Changes in ingestion rate can result from greater amplitude of feeding central pattern generator (and hence motor) output, or greater frequency of rhythm, or through a change in intra-meal burst and interval structure. The data reported address and show a contribution from the latter, but changes in both amplitude and frequency of CPG output are also known.</p><p>In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “The lack of dietary AAs increases exploitation and local exploration of yeast patches”.– 'intake' rather than 'use', which is a vague term. There are numerous other instances throughout the manuscript of faintly teleological terminology – &quot;decision&quot;, &quot;engage&quot;, &quot;exploitation&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;choose to visit distant patches&quot;, etc. In such a beautiful analysis of behaviour as this, I would rather see clear, objective description. Maybe I'm being a pedant on this, but J.S. Kennedy (The New Anthropomorphism, 1993, CUP) was spot on in my view.</p><p>The one counter-intuitive finding is that reported in the subsection “Amino acid challenges reduce global exploration and increase revisits to the same yeast patch”. My understanding is that theory and experiment (Levy flight; intrinsic (local) search vs. extrinsic search (ranging); Dethier's fly dance, etc.) predicts that flies should stay nearby &quot;high quality&quot; patches and roam more extensively when on &quot;lower quality&quot; patches. Staying nearby to an imbalanced food source when in a state of AA imbalance and roaming globally when AA balanced appears contrary to expectations and suggests something interesting, perhaps about the evolved predicted spatial distribution of protein resources in the environment, e.g. complementary imbalanced AA sources are likely to be close by to one another. In the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection there is an unconvincing statement on this issue, which needs some more thought I think.</p><p>Subsection “ORs mediate efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate food source”. This section could be set up by referencing back to the observation reported earlier that arrival rates at food sources was not impacted by state – implying that olfactory cues acting over a distance are not involved, but close-range chemosensory cues (short-range olfactory and gustatory) are more likely. Would help build the narrative.</p><p>The Discussion is where you need to address the matter mentioned above in the subsection “Amino acid challenges reduce global exploration and increase revisits to the same yeast patch”. The blowfly dance results seem at odds with present findings – flies dance more vigorously and stay longer locally after stimulation with a higher concentration food source. The same is the case for bees and other animals (William Bell's work – e.g. see his 1990 book). It is true that greater levels of deprivation elicit greater local dancing to a given food; but still the effect is strongly dependent on food quality relative to state.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Ribeiro's group uses this paper to establish a new assay to assess the relationships between internal state defined by the interaction between sexual experience (mated or virgin) and metabolic experience (more or less amino acids in the medium) on behaviour (explore or exploit). I like the analysis very much and I think it will be a welcome addition to the literature. Their method includes potential to dissect decision-making at the level of behavior and offers a world of new possibilities for evaluating the contribution of genes, development, and physiology to behavior. They note and promise that they are providing insight into mechanism as well and this part of the paper pales when compared to the behavioral analysis. The nod to mechanism occurs via the manipulation of <italic>Orco</italic> to demonstrate a role for smell in the behavioural strategy used by mated females. Not clear that it plays a role for the virgins because there are no data and it seems less likely but entirely possible that olfaction is used to detect or evaluate sugars. I do not think more experiments need to be performed but I think the <italic>Orco</italic> data provide more of a proof of principle than an exposition of mechanism and the paper would be improved if these data were presented that way. This same point applies to the tyramine β hydroxylase experiments. The paper is written as if these data provide insight into the brain, but there are no experiments to show that brain octopamine as opposed to octopamine in the ventral nerve cord are responsible for the effects. Again, I am not suggesting that this already long manuscript needs more data, only that the nod to mechanism is more of statement of possibility than indication of genetic pathways, anatomic pathways, or neuronal circuits. The paper is more than just a &quot;methods paper&quot; because of the insights provided by this analysis of effects of environment on foraging, reproductive behavior and, potentially, decision making. The readers of <italic>eLife</italic> will like this one.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19920.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>It is felt that the link to neural mechanism is rather a 'proof of principle', and does not go deep into the mechanism as may be possible with this model system.

In the revised version we have modified the Introduction, the <italic>Orco</italic> manipulation section, the octopamine section and the Discussion to highlight this more clearly. We highlight the specific changes below and in the answers to the comments to each reviewer:</p><p>We have modified the second part of the last paragraph of the Introduction to highlight that the two mutation experiments <italic>are examples</italic> of the potential of our setup to dissect the underlying neuronal mechanisms of the behavior under study. We also removed the word “mechanistic” and described our results from the mutation experiments as “initial insights”:</p><p>“Importantly, we provide two examples on how our paradigm can be used in the dissection of the genetic and neuronal mechanisms underlying nutrient decisions: First, we show that olfaction is not required to reach protein homeostasis, but that it mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate food source in mated females. Second, we show that octopamine mediates homeostatic postmating responses, but not the effects of internal sensing of amino acid deprivation state. Our study provides a quantitative description of how the fly changes behavioral decisions to achieve homeostatic nutrient balancing as well as initial insights into the mechanisms underlying protein homeostasis.”</p><p>The first paragraph of the <italic>Orco</italic> manipulation section now clearly states that this experiment is a proof of principle:</p><p>“As a proof of principle of how our setup could be used to uncover the neuronal mechanisms underlying foraging decisions, we decided to analyze the role of olfaction in nutrient homeostasis.”</p><p>To clarify that the results from the octopamine manipulation do not give us specific insights about the brain, we state that the <italic>Tβh</italic> manipulation affects the whole animal. We also added &quot;to show that our setup could be used&quot; to this sentence to highlight the fact that these experiments are more about exploring the usefulness of the tracking approach than an in depth exploration of molecular mechanisms:</p><p>“We therefore decided to show that our setup could be used to test possible neuromodulatory effects of octopamine on yeast foraging, using mutants for the gene encoding Tyramine β-hydroxylase (TβH), an enzyme required for the biosynthesis of octopamine in the whole animal.”</p><p>And in the last paragraph of the octopamine section, we highlight that this is just a “first step” in the dissection of the mechanisms:</p><p>“These results provide a first step towards dissecting the role of octopamine in nutrient homeostasis.”</p><p>We have added the word “behavioral” to emphasize that we are referring to the behavioral and not neuronal mechanisms: “Furthermore, these results demonstrate that one way in which mating increases yeast preference is by inducing long feeding bouts, allowing us to make first conclusions about the behavioral mechanisms behind changes in food choice”.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This paper addresses the very important challenge of identifying key drivers of nutritional decision-making using Drosophila as a tractable model organism.

I pick up on the precision of language a little more below.</italic> </p><p>We agree the word “engaging the food” might not be the best option. In our opinion what is important is to use a terminology that clearly differentiates between the animal stopping at the food and not moving at all (“resting”) and the animal stopping but being still active (e.g. “micromoving”). As &quot;stop at&quot; should be clear enough we have decided to follow your recommendation and use the term “stop at” the food patch instead of “engaging” the food patch. We have changed the manuscript and the figures accordingly.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “The lack of dietary AAs increases exploitation and local exploration of yeast patches”. This is more by way of a comment than a suggestion: the point is introduced and to some extent tested, but it is worth pointing out somewhere that the volume ingested during a feeding bout (meal) is a product of the duration of the feeding bout and the rate at which food is ingested across the meal.

The data reported address and show a contribution from the latter, but changes in both amplitude and frequency of CPG output are also known.</italic> </p><p>While food intake can theoretically be increased by an increase in the frequency of the feeding rhythm we had not found any evidence for such an effect in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in a previous study (Itskov et al., Nature Communications, 2014). However, a careful analysis of the feeding rhythm data of the experiments in this manuscript revealed very small effects of internal states on sip durations and inter-sip-intervals. The effects are very small but we have decided to change the manuscript to include these data. In the two new panels D and E of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, we now analyze the effect of internal state on the feeding rhythm. We have added the following text to describe the observed effects:</p><p>“The volume ingested during a feeding bout is a product of the duration of that bout and the feeding rate. […] However, the mode of the sip duration distributions did not change when mated flies pre-fed a suboptimal diet were compared to females kept on a rich diet (0.12 s, <italic>p</italic> = 0.1196), but it decreased when flies were pre-fed the AA- diet (0.11 s, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0067).”</p><p><italic>In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “The lack of dietary AAs increases exploitation and local exploration of yeast patches” – 'intake' rather than 'use', which is a vague term. There are numerous other instances throughout the manuscript of faintly teleological terminology – &quot;decision&quot;, &quot;engage&quot;, &quot;exploitation&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;choose to visit distant patches&quot;, etc. In such a beautiful analysis of behaviour as this, I would rather see clear, objective description. Maybe I'm being a pedant on this, but J.S. Kennedy (The New Anthropomorphism, 1993, CUP) was spot on in my view.</italic> </p><p>We have done our best to carefully choose the words we used in this study. In general we tried to avoid any word which indicates that we are measuring food intake using video tracking or the flyPAD method. Although all our data indicate that both methods allow us to extrapolate food intake quite precisely, technically speaking we are not measuring food intake.</p><p>We have modified the text to minimize the use of the words mentioned by Dr. Simpson. We find however, that completely avoiding the use of words such as &quot;decide&quot; and &quot;choose&quot; is detrimental to the readability of the manuscript. Furthermore, these two terms are widely used in many studies describing animal behavior, including studies using invertebrates.

My understanding is that theory and experiment (Levy flight; intrinsic (local) search vs. extrinsic search (ranging); Dethier's fly dance, etc.) predicts that flies should stay nearby &quot;high quality&quot; patches and roam more extensively when on &quot;lower quality&quot; patches. Staying nearby to an imbalanced food source when in a state of AA imbalance and roaming globally when AA balanced appears contrary to expectations and suggests something interesting, perhaps about the evolved predicted spatial distribution of protein resources in the environment, e.g. complementary imbalanced AA sources are likely to be close by to one another. In the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection there is an unconvincing statement on this issue, which needs some more thought I think.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, we think that the point raised by Dr. Simpson stems from a misunderstanding of our experimental design. We recognize that we have to be clearer in our description. The AA+ rich (balanced) and AA+ suboptimal (imbalanced) labels refer to the dietary pre-treatment of the flies 3 days prior to the foraging assay. During the assay, all flies irrespective of their internal state were tested in an arena containing food patches of the same quality (9 food patches with yeast at 180g/L and the other 9 with sucrose at 180g/L). This is important as the experimental design aims at describing the effect of different internal state on foraging in the same environment. Therefore, since we don’t test the behavior of flies around patches of varying qualities, our results don’t contradict the previously reported findings. We therefore consider the statement valid: “Taken together, these changes in exploratory strategy should enable the fly to efficiently increase the intake of yeast while minimizing the distance travelled to the next spot.”</p><p>Because we consider this is a crucial point that should be very clear in our manuscript, we have now modified both the text and the figures to clarify the experimental design and our findings more clearly. Specifically:</p><p>When describing the diets used for the metabolic state manipulations, we added a sentence that clarifies that these diets were given before the assay: “we manipulated the metabolic state of the flies by letting them feed ad libitum on a chemically defined (holidic) medium (Piper et al., 2014) during three days prior to the foraging assay. This holidic medium allows us to specifically manipulate amino acids (AA) in the diet”.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the holidic medium label now says: “Dietary pre-treatment (holidic medium):”</p><p>We changed the text in the last paragraph of the Introduction: &quot;Furthermore, we describe how the internal deficit of dietary amino acids increases exploitation of proteinaceous patches and restricts global exploration and how these behaviors dynamically shift towards increasing exploration as the fly reaches satiation.”</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> we have added the label “Dietary pre-treatment” on top of the text describing the internal state conditions and we have added the labels “Yeast 180 g/L” and “Sucrose 180 g/L” on top of the representative trajectories in panels A, B and C. Furthermore, in all figures containing panels with box plots, we have changed the label referring to the metabolic state from “AA” to “AA pre-treatment”.</p><p>At the beginning of the Results section where we describe the tracking setup, we explain: “To capture how flies decide what food to eat, we built an automated image-based tracking setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that captures the position of a single <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in a foraging arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) containing 9 yeast patches (amino acid source) and 9 sucrose patches (carbohydrate source) of equal concentration.”</p><p>Substrate labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> now read: “Yeast 180g/L” and “Sucrose 180 g/L”.</p><p>We hope that with these changes clarify the experimental design.</p><p><italic>Subsection “ORs mediate efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate food source”. This section could be set up by referencing back to the observation reported earlier that arrival rates at food sources was not impacted by state – implying that olfactory cues acting over a distance are not involved, but close-range chemosensory cues (short-range olfactory and gustatory) are more likely. Would help build the narrative.</italic> </p><p>We thank Dr. Simpson for this suggestion. We had considered using this narrative but decided not to do so given that the encounter rate increases in AA-deprived flies.</p><p><italic>The Discussion is where you need to address the matter mentioned above in the subsection “Amino acid challenges reduce global exploration and increase revisits to the same yeast patch”. The blowfly dance results seem at odds with present findings – flies dance more vigorously and stay longer locally after stimulation with a higher concentration food source. The same is the case for bees and other animals (William Bell's work – e.g. see his 1990 book). It is true that greater levels of deprivation elicit greater local dancing to a given food; but still the effect is strongly dependent on food quality relative to state.</italic> </p><p>We hope that we have clarified this issue in the preceding answer to your earlier comments. As we think that the interpretation is still correct and there is no conflict with previous blowfly dance results we decided not to modify the text in the subsection “Amino acid challenges reduce global exploration and increase revisits to the same yeast patch”.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>Ribeiro's group uses this paper to establish a new assay to assess the relationships between internal state defined by the interaction between sexual experience (mated or virgin) and metabolic experience (more or less amino acids in the medium) on behaviour (explore or exploit). I like the analysis very much and I think it will be a welcome addition to the literature. Their method includes potential to dissect decision making at the level of behavior and offers a world of new possibilities for evaluating the contribution of genes, development, and physiology to behavior. They note and promise that they are providing insight into mechanism as well and this part of the paper pales when compared to the behavioral analysis. The nod to mechanism occurs via the manipulation of Orco to demonstrate a role for smell in the behavioural strategy used by mated females. Not clear that it plays a role for the virgins because there are no data and it seems less likely but entirely possible that olfaction is used to detect or evaluate sugars. I do not think more experiments need to be performed but I think the Orco data provide more of a proof of principle than an exposition of mechanism and the paper would be improved if these data were presented that way. This same point applies to the tyramine β hydroxylase experiments. The paper is written as if these data provide insight into the brain, but there are no experiments to show that brain octopamine as opposed to octopamine in the ventral nerve cord are responsible for the effects. Again, I am not suggesting that this already long manuscript needs more data, only that the nod to mechanism is more of statement of possibility than indication of genetic pathways, anatomic pathways, or neuronal circuits. The paper is more than just a &quot;methods paper&quot; because of the insights provided by this analysis of effects of environment on foraging, reproductive behavior and, potentially, decision making. The readers of eLife will like this one.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the positive assessment of our work and thank the reviewer for the pertinent remarks. We have modified several sections of the manuscript to present the <italic>tyramine β hydroxylase</italic> manipulation results and the <italic>Orco</italic> manipulation results as proof of principle rather than mechanistic insights into neuronal processes (see also answers to major comments of Reviewer #1). In summary:</p><p>In the last paragraph of the Introduction we highlight that the two mutation experiments <italic>are examples</italic> of the potential of our setup to dissect neuronal mechanisms of the behavior under study. We also removed the word “mechanistic” and describe the results from the experiments with the mutants as “initial insights”.</p><p>We introduce the <italic>Orco</italic> manipulation as a proof of principle experiment (subsection “ORs mediate efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate food source”, first paragraph).</p><p>In the octopamine section we added &quot;we therefore decided to show that our setup could be used to test possible neuromodulatory effects of octopamine on yeast foraging&quot; to this sentence to highlight the fact that these experiments are more about exploring the usefulness of the tracking approach than an in depth exploration of molecular mechanisms. And in the conclusion of this section, we highlight that this is just a “first step” in the dissection of the mechanisms.</p><p>In the Discussion to remove any association of our results with specific insights about the brain (second paragraph), we changed the word “brain” by “nervous system” and highlight that it is the accumulated evidence (not just our results) which lead us to conclude that the nervous system might use different mechanisms to change specific aspects of behavioral outcomes.</p><p>Furthermore, we have modified the Abstract to clearly state that the results of the <italic>Orco</italic> manipulation apply only to mated females:</p><p>“Finally, we show that olfaction mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate protein source in mated females”.</p><p>We have also added this clarification in the conclusion of the results of the <italic>Orco</italic> manipulation section:</p><p>“Taken together these results show that, in mated females, OR-mediated olfaction is necessary for efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate resource but is not required to locate food patches at a short range or to achieve nutritional homeostasis.”</p><p>Finally, we have also included the term “mated” in the Discussion: “Our data suggest that while olfactory-impaired matedflies…”</p><p>Regarding the detection of sugars, we are aware that some few studies have suggested that flies can detect sugar at a distance. While this is therefore a possibility we have done our best to minimize that our sucrose patches emit volatiles. We use sucrose with 99.5% purity mixed with ultrapure agarose and milliQ water to prepare our sucrose patch solutions. The sugar patches in our foraging arena should therefore not have any volatiles that can be detected by the flies using olfaction. As the experimental evidences for olfactory detection of sugars at a distance are scarce and we minimize the probability that our sucrose patches emit volatiles we think it is unlikely that flies use olfaction to evaluate sugars. However, as always in science one never knows.</p></body></sub-article></article>
