These rhythms are generated by endogenous molecular clocks that entrain to environmental cycles, predominantly light and temperature, and can maintain rhythms when released into constant conditions (free-run). A conserved mechanistic feature of circadian clocks is an auto-regulatory transcriptional feedback loop in which circadian proteins rhythmically regulate their own expression to generate a clock, and also drive a global program of cycling gene expression. Discovery of this clock mechanism was revolutionary and has received well-deserved recognition, but critical aspects of how the clock is sustained remain unclear.</p><p>PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) are the auto-regulating elements of the circadian clock in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allada and Chung, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hardin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng and Sehgal, 2012</xref>). The expression of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> is driven by circadian transcription factors CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC), and peaks around the early night. Relative to their mRNA peak, accumulation of PER and TIM proteins is delayed byÂ ~6 hr. In the mid-to-late night, PER and TIM are predominantly nuclear, and once in the nucleus, they repress CLK-CYC activity to decrease <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> expression. Degradation of TIM and then of PER in the morning resets the transcription cycle and restarts the loop. In order to maintain rhythmicity and set the proper pace of the circadian clock, both PER and TIM need to be dynamically regulated on multiple levels. For instance, a stable circadian molecular oscillator requires temporal delays to separate the phases of gene transcription and repression and thereby prevent these from reaching equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng and Sehgal, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The overall levels and stability of TIM constitute a critical circadian modality. Although PER is the more important factor for transcriptional regulation, levels and activity of PER depend upon TIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Price et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubruille and Emery, 2008</xref>). TIM levels are acutely modulated by light, which promotes the degradation of TIM, and thereby PER, during the day and allows the rise in circadian transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suri et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang and Sehgal, 2001</xref>). Subsequently, TIM accumulation is necessary to stabilize PER and promote its nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in the presence of light:dark cycles, light delays the accumulation of TIM-PER and so contributes to the lag in repression. These temporal relationships are largely preserved in constant darkness, and are also entrained by temperature cycles regardless of light cues, although the mechanisms under these conditions are not known.</p><p>While regulated protein stability and translation have been directly explored as mechanisms that could contribute to maintenance of the feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dembinska et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1998</xref> ;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim and Allada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and regulation of protein stability is indeed critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng and Sehgal, 2012</xref>), little investigation has focused on a potential role of alternative splicing. To date, the best-studied role for alternative splicing in Drosophila rhythms is in the temperature-dependence of the behavioral siesta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Majercak et al., 2004</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins et al., 2004</xref>). Splicing is driven by spliceosomes, dynamic RNA-protein complexes composed of five core small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U4, U5, U6 snRNP) andÂ &gt;150 additional proteins specific for each snRNP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we report a circadian role for Pre-mRNA Processing factor 4 (PRP4), a conserved component of the spliceosomal U4/U6.U5 triple small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (tri-snRNP) complex. We identified PRP4 in a screen for novel regulators of the free-running circadian period, and established that PRP4 is necessary in <italic>tim+</italic> clock cells to maintain 24 hr period and robust rhythms of the circadian clock. In addition to <italic>prp4,</italic> downregulation of multiple tri-snRNP components affected circadian period length and rhythmicity, which led us to implicate this entire spliceosomal complex in circadian regulation. Using unbiased RNA-Sequencing, we characterized the splicing events regulated by PRP4 and identified a novel intron retention event in <italic>tim.</italic> We show that alternative splicing of this intron in <italic>tim</italic> represents an important mechanism to time the daily accumulation of TIM, in constant darkness following entrainment to light:dark cycles and also in temperature cycles. Together, these findings identify a mechanism contributing to the maintenance of clock function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pre-mRNA splicing factor four is a new regulator of the circadian clock</title><p>In a screen for kinases that affect circadian period length of Drosophila rest:activity rhythms in constant dark:dark (DD) conditions, we identified Pre-mRNA Processing factor 4 (PRP4), a splicing factor that also has kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kojima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>).

Thus, we determined the effect of <italic>prp4</italic> knockdown on fly diurnal activity in LD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Control (<italic>TUG; Dcr2/+</italic>) flies displayed characteristic bimodal activity in LD, with activity peaks that precede the onset of light (ZT0) and the onset of dark (ZT12). Compared to controls, the flies with circadian-cell-specific <italic>prp4</italic> knockdown (<italic>TUG</italic>; <italic>Dcr2Â &gt;prp4<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>(<italic>GD</italic>)) exhibited a delayed evening activity peak as well as a slightly delayed morning peak. These findings are consistent with the longer endogenous period that we report for <italic>prp4</italic> knockdown flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâB</xref>).</p><p>As the small lateral ventral neurons (s-LNvs) are the most relevant clock cells for driving rest:activity rhythms under constant dark conditions, we asked if effects of PRP4 were mediated in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, 1998</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we downregulated <italic>prp4</italic> in both s-LNvs and large lateral ventral neurons (l-LNvs) with <italic>a Gal4</italic> transgene driven by a peptide expressed specifically in these cells, Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF). Knockdown of <italic>prp4</italic> with <italic>pdf-Gal4</italic> driving the weaker RNAi line (GD) led to a modest yet significant lengthening of free-running circadian period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, the knockdown of <italic>prp4</italic> with a stronger RNAi (KK) led to complex rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These complex rhythms were generally characterized by changes in the behavioral pattern, often manifest as phase shifts during day 4 or 5 of constant darkness (seeÂ ~6 hr shift in the record shown), in the midst of an otherwise rhythmic record (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Such a complex rhythm phenotype could reflect uncoupling of period into two components of <italic>pdf</italic>+Â and <italic>pdf-</italic> cell oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that PRP4 action in LNvs contributes to maintaining clock function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PRP4 is required for robust TIM and PER cycling</title><p>Since our data indicated that PRP4 is necessary in LNvs for proper circadian rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we next examined the circadian cycling of PER and TIM in s-LNvs at regular intervals around the clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>). Cycling of both PER and TIM was affected in s-LNvs upon <italic>prp4</italic> knockdown with the clock-specific <italic>TUG</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>). Total TIM levels, as quantified by corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) image analysis, were decreased during the night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâC</xref>). PER levels were also lower in the late night (ZT20), and especially so in the early morning (ZT2), in <italic>prp4</italic> knockdown flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Additionally, nuclear accumulation of PER was delayed beyondÂ ~ZT20, the time point at which PER was already partially localized to the nucleus in control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further characterize the effect on nuclear expression, we profiled relative nuclear PER expression upon <italic>prp4</italic> knockdown with each of the two RNAi lines (GD and KK) in s-LNvs around the time of nuclear accumulation of PER (ZT18-ZT22). We found that the nuclear accumulation of PER was slower in flies with decreased <italic>prp4</italic> (both GD and KK RNAi lines) than in controls (<italic>TUG</italic>; <italic>Dcr2/+</italic>) at these time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, our immunohistochemistry data point to a distinct molecular clock phenotype upon <italic>prp4</italic> downregulation. Because TIM is necessary for nuclear accumulation of PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vosshall et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saez and Young, 1996</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jang et al., 2015</xref>), reduced TIM accumulation could account for the delay and overall reduced nuclear expression of PER in s-LNvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which together could account for the longer free-running period.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39821.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PRP4 is required for robust TIM and PER cycling.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Cycling of PER and TIM is disrupted in s-LNvs of <italic>prp4</italic> knockdown flies.

The pan-neuronal manipulation targeted <italic>prp4</italic> more broadly, allowing us to verify the efficiency of the knockdown through RNA analysis of whole heads. We consistently observedÂ ~50% reduction in <italic>prp4</italic> RNA in head lysates of flies where it was knocked down pan-neuronally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

The results obtained with this relatively crude method agreed well with our immunohistochemistry profiling of s-LNvs. First, we observed a strong effect of <italic>prp4</italic> downregulation on total TIM levels, particularly during the initial TIM accumulation phase (ZT10-18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâE</xref>). Quantification of our western blot data across multiple experiments suggested that <italic>prp4</italic> knockdown also blunted the circadian cycling of TIM protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). While the total levels of PER were not changed upon <italic>prp4</italic> downregulation, its phosphorylation profile was dampened. In control (<italic>elavGal4; Dcr2/+</italic>) flies, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edery et al., 1994</xref>), PER was increasingly phosphorylated in the late night and early morning up until its degradation. In flies with reduced <italic>prp4</italic> levels, PER migrated at a lower molecular weight on western blots (ZT18-ZT2). We speculate that the dampened phosphorylation profile of PER reflects, at least in part, the defect in nuclear accumulation of PER because a number of sites on PER get phosphorylated only when PER starts to accumulate in the nucleus (after ZT20) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiu et al., 2011</xref>).

Overexpression of â<italic>tim</italic>-splicedâ and â<italic>tim</italic>-retainedâ cDNAs caused lengthening of free-running periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

We hypothesized that differential splicing of <italic>tim-tiny</italic> is necessary for the maintenance of circadian rhythmicity and so the â<italic>tim</italic>-retainedâ construct would rescue the behavioral rhythm most efficiently because it allows for both the splicing and retention of the intron. Additionally, because <italic>prp4</italic> knockdown increases the retention of <italic>tim-tiny</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and prolongs the rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we speculated that the â<italic>tim</italic>-splicedâ construct would rescue with a shorter period than the â<italic>tim</italic>-retainedâ construct. As expected, the expression of <italic>tim</italic> cDNA with a 5â splice site mutation in <italic>tim-tiny</italic> (â<italic>tim-</italic>retainedÂ +Â ssMâ) did not restore rhythms in <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Importantly, there was a significant difference in period length between the flies that were rhythmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Importantly, our findings contribute to the understanding of a longstanding question in the circadian field, specifically how negative feedback by clock proteins is delayed in order to permit distinct phases, and therefore oscillations, of transcriptional activation and repression. In Drosophila, PER translation does not appear to be delayed relative to its mRNA production in a daily cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1998</xref>), but the protein is initially destabilized through its phosphorylation by the DOUBLETIME (DBT) kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Price et al., 1998</xref>). TIM stabilizes PER by alleviating this effect of DBT, and so accumulation of TIM, which only occurs after dark as TIM is degraded by light, determines the rise of PER. How this mechanism persists when light is not a cycling cue, for instance in constant darkness or in temperature cycles in constant light, was not known. Alternative splicing of the <italic>tim-tiny</italic> intron may be critical under these conditions.</p><p>The circadian profile of <italic>tim-tiny</italic> intron retention (i.e. high during the daytime) is consistent with it delaying the accumulation of TIM protein. Indeed, this mechanism is particularly robust in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and also in temperature cycles in constant light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoshii et al., 2005</xref>). The retention of <italic>tim-tiny</italic> peaks at high temperatures, which correlates with low TIM levels (Glaser, F.T., and Stanewsky, R., 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoshii et al., 2005</xref>). We propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) whereby the splice choice at the <italic>tim-tiny</italic> locus modulates the rate of TIM accumulation, which in turn affects the total levels of nuclear PER and TIM. The intron retention of <italic>tim-tiny</italic>, therefore, likely contributes to a delay between initial <italic>tim</italic> expression and accumulation of TIM, ensuring stability and robustness of the circadian oscillator. At the same time, the response of this splicing event to temperature promotes flexibility of the clock.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39821.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Alternative splicing of the <italic>tim</italic>-tiny intron promotes oscillations of TIM levels.</title><p>The model depicts how retention of the <italic>tim-tiny</italic> intron, which is increased upon downregulation of <italic>prp4,</italic> regulates TIM cycling.Â Both the circadian clock (<bold>A</bold>) and temperature cycles (<bold>B</bold>) regulate retention of the <italic>tim-tiny</italic> intron.

Temperature cycles can maintain clock function under constant light conditions (LL), which would otherwise disrupt the clock.

However, studies from a range of organisms increasingly point to the involvement of the core spliceosomal machinery not only in AS execution but also in splice junction selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burckin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pleiss et al., 2007</xref>). Our RNA-seq findings further support the idea that the abundance/stability of at least some components of the core spliceosome has an effect on a select subset of AS events, while constitutive splicing seems to be unperturbed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). A functional network of spliceosomal proteins has been proposed on the basis of their knockdown phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Papasaikas et al., 2015</xref>). According to this model, PRP4 resides within the tri-snRNP regulatory module, which largely coincides with the previously reported physical interactions between the components of the tri-snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dellaire et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bottner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings of similar circadian behavioral effects caused by loss of any of several tri-snRNP components strongly implicate the tri-snRNP complex in circadian regulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). It remains to be established how the decreased abundance of tri-snRNP components triggers changes in alternative splicing. We hypothesize that tri-snRNP level/activity is limiting for a subset of AS reactions, likely the ones with weaker splice sites. This hypothesis is supported by two recent studies reporting that (1) <italic>Prp4</italic> in fission yeast is necessary to recognize and splice the introns with weak splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eckert et al., 2016</xref>) and (2) decreased availability of mammalian <italic>Prpf8</italic> leads to the selective retention of introns that harbor weak 5â splice sites (Wickramasinghe, V.O., et al., 2015).</p><p>We speculate that tri-snRNP components constitute a well-conserved regulatory module for circadian clocks. Conservation of the circadian role of tri-snRNP is suggested by several findings. First, the human homolog of PRP4 was identified as a hit in a genome-wide RNAi screen for regulators of the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Secondly, SM-like (LSM) proteins that are associated with U6 snRNP were recently shown to regulate circadian rhythmicity in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and in mammalian cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perez-SantÃ¡ngelo et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, some tri-snRNP components (Prpf8, Prpf31 and SART1) physically associate with mammalian PER2 complexes, further highlighting potential cross-talk between central clock components and the tri-snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although AS has been implicated in the regulation of circadian clocks, it has not been linked to clock function in the manner we report here. In <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, the ratio of alternatively spliced <italic>frequency (frq)</italic> isoforms determines the robustness of circadian rhythmicity and fine-tunes the period length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garceau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 1997</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, AS regulates the circadian clock by multiple mechanisms, such as the production of new isoforms that competitively inhibit functional clock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seo et al., 2012</xref>) and the modulation of clock RNA levels via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the alternative splicing regulator SR-related matrix protein of 160 kDa (SRm160) modulates PER levels locally in the pacemaker neurons to regulate circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beckwith et al., 2017</xref>). The key theme that emerges from these studies is that AS acts directly on core clock components to set their levels. Alternatively, splicing mechanisms could regulate diurnal rhythmicity of neuronal excitability, as proposed for splicing of BK channels in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shelley et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our study identifies a novel splicing event in <italic>tim</italic> that can regulate TIM levels in both cell culture and in flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). How does the splicing affect TIM levels? It is unlikely that the retention of <italic>tim-tiny</italic> leads to NMD-mediated RNA decrease because the flies with <italic>prp4</italic> downregulated do not have reduced <italic>tim</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). On the contrary, overall <italic>tim</italic> RNA levels tend to be increased in those flies. Additionally, expression of <italic>tim</italic> cDNA constructs with constitutively retained <italic>tim-tiny</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) decreases TIM levels without altering <italic>tim</italic> mRNA levels (data not shown). Therefore, we suggest that it is either the <italic>tim</italic> mRNA translation step or the stability of the truncated TIM isoform, TIM<sup>tiny</sup>, produced by <italic>tim-tiny</italic> that is sub-optimal. The 267 amino acids at the C-terminus of TIM that are predicted to be lost in TIM<sup>tiny</sup> include a putative cytoplasmic localization signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saez et al., 2011</xref>) as well as a predicted threonine phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodenmiller et al., 2007</xref>), both of which could significantly change stability and function of TIM. Notably, TIM<sup>tiny</sup> is typically not detected in western blots of TIM expression in flies, so it appears that <italic>tim-tiny</italic> retention serves only to reduce the amount of <italic>tim</italic> RNA that can effectively produce protein.</p><p>While studying the effect of <italic>tim-tiny</italic> retention in isolation can give us a quick snapshot of its importance, overall splicing of <italic>tim</italic> is considerably more complex. In parallel to <italic>tim-tiny</italic>, in this study we examined the splicing profile of a previously reported <italic>tim-cold</italic> intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boothroyd et al., 2007</xref>). Cycles of <italic>tim-tiny</italic> and <italic>tim-cold</italic> intron retention are similar under light:dark and constant dark conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), but temperature cycles have different effects on the splicing of these two introns. <italic>tim-tiny</italic> intron retention increases with hot temperature, whereas <italic>tim-cold</italic> intron retention increases at the onset of the cold cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Also, <italic>tim-cold</italic> retention does not cycle in temperature cycles in LL, suggesting that it does not contribute to rhythmicity under these conditions. <italic>tim-tiny</italic> intron is upstream of <italic>tim-cold</italic>, which means that <italic>tim-tiny</italic> retention should lead to TIM downregulation regardless of the splicing decision at the <italic>tim-cold</italic> locus. Following differential splicing at <italic>tim-tiny</italic> locus, <italic>tim-cold</italic> could get either retained or spliced, introducing an additional regulatory layer. The interplay of AS at the level of these two introns can produce a range of TIM isoforms, the roles of which remain to be elucidated, particularly with respect to temperature entrainment.</p><p>In Drosophila, splicing of <italic>D. melanogaster per</italic> intron 8 (<italic>dmip8</italic>), the intron located in the 3â untranslated region (UTR) of <italic>per</italic>, is regulated by both light and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Majercak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>). This splicing mechanism allows flies to delay their evening behavior during long photoperiods and/or high temperatures, and might play a role in seasonal adaptation.

While these RNA-Seq findings have not been verified through other approaches, they lead us to hypothesize that diurnal oscillations in tri-snRNP components drive circadian splicing of <italic>tim</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and potentially other circadian output genes locally in specific clock neurons. This hypothesis is further strengthened by another recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) that suggests heterogeneous alternative splicing profiles for different circadian neuronal groups. In addition to changes in total levels of PRP4, circadian regulation of its kinase activity could contribute to differential splicing of <italic>tim</italic> over the course of the day. We establish a role for PRP4 in LNvs, the key pacemaker cluster necessary for the maintenance of circadian cycles under constant dark conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, based on our findings that splicing of <italic>tim</italic> is regulated by temperature and persists in constant light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we speculate that PRP4 also functions in DN1s, clock cells implicated in temperature sensing and entrainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yadlapalli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). In summary, while much of the focus in the circadian field has been on transcriptional or post-translational control, our findings indicate a critical role for alternative splicing, perhaps in a cell-type-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

After a 30 min wash in 1xPBST at RT, brains were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in 5% DS at RT. Secondary antibodies were used at 1:500 dilution and included FITC donkey-anti-guinea pig (Rockland), Alexa555 donkey-anti-rabbit (Jackson Immuno), Alexa647 donkey-anti-mouse (Jackson Immuno). Samples were washed for 30 min in 1xPBST at RT, and mounted in VectaShield. Slides were imaged with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a 40x oil-immersion objective and a 0.5 Î¼M step size. The signal was adjusted to be not saturated as determined by QLUT parameters. After this original adjustment, all the settings were kept constant for a given experimental set. ImageJ software was used for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Western blot assays with fly heads were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garbe et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, 7â10 fly heads per genotype/condition were lysed in 1x Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. For S2 cell extracts, 48 hr after transfection, cells were collected and lysed in the same buffer as described for fly heads. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-PER (UP1140, 1:1000), anti-TIM (UPR42, 1:1000) and anti-HSP70 (Sigma, 1:5000).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Plasmids and S2 cell culture</title><p>For cell culture expression, <italic>tim</italic> cDNA was subcloned into pIZ-V5 plasmids.

Mutagenesis of the 5â splice donor of <italic>tim-tiny</italic> intron site was performed with primers catalogued in the Key resources table using Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB).</p><p>S2 cells were cultured in a standard Schneider medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma).

Fly heads were then collected on dry ice and homogenized with TRIzol (ThermoFischer) on ice using standard protocols. Following the phase separation, the aqueous phase was transferred into a new tube, mixed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and loaded directly onto the RNeasy mini kit columns (Qiagen). The rest of the RNA isolation was done according to the manufacturerâs protocol. On-column DNase digestion (Qiagen) for 15 min at RT was always included. cDNA was generated with Superscript II (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR reaction was performed in a ViiA7 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with gene specific primers. Relative gene expression was calculated using the ÎÎCt method with <italic>rp49</italic> as normalization control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA-Sequencing and data analysis</title><p>RNA extraction was performed as described in the âQuantitative RT-PCRâ section above. Tapestation (Agilent) was used to ensure that all of RNA samples were of high-quality (RINÂ &gt;8). five samples per each genotype were selected and prepared with Lexogenâs SENSE mRNA-Seq library Prep Kit. Illumina Next-Generation Sequencing (NextSeq 500) with 300pb paired-end high output run (atÂ ~50M reads per sample) was performed by the Genomics Facility at the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA.</p><p>The RNA-seq reads were aligned to the Drosophila genome (dm6.BDGP6.v88) using STAR version 2.5.3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Normalization and quantification were performed with the PORT version 0.8.2a-beta pipelineÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant, 2018</xref>) which first removes reads that map to ribosomal RNA sequences or mitochondrial DNA and then uses a read re-sampling strategy for normalization to minimize unwanted variance such as differences in sequencing depth among the samples. PORT normalization was performed before quantification, at the aligned read level. After normalization, the quantification of features (genes, exons, introns, junctions) was done with respect to the Ensemblv88 annotation. The differential expression analysis was performed using the R Bioconductor package limma-voom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). General pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>). The top 743 differentially expressed genes upon <italic>prp4</italic> downregulation, corresponding to FDRÂ â¤Â 0.05, were used for pathway enrichment analysis. Differential splicing analysis for <italic>prp4</italic> knockdown samples (with respect to the control) was performed using CASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Full transcript quantification was done using Cufflinks-2.2, and differential psi (percent spliced in) analysis was performed for various gene isoforms to identify alternate splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trapnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical parameters are included in the legends of each figure.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: John Ewer (Reviewer #1). The other reviewers remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>As described in the authors' Abstract: &quot;Transcription-translation feedback loops that comprise eukaryotic circadian clocks rely upon temporal delays that separate the phase of active transcription of clock genes, such as <italic>Drosophila period (per)</italic> and <italic>timeless (tim),</italic> from negative feedback by the two proteins. However, mechanisms underlying such delays are unclear. Through an RNA interference screen, [the authors] found that pre-mRNA processing 4 (PRP4) kinase, a component of the U4/U5.U6 triple small nuclear ribonucleoprotein(tri-snRNP) spliceosome, and other tri-snRNP components regulate cycling of the molecular clock as well as rest:activity rhythms. Unbiased RNA-Sequencing uncovered an alternatively spliced intron in <italic>tim</italic> whose increased retention upon <italic>prp4</italic> downregulation leads to decreased TIM levels. [They] demonstrate that the splicing of <italic>tim</italic> is rhythmic with a phase that parallels delayed accumulation of the protein in a 24-hour cycle. [The authors] propose that alternative splicing [(in addition to regulation of protein translation)] constitutes an important clock mechanism for delaying the daily accumulation of clock proteins, and thereby negative feedback by them.&quot;</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>Please respond to all of the major comments from all three reviewers since they raise specific items that should be addressed. As pointed out by Reviewer 3, &quot;the major unresolved conceptual issue is how the differential splicing of this intron is produced throughout the day by the clock. The authors speculate that daily changes in the level of splicing factors (and there is some evidence for this in earlier tissue-specific RNA profiling analyses) might produce the altered intron inclusion. Since <italic>prp4</italic> is a kinase, there might also be circadian regulation of its kinase activity. This possibility could be mentioned in the discussion.â The minor comments from Reviewer 3 should also be addressed.</p><p>As suggested by Reviewer 2, the title does not say much about the mechanism. The authors should consider the title suggested by Reviewer 2: &quot;Spliceosome Factors Target timeless mRNA to control protein accumulation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian oscillator.&quot;</p><p>The original reviewersâ comments are appended below.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that shows that the regulation of the spliceosome itself contributes to the mechanisms that set the periodicity of the circadian clock. It nicely extends recent findings by Wang et al., 2018 (10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.35618) by identifying an intron in the timeless gene whose retention, due to actions mediated by components of the U4/U5.U6 spliceosome, (likely) delays the accumulation of TIM protein, thereby affecting the exact periodicity of the clock.</p><p>I am no expert in RNAseq analyses, so can't weigh in on this issue. The rest of the work is solid and well documented, and the conclusions are warranted. Some of the effects are quite modest, but then again, the effects on the clock, while biologically very significant, are &quot;numerically&quot; also modest (in few areas of biology is a change from ~24 to ~26 very impressive).</p><p>My only comments refer to the text.</p><p>1) Abstract &quot;However, mechanisms underlying such delays are unclear.&quot; I would say that the mechanisms are not &quot;unclear&quot; but that &quot;our understanding of the mechanisms involved is incomplete&quot; since there is clear evidence (mentioned in the manuscript, for instance, in the Introduction final paragraph) that phosphorylation, protein stability, and dimerization of PER and TIM, all contribute to the functioning and period-setting of the clock.</p><p>2) Results section: &quot;Overall, these findings strongly suggest that the free-running circadian component of the <italic>prp4</italic>-knockdown phenotype maps to LNvs.&quot; Rather than &quot;maps&quot; I would say, &quot;the function of <italic>prp4</italic> in LNvs contributes to setting the periodicity of the clock&quot;. This because the knocking down <italic>prp4</italic> in all clock neurons (Figures 1A, B) is not quite the same as knocking it down only in LNvs (Figures 1D-G).</p><p>3) Discussion section: &quot;Importantly, our findings address a longstanding question in the circadian field, specifically how negative feedback by clock proteins is delayed in order to permit distinct phases, and therefore oscillations, of transcriptional activation and repression.&quot; Rather than &quot;address&quot; I would say, &quot;contribute to our understanding of&quot;.</p><p>4) In the Introduction and Discussion I think it is appropriate to cite the work of Beckwith et al., 2017 (10.1534/genetics.117.300139), which shows that alternative-splicing regulator, SR-related matrix protein of 160 kDa (SRm160), affects gene expression in pacemaker neurons.</p><p>5) In the Discussion I think it is worth mentioning another situation where a specific alternative splicing event has an impact on clock function, namely the BK potassium channel, where inclusion of a specific exon changes the electrophysiological properties of the channel, most likely contributing to the circadian changes in firing rate of SCN (work from Andrea Meredith's lab).</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Difficult to resist suggesting that rather than &quot;<italic>tim-tiny</italic>&quot;, this intron be called &quot;Tiny tim&quot;â¦.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>The most relevant data (RNA-Seq data) have been made available (Gene Expression Omnibus standard repository, accession # GSE115163).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting study by the Sehgal lab that reveals a new mechanism regulating TIM protein accumulation by producing a truncated unstable TIM protein during daytime. This is a new post-transcriptional mechanism that sheds light on the most obscure part of the negative feedback loop: how is PER/TIM protein accumulation delayed in comparison to the mRNA oscillation. The study represents a lot of smart work, the experiments are clearly presented and it is relatively easy to follow the paper. The data look really convincing although I will have a couple of suggestions.</p><p>â Results section and Figure 1: complex behavioral rhythms are obtained when <italic>prp4</italic> is downregulated in PDF cells whereas long period rhythms are obtained with all-clock neurons downregulation (Figure 1). To me, it suggests that <italic>prp4</italic> downregulation has also effects in pdf- oscillators, which is no surprise. I would not simply conclude that the <italic>prp4</italic>-knockdown phenotype maps to LNvs.</p><p>â Subsection âPRP4 is required for robust TIM and PER cyclingâ and Figure 2: the PER phosphorylation phenotype is strong (Figure 2D). The authors propose that it is a consequence of a defect in PER nuclear transfer, due to TIM decrease. I think that the possibility of a direct effect of <italic>prp4</italic> on PER should be tested by comparing PER phosphorylation in <italic>prp4</italic>+ and <italic>prp4</italic> RNAi flies with a <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> genetic background. I acknowledge that it might not be easy to see since TIM affects PER phosphorylation, but I believe that it is an important point to clarify.</p><p>Would it be possible to analyze the effects of a similar decrease of TIM (50% decrease at ZT18-20 based on Figure 2E) but as a consequence of another molecular defect, on PER phosphorylation?</p><p>â Subsection âPRP4 regulates <italic>tim</italic> splicingâ: It is unclear to me how the 45 genes exhibiting differential splicing (Supplementary file 4, which I could not find) compare to the 5 genes that are described in Figure 3A. Is it the different analysis method? Please clarify.</p><p>â Subsection âPRP4 regulates tim splicingâ third paragraph and Figure 3 (+ Figure 4âfigure supplement 2): I understand that <italic>tim-tiny</italic> mRNA is increased by two-fold in <italic>prp4</italic> RNAi flies (Figure 3D). However, I suppose that the relative quantity of tim-tiny mRNA in comparison to total <italic>tim</italic> mRNA is a key parameter when it comes to explaining the effects of splicing regulation on total TIM protein levels. Please clearly indicate in the text what fraction of total <italic>tim</italic> mRNA <italic>tim-tiny</italic> represents in wild type flies.</p><p>It seems to me the effects of the different <italic>tim</italic> cDNAs on TIM protein levels (S2 cells and transgenic flies in Figure 4) are difficult to extrapolate to wild type and <italic>prp4</italic> RNAi flies if this ratio is not known. Does Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B indicate that the spliced and retained forms are present in similar amounts?</p><p>Figure 5 and 6: I understand that the <italic>tim-tiny/tim</italic> ratio is indeed close to 1 in average. If I understand this well, that would say that half of <italic>tim</italic> transcripts do not produce a functional TIM protein. I believe that this point should be emphasized in the paper even before telling about the cycling of this ratio.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>â The title does not tell much about the mechanism and I would suggest to make it more specific. For example, something in this line: Spliceosome Factors Target timeless mRNA to control protein accumulation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian oscillator</p><p>â Zheng and Sehgal, 2012 (Introduction section) does not seem to be in the list of references</p><p>â Figure 2 legend: E is quantification from D rather than A?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes a well done investigation of broad interest to the circadian rhythm field because it demonstrates a novel clock-controlled splicing event in the RNA of a circadian clock gene (timeless, or <italic>tim</italic>) and makes a compelling argument that this splicing event introduces a delay in the accumulation of full length TIM protein. Such a delay has been postulated to be essential for the generation of oscillating expression for circadian proteins like PERIOD (PER) and TIM, but the delay has been proposed to arise from post-translational regulation of protein phosphorylation and stability (The post-translational effects are not disputed here; splicing is an additional regulatory step). Early circadian regulation of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> splicing has been shown to be needed for photoperiodic and temperature input pathways to the clock, but not for the underlying oscillation itself. Therefore, this manuscript will be of general interest. It is a very complete effort, with support for the role of RNA splicing coming from alterations to free-running period, rhythmicity and PER/TIM expression from knock-down of several splicing factors, identification in RNA-seq studies of a <italic>tim</italic> intron that is preferentially maintained with knock-down of one of these splicing factors (<italic>prp4</italic>), demonstration of altered effects on the oscillator with expression of mRNAs specific for the different alternative splice products, and demonstration of enhanced splicing for inclusion of the intron during the middle of the day or with higher temperatures, under conditions when it could delay the accumulation of TIM protein. The enhanced splicing event is particularly prominent in DD and may comprise a specific mechanism to confer phase delays of TIM accumulation in DD.</p><p>The major unresolved conceptual issue is how the differential splicing of this intron is produced throughout the day by the clock. The authors speculate that daily changes in the level of splicing factors (and there is some evidence for this in earlier tissue-specific RNA profiling analyses) might produce the altered intron inclusion. Since <italic>prp4</italic> is a kinase, there might also be circadian regulation of its kinase activity. This possibility could be mentioned in the Discussion.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) Two lines on Table 1 are both labeled TUG&gt;Dcr2;<italic>prp4</italic> RNAi (GD), but one of these (probably the second one) should perhaps be labeled KK instead of GD. Do these lines target different regions of the <italic>prp4</italic> mRNA to show the effects are target specific? And why does the &quot;stronger&quot; KK line have less effect on period length and rhythmicity than the GD line (Figure 1F and G)?</p><p>2) Define the differences between the boxes and error bars on Figure 1.</p><p>3) While the text states that the morning peak of activity is triggered by lights in Figure 1C, there still seems to be some anticipation â just less than in the control.</p><p>4) The complex rhythm in Figure 1D seems to include an ~6hr phase shift at the end of the record. Please comment on this in the text. The figure legend indicates that these rhythms are double-plotted but they appear to be single-plotted.</p><p>5) Why are the intervals for the collection of samples for TIM analysis in figure 2E 2hr long while they are precise times for PER analysis?</p><p>6) There does not seem to be a Supplementary file 3 nor a Supplementary file 4.</p><p>7) The model presented in Figure 6 argues that the delayed accumulation of TIM during the day due to inclusion of the extra intron (which truncates the reading frame of the protein) introduces a phase delay into the clock. But overexpression of cDNA with this intron missing produces longer periods, which apriori is inconsistent with the model (it should speed the clock, not slow it). Presumably the overexpression is producing some additional effects like prolonged repression of the E box, outside the confines of the model. Some discussion of this point is needed.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>Supplementary files 3 and 4 are missing and are important. They need to be provided. The statistical analysis is fine.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39821.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] My only comments refer to the text.</p><p>1) Abstract &quot;However, mechanisms underlying such delays are unclear.&quot; I would say that the mechanisms are not &quot;unclear&quot; but that &quot;our understanding of the mechanisms involved is incomplete&quot; since there is clear evidence (mentioned in the manuscript, for instance, in the Introduction final paragraph) that phosphorylation, protein stability, and dimerization of PER and TIM, all contribute to the functioning and period-setting of the clock.</p><p>2) Results section: &quot;Overall, these findings strongly suggest that the free-running circadian component of the prp4-knockdown phenotype maps to LNvs.&quot; Rather than &quot;maps&quot; I would say, &quot;the function of prp4 in LNvs contributes to setting the periodicity of the clock&quot;.

We revisited our Cufflinks-2.2 analysis of the RNA-Seq data to better calculate this ratio (provided in the new Supplementary File 5). This analysis indicated that the isoforms that retain <italic>tim-tiny</italic> are twofold more abundant than isoforms that do not contain it (at ZT 8 when all of the RNA-Seq samples were collected). This finding would imply that at ZT8 the majority of <italic>tim</italic> isoforms do not produce full-sized TIM or produce unproductive protein that is rapidly degraded (Figure 5). As our data indicate, the ratio of spliced and unspliced forms changes over time (Figure 6A-B). The new information about the ratio is included in the following sentence: âTo estimate how common <italic>tim-tiny</italic> retention was in control flies (<italic>GMR/+)</italic>, we quantified the ratio of isoforms that contain <italic>tim-tiny (tim</italic>-RM and <italic>tim</italic>-RS) to those that do not contain this intron using our Cufflinks-2.2 output (Supplementary File 4).

But overexpression of cDNA with this intron missing produces longer periods, which apriori is inconsistent with the model (it should speed the clock, not slow it). Presumably the overexpression is producing some additional effects like prolonged repression of the E box, outside the confines of the model. Some discussion of this point is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Overexpression of <italic>tim</italic> cDNA from the UAS promoter typically results in longer periods as it does not allow for feedback and so leads to massive accumulation of TIM (Yang and Sehgal, 2001). Please note that earlier studies showing period-shortening with PER over-expression used constructs that included a <italic>per</italic> promoter that could be repressed by feedback (discussed in Yang and Sehgal, 2001). It is true that we do not see a period difference with â<italic>tim-</italic>retainedâ and â<italic>tim-</italic>splicedâ overexpression constructs (Figure 5D), which may be because these constructs have small effects in a wild type background. However, the reviewer is absolutely correct in that the âintron missingâ form should produce shorter periods than the â<italic>tim-</italic>retainedâ form, and we now show the data for expression of these constructs in a <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> background (included as Figure 5E-F; also shown below). Note that both forms rescue with a longer period, as expected of UAS constructs, but rescue with the spliced form (â<italic>tim-</italic>splicedâ) yields a shorter period, albeit in a smaller percentage of flies. The latter point of lower rhythmicity also supports our idea that delays are required for a robust oscillator.</p><p>We added the following sentences to the legend of Figure 5: â(E) <italic>TUG</italic>-driven expression of <italic>tim</italic> cDNA, with both â<italic>tim</italic>-splicedâ and â<italic>tim</italic>-retainedâ constructs, rescues <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> circadian rhythmicity. n.s., not significant at the 0.05 level, **p â¤ 0.01, ****p â¤ 0.0001 by pairwise Fischerâs exact test (n=28-41).

We hypothesized that splicing of <italic>tim-tiny</italic> is necessary for the maintenance of circadian rhythmicity and so the â<italic>tim</italic>-retainedâ construct would rescue the behavioral rhythmicity most efficiently because it allows for both the splicing and retention of the intron. Additionally, because <italic>prp4</italic> knockdown increases the retention of <italic>tim-tiny</italic> (Figure 4) and prolongs the rhythm (Figure 1), we speculated that the â<italic>tim</italic>-splicedâ construct would rescue with a shorter period than the â<italic>tim</italic>-retainedâ construct. As expected, the expression of <italic>tim</italic> cDNA with a 5â splice site mutation in <italic>tim-tiny</italic> (â<italic>tim-</italic>retained+ssMâ) did not restore rhythms in <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> flies (Figure 5E). The other two cDNA constructs, â<italic>tim</italic>-retainedâ and â<italic>tim</italic>-splicedâ rescued the rhythmicity in 54% and 32% of <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> flies, respectively. Importantly, there was a significant difference in period length between the flies that were rhythmic (Figure 5F). As discussed above, the UAS-GAL4 system typically over-expresses proteins and so rescues <italic>per/tim</italic> mutants with longer periods (Yang and Sehgal, 2001), which we observed for the â<italic>tim</italic>-retainedâ isoform (~26 hours). Shorter periods were seen with the â<italic>tim</italic>-splicedâ version (Figure 5F), supporting the idea that <italic>tim-tiny</italic> retention promotes clock delays.â</p><p>We changed the title of Figure 5 to âIntron retention in <italic>tim</italic> decreases TIM levels and affects circadian behaviorâ to better convey the message of the new panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>Supplementary files 3 and 4 are missing and are important.
