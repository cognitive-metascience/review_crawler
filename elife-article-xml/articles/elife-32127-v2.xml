damage repair, metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and aging. Loss of <italic>Sirt6</italic> in mice results in accelerated aging and premature death within a month. Here, we show that haploinsufficiency (<italic>i.e.</italic>, heterozygous deletion) of <italic>Trp53</italic> dramatically extends the lifespan of both female and male <italic>Sirt6</italic>-deficient mice. Haploinsufficiency of <italic>Trp53</italic> in <italic>Sirt6</italic>-deficient mice rescues several age-related phenotypes of Sirt6-deficient mice, including reduced body size and weight, lordokyphosis, colitis, premature senescence, apoptosis, and bone marrow stem cell decline. Mechanistically, SIRT6 deacetylates p53 at lysine 381 to negatively regulate the stability and activity of p53. These findings establish that elevated p53 activity contributes significantly to accelerated aging in Sirt6-deficient mice. Our study demonstrates that p53 is a substrate of SIRT6, and highlights the importance of SIRT6-p53 axis in the regulation of aging.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32127.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Almost without exception, mammals age as they grow older. Older mammals are at greater risk of diseases like cancer, and have fewer stem cells that would otherwise help to keep their organs healthy. Some of the proteins that regulate and impact upon aging have been identified. One of these is an enzyme called SIRT6, which is thought to promote longevity. Mice without any SIRT6 suffer from severe premature aging, and rather than living up to two years like normal mice, SIRT6-deficient mice die within one month of their birth. The mutant mice also lose stem cells and exhibit signs of organ degeneration and body wasting.</p><p>Another protein called p53 is well known for having the opposite effect to SIRT6: it accelerates aging and helps to prevent tumor growth. However, it was unclear if p53 is also involved in the processes that lead to the premature death of mice without SIRT6.</p><p>Now, Ghosh et al. report that mouse cells and tissues without SIRT6 have more p53 compared to control samples. Biochemical experiments showed that the SIRT6 and p53 proteins physically interact, and that SIRT6 could use its enzymatic activity to remove a chemical modification, called acetylation, from p53. Without this specific acetylation, p53 became less stable and its levels dropped. Consequently, p53 was stabilized in the SIRT6-deficient cells. When Ghosh et al. deleted one copy of the gene that codes for p53 in SIRT6-deficient mice, mutant mice that had before only lived for a month now lived for up to sixteen months. Additionally, the mice were healthier, showing fewer signs of aging: for example, they had more immune cells and stem cells, straighter spines, and showed less gut inflammation and less body wasting.</p><p>These findings suggest that SIRT6 does indeed inhibit p53 to counteract the normal aging process. Future experiments may explore if this regulation also holds true in human cells. Detailed knowledge of these molecular interactions could also open up more research into therapies against cancer and aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SIRT6</kwd><kwd>Trp53</kwd><kwd>lifespan extention</kwd><kwd>acetylation</kwd><kwd>premature aging</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17123816; HKU2/CRF/13G</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hao</surname><given-names>Quan</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Zhongjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81671399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xinguang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81330009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Zhongjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005847</institution-id><institution>Health and Medical Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>03142456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Zhongjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dramatic extension of lifespan in Sirt6-deficient mice by <italic>Trp53</italic> haploinsufficiency suggests that SIRT6 has distinct biological function from SIRT1 in regulating p53 activity and preventing cells from senescence/apoptosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian sirtuin 6 (Sirt6), a conserved NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacylase and mono-ADP ribosylase, has been implicated in a range of regulatory pathways involved in premature aging and other age-associated pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kugel and Mostoslavsky, 2014</xref>).

Additionally, the ectopic expression of Sirt6 has been shown to extend the lifespan of male mice by 15% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanfi et al., 2012</xref>). Sirt6 was first identified to deacetylate histone H3 at lysine 9 and 56 (in a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent manner) at the telomeres, promoter regions of target genes and globally as well, to mediate DNA damage repair, maintain telomeric metabolism, suppress NF-κB pathway in promoting longevity and regulate cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawahara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Michishita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michishita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). The intricate roles of Sirt6 in DNA damage repair and metabolic regulation have been reported to stem from its inherent NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylating activity on histones, CtIP, GCN5 and others, apart from its NAD+-dependent mono-ADP ribosylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dominy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaidi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). These and other foundational studies have established the importance of Sirt6 in the regulation of processes contributing to aging and longevity. Although Sirt6-mediated regulation has been reported for several signaling pathways (for example, NF-κB, AKT, and IGF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanfi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawahara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>), the key mechanism underlying the severe acceleration of aging and premature death in Sirt6-deficient mice remains elusive.</p><p><italic>Trp53</italic>, also denoted as <italic>p53</italic>, is a tumor suppressor gene that triggers cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and/or senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rufini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>). p53 has been widely implicated in premature senescence and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hinkal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poyurovsky and Prives, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Varela et al., 2005</xref>). p53 was the first non-histone protein identified to undergo acetylation as a post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gu and Roeder, 1997</xref>). Ever since, a range of lysine residues have been identified across the domains of p53, with majority of acetylated lysine residues being concentrated in the C-terminus region of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks and Gu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gu and Zhu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gu and Roeder, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kruse and Gu, 2009</xref>). Lysine 382, localized in the C-terminus of p53, is identified to undergo marked acetylation followed by lysine 381 and 373 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gu and Roeder, 1997</xref>). Given the stunted half-life of around 30 min for p53, these acetylations have been reported to impart stability to p53, which then mediates a range of downstream functions in response to DNA damage, oncogenic stress, age-associated abnormalities, tumor suppression and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donehower, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lozano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In laminopathy-based progeria, mutant lamin A results in elevated p53 signaling and reducing p53 level significantly ameliorates premature aging phenotypes and extends lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Varela et al., 2005</xref>), thus suggesting that activation of p53-dependent downstream signaling accelerates aging. Interestingly, lamin A is an endogenous activator of SIRT6 and mutant lamin A results in compromised SIRT6 deacetylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghosh et al., 2015</xref>). Given that functional defects in Sirt6 and activation of p53 are both associated with laminopathy-based premature aging, it is conceivable to speculate that loss of Sirt6 may also impact p53 signaling. To determine whether aberrant p53 signaling contributes to the severe progeroid phenotypes in Sirt6-deficient mice, we generated Sirt6-deficient mice with haploinsufficiency (i.e., heterozygous deletion) of <italic>p53</italic> and monitored the growth and survival of the compound mutant mice along with their wild-type and Sirt6 single knockout (KO) littermates. We assessed and compared a range of premature aging-associated abnormalities in our generated compound mutant mice (<italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice), which have been previously reported in Sirt6 single KO (<italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mostoslavsky et al., 2006</xref>). Our findings, revealing the direct link between Sirt6 and p53, underscore the critical role of the Sirt6-p53 regulatory axis in aging and age-associated diseases, which has potential therapeutic implications in healthy aging management.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Upregulation of p53 signaling upon deficiency of Sirt6</title><p>To determine whether p53 signaling is involved in the causation of premature senescence upon loss of Sirt6, we first analyzed the expression of some classical downstream targets of p53 in Sirt6-proficient (Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup>) and deficient (Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup>) primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from littermates, and explored the possibility that functional cross-talk may occur between these two proteins. To this end, 3 batches of primary MEF cells collected from independent batches of embryos were analyzed. To avoid mutations in p53 pathway occurring spontaneously over serial passaging of MEFs, only primary MEFs of P1 or P2 passage were used in experiments, unless stated otherwise. Intriguingly, a range of downstream targets of p53, including p21, Puma, Noxa, Bax and Ddit4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poyurovsky and Prives, 2010</xref>), were upregulated in Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup>mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as compared to Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup>MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous reports stating that loss of Sirt6 results in premature senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mostoslavsky et al., 2006</xref>), Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs exhibited enhanced senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and senescence-like flattened cellular morphology at passage 6 (P6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs also exhibited enhanced p16 levels at P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, haploinsufficiency of <italic>Trp53</italic> significantly rescued the senescence-associated phenotypes in Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs at P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, 3 independent batches of MEFs have been used in the study which were obtained from independent batches of littermate embryos). Also, <italic>Trp53</italic> haploinsufficiency significantly attenuated p16 levels and the enhanced expression of the downstream targets of p53 in Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/-</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Enhancement of sensitivity to DNA damage upon loss of Sirt6 has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mostoslavsky et al., 2006</xref>). Again, the increased sensitivity to DNA damage in Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs treated with gamma-irradiation was substantially attenuated in Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/-</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The decreased cell viability of Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs was significantly improved in Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/-</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To further investigate the effects of partial ablation of <italic>p53</italic> in Sirt6 knockout (KO) background at the organismal level, we used compound heterozygous mating strategy to generate Sirt6 KO mice with haploinsufficiency of <italic>p53</italic> (Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/-</sup> mice) as well as Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> (Sirt6 KO) and Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> (wild-type) littermates. The internal organs, such as kidneys, liver and spleen from these mice were collected for further analyses. Consistent with our findings in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), there was a significant upregulation of the expression of several downstream targets of p53 in the liver, kidneys, and spleen of Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, <italic>Trp53</italic> haploinsufficiency significantly suppressed the expression of those downstream targets of p53 in the liver, kidneys, and spleen of Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This further suggests that the upregulation of these targets upon loss of Sirt6 is indeed a consequence of p53 activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32127.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heterozygosity of <italic>Trp53</italic> rescues premature senescence in Sirt6-deficient scenario, (<italic>Trp53</italic> has been denoted as <italic>p53</italic> in the figures).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification for qPCR analyses for gene expression of p53 targets (with respect to Gapdh controls) in Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> (WT) and Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> (S<italic>irt6</italic> KO) MEFs, respectively.

A previous study has indicated that SIRT6, as a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase, is not responsible for p53 deacetylation at lysine (K) 382 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michishita et al., 2005</xref>). However, given that multiple potential acetylation sites exist in p53 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marouco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reed and Quelle, 2014</xref>), it is conceivable to speculate that SIRT6 may deacetylate p53 at sites other than K382. To test this, we performed in vitro deacetylation assays using eluted FLAG-p53 (purified from HEK293 cells) and recombinant SIRT6 (rh SIRT6). As predicted, we observed that SIRT6 could deacetylate p53 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In line with the nature of SIRT6 as a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase, SIRT6-mediated p53 deacetylation in vitro was abrogated in the absence of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). In addition, this deacetylation was largely diminished in the presence of the sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). In accordance with existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michishita et al., 2005</xref>), we observed no alteration in p53 acetylation at lysine (K) 382 even with increasing concentration of rhSIRT6 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, when checking the other two major sites of acetylation in the C-terminus of p53, that is lysine 381 and 373 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gu and Roeder, 1997</xref>), the pan-acetylation (<italic>i.e.</italic>, total acetylation) and acetylation at K381 of p53 was found to significantly reduce with increasing concentrations of SIRT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). No significant change in the acetylation of p53 at K373 was observed in the presence of rhSIRT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Consistently, p53 acetylation at K381 was upregulated in SIRT6-deficient cells (SIRT6 KO cells) in comparison with mock CRISPR control cells, when assessed with western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Again, no significant change in p53 acetylation at K382 was observed in SIRT6-deficient cells when compared with mock CRISPR control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In agreement with Western blotting results, immunofluorescence staining also showed that p53 acetylation was upregulated at K381, but not K382 in SIRT6-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). When p53 lysine 381 was mutated to arginine (K381R, non-acetylatable mutant), p53 acetylation at this site was no longer detectable, thus confirming the epitope specificity of the antibodies against p53 acetylation at K381 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Additionally, expression of the FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) form of SIRT6 attenuated the upregulated p53 K381 acetylation in SIRT6-deficient HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). However, such attenuation in p53 acetylation at K381 was not observed with the ectopic expression of the catalytically inactive form of SIRT6 (H133Y) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Although 90–95% of the SIRT6 KO cells were stained with antibodies against p53 acetylated at K382, ectopically expressed SIRT6 (both active and catalytically inactive forms) had no effect on p53 acetylation at K382 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Next, we analyzed immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged WT p53 and K381R mutant p53 for acetylation in mock CRISPR control cells and SIRT6-deficient cells. Consistent with data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, pan-acetylation of WT p53 was increased in the SIRT6-deficient cells over control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K and L</xref>) and the K381R mutation caused a significant reduction in pan-acetylation of p53 in both control and SIRT6-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Surprisingly, the increase in pan-acetylation of p53 was largely diminished for K381R mutant in SIRT6-deficient cells as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K and L</xref>). These findings support the idea that the increased p53 pan-acetylation in the absence of SIRT6 is largely attributable to the acetylation status at lysine 381 of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K and L</xref>). Also, endogenous p53 immunoprecipitated from SIRT6 KO HEK293 cells exhibited more acetylation at K381 as compared to mock CRISPR cells, and this increased acetylation of p53 at K381 went down with ectopic expression of wild-type (WT) SIRT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). To further substantiate the observation of upregulation of p53 acetylation at K381 upon Sirt6 deficiency, we tested the same in cells and tissues of mice, and similarly observed upregulation of p53 acetylation at K381 in Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> mice as compared to Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> littermate mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SIRT6 negatively regulates the stability of p53</title><p>It is known that acetylation enhances the stability of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gu and Zhu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kruse and Gu, 2009</xref>). Indeed, HEK293 cells lacking SIRT6 (SIRT6 KO cells) had approximately two-fold increases in the total p53 protein level when compared with mock CRISPR control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining further confirmed the increased endogenous levels of p53 in SIRT6 KO cells as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Similarly, liver and kidney tissues from Sirt6-deficient mice exhibited a significant increase in p53 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). This increase in p53 expression was also observed in Sirt6 null (Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>) primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (passage P2 MEFs were used to avoid alterations because of serial passaging) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide further confirmed the enhanced stability of p53 in SIRT6-deficient cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). However, we did not observe increased phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 in SIRT6-deficient HEK293 cells compared with wild-type cells without irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This phosphorylation of p53 robustly increased in both wild type and Sirt6-deficient cells upon irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This suggests that the upregulation of p53 in SIRT6-deficient cells is unlikely a direct consequence of increased DNA damage in the absence of SIRT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Furthermore, we observed no significant increase in p53 mRNA levels in the absence of Sirt6 in HEK293 cells, MEF cells or mice tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–J</xref>). Hence, it is likely that SIRT6 regulates p53 at the post-translational level.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32127.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>SIRT6 negatively regulates the stability of p53.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blotting analysis of p53 protein expression in SIRT6 KO and control HEK293 cells.

To address this, we generated another mutant construct of p53, with lysine 381 mutated to glutamine (K381Q) by site-directed mutagenesis, which mimics the acetyl form of p53 at K381. FLAG-tagged WT p53, K381R mutant (lysine to arginine, non-acetylatable mutant), and K381Q mutant (lysine to glutamine, acetyl mimic mutant) were ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells individually, followed by treatment with cycloheximide to examine the stability of different mutants of p53.

On the other hand, p53 K381Q mutant displayed improved stability, as evidenced by the comparable protein expression levels before and after cycloheximide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). These findings reinstate that loss of SIRT6 leads to upregulation of p53 acetylation at K381, which further confers stability to p53.

On the other hand, there is no existing literature about the regulation of p53 by SIRT6. In this study, we show that loss of SIRT6 results in increased acetylation of p53, leading to elevated apoptosis and senescence at the cellular level and to accelerated aging in mice. Haploinsufficiency of <italic>Trp53</italic> significantly reduced premature senescence, substantially restored immune cell and stem cell populations, and dramatically extended the lifespan of Sirt6-deficient mice. These data identified a novel SIRT6-p53 axis in the regulation of senescence and aging. Our study reveals a direct link between SIRT6 and p53, wherein the stability of p53 is regulated through SIRT6-mediated deacetylation of p53 at K381. Hence, these findings not only establish p53 as a substrate for SIRT6, but also identify SIRT6-mediated p53 deacetylation as a critical mechanism to suppress cellular senescence and organismal aging. Although we have identified lysine 381 of p53 as a major site of deacetylation by SIRT6, we cannot exclude the possibility that SIRT6 might target other lysine residues of p53 for deacetylation or other post-translational modifications. This would require further investigation in the future.</p><p>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup> mice have been reported to die because of acute aging-associated degenerative processes, such as severe organ degeneration, body wasting, abruptly lowered serum IGF-1 levels, gut inflammation and chronic metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mostoslavsky et al., 2006</xref>). The Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/-</sup> mice showed signs of severe body wasting during their terminal lifespan (around 12-16 months).

(2017)</xref>, consistent with a previous report stating that Sirt6 plays critical roles in the maintenance of retinal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Silberman et al., 2014</xref>). Another possibility cannot be eliminated that the very short lifespan of Sirt6 KO mice could result from oversensitivity to p53 activation associated with the genetic backgrounds used in the respective studies, thus resulting in enhanced cell death even at low DNA damage levels, thereby accelerating aging. Reducing <italic>Trp53</italic> levels by haploinsufficiency likely reduces this effect and hence delays aging, thereby allowing longer lifespan. Regarding cancer incidence, the types of tumors exhibited by Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/-</sup> and Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>Trp53<sup>+/-</sup> mice were very distinct. Given that Sirt6 has already been established as a potent tumor suppressor by several independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lerrer and Cohen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sebastián et al., 2012</xref>), this explains as to why Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>Trp53<sup>+/-</sup> mice exhibit an earlier onset of tumorigenesis and mostly develop tumors other than sarcoma. Hence, sirt6 depletion enhanced the onset and diversified the type of tumors in the Trp53<sup>+/-</sup> background.</p><p>The dramatic lifespan extension observed in the mouse model reported in this study is significantly longer than any other rescue reported so far in mammalian aging models. The lifespan extension reported here is six times longer than the highest rescue of premature aging achieved so far in Sirt6-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawahara et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that the activated p53 pathway may be one of the most critical mechanisms underlying the accelerated aging and premature death in the absence of Sirt6. This further reinstates the importance of the SIRT6-p53 axis in cellular senescence and organismal aging. To also note here is that, though significant, the lifespan extension and phenotype amelioration by <italic>Trp53</italic> haploinsufficiency in Sirt6-deficient mice represent a partial rescue when compared with the wild-type mice. Given that Sirt6 regulates a range of pathways such as NF-κB, IGF1, AKT and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dominy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanfi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawahara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that these pathways may work in orchestra to contribute to the severe premature aging in mice in the absence of Sirt6. It is conceivable that Sirt6 null mice with <italic>Trp53</italic> haploinsufficiency can serve as a better model in evaluating the contribution of other signaling pathways to the premature aging in the absence of Sirt6. In addition, targeting multiple signaling pathways at the same time may further extend the lifespan in Sirt6-deficient mice. Given the recent report stating that inhibition of the interaction between FOXO4 and p53 rescues p53-mediated senescence and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baar et al., 2017</xref>), it would be interesting to analyze if a similar administration of FOXO4 inhibitor could ameliorate aging-associated abnormalities in Sirt6-deficient mice.</p><p>Although the mammalian SIRT1 protein is also known to deacetylate p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Langley et al., 2002</xref>), the lack of any significant rescue of the abnormalities of Sirt1-deficient mice by loss of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamel et al., 2006</xref>) clearly suggests, when viewed alongside our results, distinct roles for SIRT1 and for SIRT6 in the modulation of p53 activity and aging/longevity. In addition, the upregulation of p53 stability and activity in Sirt6-null scenario and the severe premature aging observed in Sirt6-deficient mice, clearly suggest the insufficiency of endogenous SIRT1 in compensating the hyperactivity of p53 under Sirt6-deficient conditions.</p><p>Apart from a better understanding of the contribution of different pathways regulated by SIRT6 to the aging process at the organismal level, the extended lifespan in Sirt6-deficient mice with <italic>Trp53</italic> haploinsufficiency also provides an opportunity to understand the in vivo role for Sirt6 in development, particularly during the maturation as the compound mutant mice survived remarkably long enough with growth retardation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). On the other hand, given both SIRT6 and p53 are potent tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donehower and Lozano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sebastián et al., 2012</xref>) and their regulatory roles in aging, this study opens a new window for future study in the control of choice between aging and cancer development by the balance and cross-talk of p53 and SIRT6. p53 has been widely implicated in premature senescence and aging and is the focus of a large number of studies to develop therapies. For example, independent studies have reported the efficacy of p53 inhibitors in promoting neuroprotection against age-associated neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Culmsee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>). Hence, identification of SIRT6 as a negative regulator of p53 unveils new avenues of research not only for basic scientists but also for those working to develop intervention and therapies against cancer and aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, transfection, recombinant proteins, reagent treatment and antibodies</title><p>HEK293 cells have been purchased from ATCC.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reinhard Fässler as Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.

At the molecular level SIRT6 deacetylates p53 to negatively regulate stability and activity of p53. These findings demonstrate that SIRT6 acts on p53, thereby preventing several features of accelerated aging.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What was their cancer incidence? Since there is significant overlap between the life span curves for sirt6<sup>-/-</sup> p53<sup>+/-</sup> mice and the Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup> p53<sup>+/-</sup> it would be interesting to know if Sirt6 deletion reduces cancer incidence in the p53<sup>+/-</sup> background.</p><p>2) Genetic background of mouse strains is notorious in terms of clinical phenotypes. The authors have used a F2 of pure FVB and pure C57Bl6, which is a wise strategy as it reduces risks associated with the use of only one genetic background which may have unanticipated strain-specific effects on the phenotype. This is even more important as recently the dramatic effect of genetic background on lifespan of Sirt6 mutants has become apparent from several studies including Peshti et al., (2017), using a mixed 129/SvJ/BALB/c background, which extended lifespan in females over 10-fold and in males approximately 5-fold. Also, several aging features exhibited by Sirt6 mutant mice have been found to vary significantly with genetic background. In fact, one explanation for the very short lifespan of the Sirt6 KO mice in the current and other reports could well be that these genetic backgrounds are associated with oversensitivity to p53 activation, causing cell death already at low DNA damage levels thereby accelerating aging. Reducing p53 levels by haplo-insufficiency would reduce this effect and hence delay aging and allow longer lifespan. This possibility should be considered.</p><p>3) It seems that what p53 haploinsufficiency rescues in Sirt6 mice is mostly the growth defect seen in Sirt6-/- animals. This is clearly a postnatal developmental defect that likely reflects the GH/IGF1 axis (in the liver) of these animals and has been shown (also in Sirt6 mice) in other mouse models carrying e.g. DNA repair defects in Nucleotide Excision Repair. The manuscript would benefit from some insights/data on this pathway in Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup> and Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> mice as it would help putting their working model into a larger context. Any data on the metabolic status of Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> animals would also be useful (glucose, triglyceride levels in the serum of Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> mice). The authors provide no information on the frequency of spontaneous tumors in the longest-lived Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> animals. If such data are available, it would be relevant to include them in this work.</p><p>4) The MEF experiments seem carefully done, using independent triplicates and only early passage cells. However, MEFs are extremely unstable and may already acquire chromosomal abnormalities in the first passage of culturing at atmospheric oxygen. Therefore, it is important that MEFs are grown at low (3%, i.e. physiological) levels of O2. This is even more paramount for the p53 and Sirt6 mutants used here because of compromised genome stability mechanisms. M&amp;M does not indicate the conditions under which the MEFs were grown. This point should be clarified in the manuscript.</p><p>5) Can the authors provide information on the cause of death of the Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53wt mice, which live only 4 weeks. In addition, what is the cause of death of the Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> mice? Were causes of death upon haploinsufficiency of p53 different from those with wt p53?</p><p>6) Given the reported role of SIRT6 in DNA repair it is remarkable that no increased S15-Phosphorylation of p53 was observed in Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and subsection “SIRT6 negatively regulates the stability of p53”), since one would expect that spontaneous DNA damage levels would be elevated in the absence of SIRT6. What is the explanation?</p><p>7) The authors use Students unpaired t-test throughout for statistics.

Also, throughout, the authors should indicate how normal distribution of the data was confirmed and in cases where no normal distribution is found, a non-parateric test should be used.</p><p>8) It would be also more informative to plot individual data points in the graphs, instead of using bar graphs with SEM.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32127.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What was their cancer incidence?

Regarding cancer incidence, some of the <italic>Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (WT) mice (approximately 6-8%) developed tumors at around 2-2.5 years, as expected. Approximately 26-28% of <italic>Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice developed tumors by 17-20 months, regardless of gender. This is in consistence with the existing literature stating that haploinsufficiency of <italic>p53</italic> in wild-type background results in increased cancer incidence (Jacks et al., 1994; Tyner et al., 2002). The <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice mostly died within 4 weeks of birth, and no incidence of cancer was observed in this genotype. Interestingly, around 32% of the <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> (compound mutant) mice were detected with obvious tumors upon necropsy close to their terminal lifespan. However, the incidence of cancer in <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice was earlier (9-16 months) than that of the <italic>Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (17-20 months).</p><p>The types of tumors exhibited by <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>and <italic>Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice were very distinct. In consistence with existing literature (Jacks et al., 1994; Tyner et al., 2002), the <italic>Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice mostly developed sarcoma by 17-20 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice developed other types of tumors, such as kidney tumor (19%), prostate tumor (17%), bladder tumor (16%), and pancreatic tumor (8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C, D and E</xref> respectively), while only 3% of them exhibited incidence of sarcoma. Given that Sirt6 has already been established as a potent tumor suppressor by several independent studies (Sebastian et al., 2012; Lerrer and Cohen, 2013), this explains as to why <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit an earlier onset of tumorigenesis and mostly develop tumors other than sarcoma. Indeed, sarcoma incidence in the compound mutants is reduced compared with <italic>p53</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Hence, although <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>and <italic>Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice showed overlap between their lifespan curves, Sirt6 depletion did not reduce, but rather enhanced the onset and diversified the type of tumors in the <italic>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> background, given that Sirt6 is a tumor suppressor itself. These discussions have now been included in the Results section, the Discussion section, and the data on cancer incidence in <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>and <italic>Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice have been presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-F</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Genetic background of mouse strains is notorious in terms of clinical phenotypes.

If such data are available, it would be relevant to include them in this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comments. To this end, we analyzed the GH/IGF1 axis in the mice by checking their serum IGF1 levels. As previously reported (Mostoslavsky et al., 2006), the serum IGF1 levels were drastically reduced in <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice as compared to <italic>Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice at the age of approximately 24 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is reminiscent of the notable reduction of serum IGF1 levels in other mouse models carrying DNA repair defects (Niedernhofer et al., 2006). Interestingly, although less than that of wild-type littermates, the serum IGF1 levels in <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>mice were significantly rescued with respect to <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup> </italic>mice at the age of around 24 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The serum IGF1 levels of <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>mice were slightly lower than that of their wild-type littermates at their terminal stage (10-16 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, the values did not reach significance. This suggests that <italic>p53</italic> haploinsufficiency likely rescues the abnormal IGF-1 levels in <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, thus contributing to the rescue in growth defects and hence lifespan of the mutant mice. However, death of the compound mutant mice is unlikely due to the reduction of IGF1. The data on serum IGF1 levels have now been included in the Results section and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>.</p><p>Apart from serum IGF1 levels, we also analyzed serum glucose levels in the mice. Although <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice displayed a decline in their serum glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), it was not a very significant drop. However, the compound mutant (<italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) mice exhibited an almost comparable serum glucose level to their wild-type littermates at the age of 24 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also analyzed the serum glucose levels of <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>mice during their terminal lifespan (i.e. at 10-16 months of age). Interestingly, <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>mice had slightly reduced serum glucose levels than their wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), thus suggesting that severe metabolic disorders may not be the cause of death for <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>mice.

Although the <italic>Sirt6<sup>+/+</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>MEFs thrived well initially, the <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup> </italic>MEFs were mostly dead in the culture and could not be passaged further. The cell death of P2 <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup> </italic>MEFs at 3% O2 conditions could not even be averted after they have been cultured well at P1 under atmospheric oxygen conditions. <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>MEFs exhibited increased cell survival at P2 and P3 compared with that of <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup> </italic>MEFs. Several independent studies have reported that Sirt6 subdues the damage incurred due to hypoxic conditions in various cells lines and tissues (Maksin-Matveev et al., 2015; Kok et al., 2015; Shun et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016). Loss of Sirt6 in MEFs makes them more vulnerable to cell death under low oxygen conditions. We have now included the culture conditions for MEF cells used in our study in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the authors provide information on the cause of death of the Sirt6-/-p53wt mice, which live only 4 weeks.

Were causes of death upon haploinsufficiency of p53 different from those with wt p53?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice have been reported to die because of acute aging-associated degenerative processes, such as severe organ degeneration, body wasting, abruptly lowered serum IGF-1 levels, chronic metabolic disorders and other degenerative aging-associated phenotypes (Mostoslavsky et al., 2006). It is likely that gut inflammation also contributes to the early death of the animals (Mostoslavsky et al., 2006). Although the <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice always weighed less than their wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F and 2G</xref>), the <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice showed signs of severe body wasting during their terminal lifespan (around 10-16 months). A major fraction of both female and male <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>mice developed severe degenerative phenotypes, with acute loss of vigour and numbness of limbs during their terminal lifespan, and we had to sacrifice those mice when they reached humane end-point at the age of 14-16 months. Upon necropsy, around 32% of the <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> (compound mutant) mice exhibited tumors during their terminal lifespan stage (around 13-16 months for females and around 9-14 months for males). Some <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>female mice succumbed to the disorder of incontinence at around 14-16 months, while around 95% of <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>male mice exhibited penile protrusion at around 9-11 months of age (now included as Figure 3—figure supplement 3F). However, gross metabolic disorders were not evident in most of the terminally ill <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>mice, as evident from their slightly reduced serum glucose levels as compared to their wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Taken together, the <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice died of disorders which are both overlapping with and distinct from <italic>Sirt6<sup>-/-</sup>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice.

What is the explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>Although SIRT6 plays a critical role in DNA damage repair, it has been reported by several independent studies that the endogenous levels of DNA damage in Sirt6-deficient cells are not prominently detected without any exogenous DNA damage induction. For example, enhanced γ-H2AX levels are not evident in SIRT6-deficient cells without any external DNA damage induction (Mostoslavsky et al., 2006; Kaidi et al., 2010; Toiber et al., 2013). Hence, the inherent DNA damage levels are likely not intense enough to be detected by molecular assays, such as analysis of H2AX levels or p53 phosphorylation levels by Western blotting or immunofluorescence staining. It is possible that other repair mechanisms may compensate for the damage incurred from inherent DNA damage in the absence of SIRT6. This might explain why S15 phosphorylation levels of p53 are not significantly elevated in SIRT6-deficient cells without exogenous induction of DNA damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors use Students unpaired t-test throughout for statistics.

Hence it became difficult for us to analyze how skewed our data is, thus making it tough to conclude whether normal distribution has been achieved or not. In such a scenario, since parametric tests are more sensitive and powerful in determining statistically significant differences which non-parametric tests might overlook, we either used Student’s t-test or ANOVA to calculate statistical significance in our results. However, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D and 2E</xref>, where our sample sizes are more than 30, we realized that normal distribution was not reached. Hence, we used Log-Rank (Mantel-Cox) test, which is a non-parametric test, to calculate statistical significance for the Kaplan Meier survival curves of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and 2E</xref>).
