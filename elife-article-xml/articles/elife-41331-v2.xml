transport. Much of what we know about RanBP1 is learned from fungi. Intrigued by the long-standing paradox of harboring an extra NES in animal RanBP1, we discovered utterly unexpected cargo dissociation and nuclear export mechanisms for animal RanBP1. In contrast to CRM1-RanGTP sequestration mechanism of cargo dissociation in fungi, animal RanBP1 solely sequestered RanGTP from nuclear export complexes. In fungi, RanBP1, CRM1 and RanGTP formed a 1:1:1 nuclear export complex; in contrast, animal RanBP1, CRM1 and RanGTP formed a 1:1:2 nuclear export complex. The key feature for the two mechanistic changes from fungi to animals was the loss of affinity between RanBP1-RanGTP and CRM1, since residues mediating their interaction in fungi were not conserved in animals. The biological significances of these different mechanisms in fungi and animals were also studied.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41331.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plant, animal and fungal cells all store their DNA inside the cell’s nucleus. Small molecules can freely cross the membrane that surrounds the nucleus, but pores in the membrane control when larger molecules enter or leave.

In yeast cells, which are often used to study cell biology, this sequence allows cargo to bind to a groove in so-called molecular cargo vehicles, such as a protein called CRM1. A protein called RanGTP binds to CRM1 to supply the energy needed to transport molecules across the membrane.

To find out, Li et al. compared yeast RanBP1 with mouse RanBP1. This revealed that mouse RanBP1 lacks the amino acids that allow it to interact with CRM1 in the fashion of yeast RanBP1. When unloading cargo from CRM1, mouse RanBP1 does not form a complex with Ran and CRM1; instead, it works entirely through removing RanGTP from CRM1. This process is more efficient than the one used by yeast cells, but it uses twice as much energy.</p><p>The results presented by Li et al. demonstrate that even processes that are essential to cells can be optimized to fit the needs of different species.

Exchanges between these compartments are mainly mediated through nuclear pore complex (NPC), a semi-permeable channel that allows only certain classes of molecules to pass through, for example importins and exportins, which are collectively called karyopherin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beck and Hurt, 2017</xref>). Cargo entering the nucleus must possess a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which binds to an importin and enters nucleus through NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rexach and Blobel, 1995</xref>). In the nucleus, the GTP-bound form of Ran (Ras-related nuclear) protein dissociates the importin-NLS cargo, and RanGTP-Importin is exported to cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Izaurralde et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kutay et al., 1997</xref>). For a cargo’s nuclear export, its nuclear export signal (NES) forms a complex with exportin in the presence of RanGTP, and together the trimeric complex translocates to the cytoplasm through NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ullman et al., 1997</xref>). In the cytoplasm, RanGTP complexes (with either importin or exportin-NES) are hydrolyzed to RanGDP by GTPase-activating protein RanGAP, dissembling the complexes and recycling karyopherins and Ran for further rounds of nuclear transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bischoff et al., 1995a</xref>).</p><p>However, importin or exportin-NES displays extremely high affinity (in the nM range) for RanGTP and inhibits RanGAP-facilitated RanGTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischoff and Görlich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Askjaer et al., 1999</xref>). Efficient hydrolysis requires Ran binding proteins containing one or more Ran binding domains (RBDs, around 150 residues each) to dissociate RanGTP from karyopherin prior to hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beddow et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischoff et al., 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vetter et al., 1999</xref>). In human, there are two such proteins, namely RanBP1 and RanBP2. While the predominantly cytoplasmic RanBP1 contains one RBD, the cytoplasmic rim-attached RanBP2 has four RBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischoff et al., 1995b</xref>). These RBDs are the tightest binders of RanGTP, K<sub>d</sub> being around 1 nM, whereas it binds to RanGDP at only approximately 10 µM affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Görlich et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuhlmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delphin et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>In addition, RanBP1 in the cytoplasm functions in the disassembly of nuclear export complexes (also before RanGTP is hydrolyzed), through dissociating NES containing cargoes from the complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Floer and Blobel, 1999</xref>). CRM1 (Chromosomal Region Maintenance 1, also known as Exportin-1) is a major nuclear export factor that is responsible for nuclear export of a plethora of proteins containing NES sequence(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stade et al., 1997</xref>). In yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), after binding to RanGTP and CRM1, RanBP1 allosterically closes the groove, releasing CRM1 cargoes into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koyama and Matsuura, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Sequence analysis indicates that in contrast with fungi RanBP1 (which includes yeast RanBP1), animal RanBP1 contains NES sequence C-terminal to its RBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zolotukhin and Felber, 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is reported that the NES of human RanBP1 (hRanBP1) is responsible for its cytoplasmic accumulation (RanBP1 is a shuttling protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zolotukhin and Felber, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Künzler et al., 2000</xref>). If animal RanBP1 binds to RanGTP-CRM1 similarly as yeast RanBP1 (yRanBP1), an apparent paradox then exists: its NES binding to CRM1 is inhibited by its own RBD. Specifically, if animal RanBP1 binds to CRM1 through NES in the nucleus to prepare for nuclear export, its RBD might immediately interact with RanGTP on CRM1 (because of proximity and high affinity) and dissociate its own NES before animal RanBP1 is exported. One may argue that NES may play a role in recruiting animal RanBP1 to CRM1. However, RanBP1-RanGTP-CRM1 complex displayed much higher affinity than NES-CRM1-RanGTP complex in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maurer et al., 2001</xref>); thus, the recruiting purpose seems unnecessary and unlikely. It should be noted that there are about ten residues between RBD and NES, which are insufficient to cover the distance (about 70 Å) between RBD and NES in space. Therefore in theory, the NES and RBD of animal RanBP1 would not bind to CRM1-RanGTP simultaneously. It is fascinating as to why animal RanBP1 requires an extra NES while fungi RanBP1 does not; what factor(s) prevents animal RBD from dissociating its own NES during its nuclear export; whether the NES of animal RanBP1 functions in cargo dissociation by direct competition with NES of cargo; and how animal RBD and NES binding to CRM1-RanGTP is regulated in time and space in cells. Intrigued by these long-standing questions, we performed biochemical, biophysical, and cellular studies on RanBP1 and related proteins. Our work not only solved those puzzles, but also discovered unexpected animal RanBP1 nuclear export and cargo dissociation mechanisms distinctive from those in the yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mouse and yeast RanBP1 bind to CRM1-RanGTP differently</title><p>In yeast, RanBP1, RanGTP and CRM1 form a tight complex whereby RanBP1 forces H9 loop of CRM1 to allosterically close NES binding groove and dissociate NES. In order to visualize the mode of animal RanBP1’s binding to RanGTP-CRM1, we first attempted to solve the crystal structure of complex formed by mouse RanBP1 (mRanBP1), human RanGTP (hRanGTP) and human CRM1 (hCRM1). However, although the yeast complex formed readily as expected, the equivalent complex with animal proteins hardly formed under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The human and yeast Ran protein shares 83% sequence identity and are often used interchangeably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koyama and Matsuura, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). When RanBP1, RanGTP and CRM1 were mixed at 5:3:1 molar ratio and passed through a size exclusion chromatography column, the yeast proteins formed stable complex and were co-eluted, but not the case for the animal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, a greater amount of animal complex was formed when concentration of RanGTP was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, the yeast complex was not affected by RanGTP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). It should be noted that the mammalian complex was dependent upon high RanGTP but not RanGDP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggest that mRanBP1 is somewhat different from yRanBP1, in forming complex with RanGTP-CRM1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41331.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mouse RanBP1 forms a nuclear export competent complex with hCRM1 only through its NES, and in a RanGTP concentration dependant manner.</title><p>(<bold>A, B, C</bold>) GST tagged mouse/yeast RanBP1 or mutants pull down of CRM1 in the presence of RanGTP.

Surprisingly, both NESmut and ΔC lost binding to hCRM1 completely, in either low or high RanGTP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, NES<sup>mRanBP1</sup> bound to hCRM1 in the presence of RanGTP, and was outcompeted by supraphysiological NES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelsma et al., 2008</xref>) from the Minute Virus of Mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that NES<sup>mRanBP1</sup> is a regular NES that binds to NES groove on hCRM1. Further, the NES of mRanBP1 is weaker than that of regular NES from PKI (Protein kinase inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Previously, it was reported that the NES of mRanBP1 was essential for its nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Plafker and Macara, 2000</xref>). Indeed, while mRanBP1 was localized to the cytoplasm, NESmut (or mRanBP1 in the presence of CRM1 inhibitor KPT-330) was significantly re-localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Unexpectedly, yRanBP1 was exclusively localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, right column), though RanBP1 proteins are known to be cytoplasmic localized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Künzler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Plafker and Macara, 2000</xref>). The reason for this counter-intuitive observation will be explained in later sections. Altogether, these results conclude that the NES of mRanBP1 is necessary and sufficient for its interaction with hCRM1 in the presence of RanGTP, and this interaction is crucial for nuclear export of mRanBP1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mouse RBD dissociates cargo through sequestering RanGTP</title><p>Previously we showed that ΔC or NESmut did not bind to hCRM1 in the presence of RanGTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

To differentiate the two RanGTP proteins in the tetramer, we performed a pull down assay using GST-RanGTP and a truncated form of Ran, Ran<sup>1-179</sup>, which binds to CRM1 but does not bind to mRanBP1 due to lack of C-terminus. Clearly, Ran<sup>1-179</sup> and hCRM1 bound to GST-RanGTP beads in the presence of mRanBP1 but not ΔC or buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The bound Ran<sup>1-179</sup> can be explained by the formation of the proposed tetrameric complex, where GST-RanGTP binds to mRanBP1, which further binds to hCRM1-Ran<sup>1-179</sup> through the NES of mRanBP1. Though ΔC binds to GST-RanGTP, the lack of NES rendered it unable to bind CRM1; therefore there is a lack of Ran<sup>1-179</sup> band in the bound fraction. By size exclusion chromatography, hCRM1, RanGTP, mRanBP1 and Ran<sup>1-179</sup> formed a reasonable 1:1:1:1 complex, whereas Ran<sup>1-179</sup> did not co-elute with CRM1, RanGTP and RanBP1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).

In contrast, the titration of RanGTP into yCRM1 and yRanBP1 displayed merely an exothermic phase representing the formation of the trimeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

We fused one Ran with CYFP (C-terminal fragment of YFP) and another Ran with NYFP (N-terminal fragment of YFP), and co-transfected the two plasmids into 293 T cells. The formation of the tetrameric complex would bring the fluorescent fragments within proximity, promoting the assembly of an intact YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Please note that this assay would not differentiate which Ran fusion binds to RanBP1 (or CRM1) in the tetramer, and possibly that both configurations could elicit YFP signals.

First, unlike yRanBP1 (17), hRanBP1 residues preceding its RBD domain are ordered and inserted between the closely-packed RanGTP and CRM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), possibly hindering trimeric complex formation by steric clash. Second, V150 that is in close proximity with yCRM1 in yRanBP1 corresponds to A114 in hRanBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). V150 is conserved to be valine or isoleucine in fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), but not conserved in hRanBP2 and RanBP1 from human, mouse, zebrafish and frog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The residues discussed above were mutated in NESmut and yRanBP1 to test whether they impact binding towards yCRM1 in the presence of RanGTP. Pull down results showed that either A114V or deletion of N terminus (Del 1–37) on NESmut could partially rescue binding to yCRM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 2 and 4). In agreement, V150A mutation in yRanBP1 partially inhibited binding of yCRM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 7 and 8). In contrast, mutation of more distant residue (A119 in NESmut mutated to yeast-equivalent S) did not significantly affect binding. Triple mutant (A114V, A119S and Del1-37, labelled as TM) rescued yCRM1 binding to a comparable level as yRanBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 6,7). Taken together, both the N-terminus and CRM1 interacting region of animal RanBP1 are incompatible for trimeric complex formation.</p><p>Similarly, several regions of CRM1 were mutated to identify critical sequence changes that abolished the formation of trimeric complex in animals. In the yRanBP1 binding interface, side chain of the strictly conserved yCRM1 T753 is in close contact with yRanBP1 V150 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The corresponding residue in human is Q742, being strictly conserved in animals. Pull down results showed that Q742T mutation partially rescued binding between hCRM1 and yRanBP1-RanGTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, lane 3). Similarly, T753Q or T753G mutation in yCRM1 also reduced its binding to yRanBP1-RanGTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, lane 5–8). V739A mutation in hCRM1 (V739 equivalent residues in yCRM1 is A), however, did not rescue binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, lane 2).</p><p>Besides the yRanBP1 interaction surface discussed above, yRanBP1 binds to yCRM1 indirectly through RanGTP. Human RanGTP forms 26 hydrogen bonds with yCRM1 in yRanBP1-hRan-yCRM1 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), and those residues that form hydrogen bonds are strictly conserved in yeast Ran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, six hydrogen bonds are predicted to be lost if yCRM1 is replaced with hCRM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Five hydrogen bonds are contributed by N-terminal residues (E172, Q42, N116) in yCRM1, and one by a C terminal residue (D947) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Instead of making single mutations individually, the N-terminal 200 residues of hCRM1 were replaced with yeast equivalent residues 1–188, and the chimera protein (hCRM1<sup>N_swap</sup>) was able to weakly bind to yRanBP1-RanGTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, lane 4). Similarly, when the N-terminal 1–188 region of yCRM1 was replaced by human equivalent N-terminal region 1–200 (yCRM1<sup>N_swap</sup>), binding to yRanBP1-RanGTP was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, lane 9). Pull down assay did not produce a significant difference by further mutating D947 (data not shown). Therefore, loss of binding between hCRM1 and yRanBP1-RanGTP is due to sequence divergence of hCRM1 from yCRM1, including the RanBP1 contact surface and Ran contact surfaces.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Identified mutations play important roles in RanBP1 localization and nuclear export of cargo</title><p>Previously, we showed that yeast RanBP1 is localized in the nucleus in HeLa cells.

In both yeast and human, RanBP1 is exported by nuclear export factor CRM1 (19). Though yeast and mammalian proteins are used in this work, the mechanisms revealed in this study should be applicable to fungi and animals. Due to the lack of NES, fungi RanBP1 should form trimeric complex through its RBD interacting with both RanGTP and CRM1. This explains the observation that intact RBD is required for its nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Künzler et al., 2000</xref>). Obviously, NES is not needed for its nuclear export because fungi RBD is sufficient for its nuclear export. In animals, NES but not RBD is required for its export because animal RBD-RanGTP does not bind to CRM1 at sufficient high affinity to be exported. We show that this is due to degeneration of the interface residues essential for the formation of trimeric complex.</p><p>Since nucleus is enriched with RanGTP, a tetrameric animal export complex of (RanBP1-RanGTP)-CRM1-RanGTP would form in animals, whereby RanBP1-RanGTP binds to the NES groove of CRM1 (through the NES of RanBP1) as an NES cargo. It should be noted that animal tetrameric complex probably exists only in the nucleus, whereas the fungi trimeric complex could exist both in nucleus and cytoplasm. In the nucleus, animal RanBP1 cargo dissociation activity is inhibited with excessive RanGTP, and it would not dissociate any CRM1 cargo or its own NES before reaching the cytoplasm. When animal RanBP1 tetrameric complex enters the cytoplasm, where RanBP1/RanGAP is present at high concentration and RanGTP at low concentration, the complex would probably be quickly dissembled (shutting off cytoplasmic YFP signals in the BiFC experiment).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanistic difference between fungi and animal RanBP1’s cargo dissociation</title><p>In the cytoplasm, fungi and animal RanBP1 also use different mechanisms to displace CRM1 cargoes. Both fungi and animals use RBD domains for cargo dissociation, and we showed that NES of animal RanBP1 is dispensable for cargo dissociation. Fungi RanBP1 binds tightly to RanGTP-CRM1 and closes the NES groove to actively release bound NES. This ends up sequestering available CRM1, before RanGTP is hydrolyzed with the help of RanGAP. In animals, excessive RanBP1 (and RanBP2) in the cytoplasm sequesters RanGTP from the NES-CRM1-RanGTP complex, resulting in a transient low-affinity binary CRM1-NES complex, which dissembles automatically. However, we do not exclude the possibility that a transient complex of animal RanBP1-RanGTP-CRM1 forms like the fungi complex, which actively dissociates NES from CRM1, immediately followed by dissociation of RanBP1-RanGTP-CRM1. In fact, active displacement of cargo was observed previously with the yCRM1 mutant (P754D), which is defective in the stable yRanBP1-yRanGTP-yCRM1 ternary complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koyama and Matsuura, 2010</xref>). Consistent with the proposed cargo dissociation mechanisms, we show that in the presence of RanGAP and RanBP1, yeast but not human CRM1 partially inhibits RanGTP hydrolysis.</p><p>Besides dissociating cargo from CRM1, RanBP1 is essential for the disassembly of tightly-bound Ran-karyopherin complexes. In fact, the Ran-sequestering mechanism seems to be more prevalent among RanBP1 mediated RanGTP dissociation from different karyopherins.

For yCRM1, there is no corresponding RanBP1-RanGTP release factor reported thus far.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Biological significances of forming trimeric or tetrameric complex</title><p>Apparently, one round nuclear export of fungi RanBP1 costs energy of hydrolysing one GTP, while one round nuclear export of animal RanBP1 costs energy of two GTPs. Since RanBP1 is a constantly shuttling protein, animals may spend significantly more energy than fungi in the long term. We believe that at the same time of suffering this disadvantage in energy consumption, forming tetrameric complex may also confer at least two advantages for animals. First, as mentioned above, forming tetrameric complex does not inhibit GAP mediated hydrolysis, which means faster recycling rate of nuclear export machinery. This possibly further implies less congestion of nuclear pore and faster rate of nuclear transport, or translated into a higher nucleo-cytoplasmic concentration difference of cargoes. Indeed, we found that both nuclear import and export of cargoes were substantially more efficient in human cells than in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Though we showed that this is not due to differences in binding strength to transport receptors nor cargo expression levels in two types of cells, our results do not eliminate other possibilities such as a leakier NPC in yeast; further experiments are needed to fully understand how much the yeast RanBP1 system (which partially inhibits GAP hydrolysis) contributes to the observed lower concentration gradient of cargoes. Second, the interface region and several other regions in fungi have to be conserved in order to maintain trimeric complex formation and export nuclear RanBP1. In animals, the existence of specialized NES in RanBP1 has eliminated that requirement, allowing multiple regions in both RanBP1 and CRM1 to diverge and participate in other yet-to-be discovered cellular functions. Compared with fungi, animals are readily mobile and more complex in cellular/tissue organization. Whether the appearance of RanBP1 NES in animals is involved in higher order cellular organization, tissue development or independent mobility, and whether the tetrameric complex plays roles in other processes warrant further studies.</p><p>Further, the different mechanisms observed in this study could aid in development of inhibitors against fungi by targeting the critical binding interfaces discussed above to inhibit the formation of trimeric RanBP1 nuclear export complex. Anti-fungal medicines developed by this strategy are potentially safe for human beings, since our RanBP1 nuclear export system does not rely on the formation of the trimeric complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Catalogue no.</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(H. sapiens)</td><td>pcDNA 3.1(+) myc-Ran<sup>WT</sup>-CYFP</td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Used in BiFC</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(H. sapiens)</td><td>pcDNA 3.1(+) <break/>NYFP-Ran<sup>WT</sup>-HA</td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Used in BiFC</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(H. sapiens)</td><td>pcDNA 3.1(+) myc-Ran<sup>Cmut</sup>-CYFP</td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Used in BiFC</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(H. sapiens)</td><td>pcDNA 3.1(+) <break/>NYFP-Ran<sup>Cmut</sup>-HA</td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Used in BiFC</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(H. sapiens)</td><td>pcDNA 3.1(+) <break/>CFP-RanWT</td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Used in FRET</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(H. sapiens)</td><td>pcDNA 3.1(+) myc-RanWT</td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Used in FRET</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(H. sapiens)</td><td>pcDNA 3.1(+) hRanBP1<sup>Δlinker</sup>-NLS</td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Used in FRET</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(H. sapiens)</td><td>pcDNA 3.1(+) hRanBP1<sup>ΔNES</sup>-NLS</td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Used in FRET</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td>pcDNA 3.1(+) <break/>NLS-mRanBP1</td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Used in BiFC</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td>pcDNA 3.1(+) <break/>NLS-NESmut</td><td>this study</td><td/><td>Used in BiFC</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-HA</td><td>Cell Signalling</td><td>3724</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse anti-Myc</td><td>ProteinTech</td><td>60003–2-Ig</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa 647 labelled <break/>Anti-Rabbit IgG</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>A-21244</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Dylight 405 labelled <break/>Anti-mouse IgG</td><td>Beyontime</td><td>A0609</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-GST</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>sc-138</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-RanBP1</td><td>ProteinTech</td><td>27804–1-AP</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-CRM1</td><td>absin</td><td>115104</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-NFκB</td><td>SAB</td><td>48676–1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Digitonin</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab141501</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, protein expression and purification</title><p>The human, mouse or yeast RanBP1 (or their mutants) was cloned into a pGEX-4T1 based expression vector incorporating a TEV-cleavable N-terminal GST-tag fusion.

Since Ran has a very slow intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate, 0.5 µM RCC1 and 100 µM of GTP was added to reload Ran with GTP after each cycle of GAP-mediated hydrolysis in all samples. The samples were then incubated with 0.3 µM yeast RanGAP for 0, 15, 45 and 75 min. Control samples were done with 1 µM CRM1, 1 µM GST-PKI and 0. 3 µM of Ran for both species.

The very low concentration of Triton-X prevents non-specific cytoplasmic binding, but does not permeate nuclear envelopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). After washing, the cells were incubated with either human or yeast proteins (0.1 µM CRM1, 1 µM Ran and 1 µM RanBP1), energy regeneration system, 0.01% Triton-X, for different time points at room temperature with gentle shaking. After reaction, the cells were washed, fixed and visualized by immunostaining with GST antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:400). Statistics were based on measurements from at least 30 cells for each sample, and statistical significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA test in Graphpad software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have shown that animal RanBP1 binds to CRM1 only in the nucleus where there is excessive RanGTP, and forms a complex with CRM1 and two RanGTP proteins through its NES but not RBD. This complex is stable and is exported to the cytoplasm where it is dissembled by RBD containing proteins and RanGAP. In contrast to the CRM1-RanGTP sequestering cargo dissociation mechanism in fungi, animal RanBP1 dissociates cargo through stripping RanGTP from nuclear export complexes. The key difference between fungi and animals is that animal RanBP1-RanGTP does not bind to CRM1 as it does in fungi, due to degeneration of interface residues on both CRM1 and RanBP1, though either change is sufficient to reduce binding. The different mechanisms of RanBP1 nuclear export highlight how animals increase catalysis rate on the expense of more energy consumption. It is unexpected and interesting that while essential functions of orthologous proteins are conserved, profound differences exist in the underlining mechanisms.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Chong Chen, Dr. Yinglan Zhao and Dr. Bao Rui from Sichuan University for helpful discussions.

includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Distinct RanBP1 nuclear export and cargo dissociation mechanisms between fungi and animals&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by two peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper studies the mechanism of how RanBP1 triggers the cargo release from the nuclear export receptor Crm1. The authors find that – despite very high sequence conservation – animal RanBP1 functions differently than its yeast counterpart. Intriguingly, the animal protein seems to require two RanGTP molecules for complex dissociation, which would argue that nuclear protein export in animals requires twice as much energy as in yeast.</p><p>While the paper contains interesting observations for the field, there are several weaknesses that the authors will have to address before the paper can be considered for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper largely describes the differences between the animal and yeast complexes but the physiological relevance of the findings remains unclear. The authors discuss some of the implications but it would be important to test at least some of these possibilities. Of note, by doubling the energy expenditure, animal cells should be able to do 'more work' and could export against a higher concentration difference. Is there any evidence that this is the case in animal cells?</p><p>2) On a similar note, can yeast cells lacking yCRM1 and yRanBP1 be complemented with the two animal counterparts (or vice versa)? Or does the triple mutant rescue the yeast deletion?</p><p>3) Why do both ΔNES and ΔC trigger cargo release, yet both these domains are required for efficient binding?

The authors discuss some of the implications but it would be important to test at least some of these possibilities. Of note, by doubling the energy expenditure, animal cells should be able to do 'more work' and could export against a higher concentration difference. Is there any evidence that this is the case in animal cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We really thank the reviewer for this comment. We measured the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio for transfected cargoes in yeast and human cells, and compared them. Interestingly, the same cargoes that predominantly localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus in animals cells are localized at much lower nucleo-cytoplasmic concentration difference, suggesting possibly more efficient nuclear transport system in animals (new Figure 8C), though these cargoes binds to transport receptors with similar affinity (new Figure 8—figure supplement 1). These are added as Figure 8C, D, and we added a few lines of discussion (subsection “Biological significances of forming trimeric or tetrameric complex”) and a new paragraph describing the obtained results in the subsection “Higher efficiency of nuclear export and import in mammals”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) On a similar note, can yeast cells lacking yCRM1 and yRanBP1 be complemented with the two animal counterparts (or vice versa)? Or does the triple mutant rescue the yeast deletion?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We failed to obtain temperature sensitive yeast strains. However, we successfully performed knock down experiments of the endogenous CRM1 or RanBP1 in mammalian cells and rescues with either human or yeast constructs mentioned. Though yRanBP1 is an essential gene, human RanBP1 knock down and co-comitant transfection of various mammalian or yeast RanBP1 proteins (WT or mutants) did not affect cellular localization of CRM1, nuclear export cargo (NFκB) and nuclear import cargo (GFP-NLS), likely because that there is functional redundant gene RanBP2 in mammals (PMID: 27160050). This result also indicates that the expression level of RanBP1 is probably too low to disrupt cellular RanGTP gradient, in order to show any cargo localization defects. These results are added as Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><p>On the other hand, cytoplasmic localization of endogenous RanBP1 and NFκB was perturbed by siCRM1, which could be rescued by expression of either hCRM1 and yCRM1<sup>T753Q</sup> but not yCRM1 and hCRM<sup>1Q742T</sup> (new Figure 7E-G). It is quite surprising because hCRM1<sup>Q742T</sup> is much more like hCRM1 than yCRM1<sup>T753Q</sup> in sequence, however function-wise the opposite is true. This suggests that the mutation hCRM1Q742T (or yCRM1T753Q) play important roles in protein function. Negative control using transfected mCherry-NLS displayed no localization change under siCRM1 and different rescue conditions (new Figure 7H). These results were described in a new paragraph in the subsection “Identified mutations play important roles in RanBP1 localization and nuclear export of cargo”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why do both ΔNES and ΔC trigger cargo release, yet both these domains are required for efficient binding? What is the phenotype of ΔNES or ΔC mutants when expressed in tissue culture upon knockdown of the endogenous proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>We actually demonstrated that ΔNES and ΔC are neither essential (Figure 1E) nor sufficient (Figure 1C) for binding to CRM1-RanGTP (<underline>subsection “</underline>Mouse RanBP1’s NES is necessary for CRM1 binding and its nuclear export”).</p><p>Knock down endogenous RanBP1 and rescue with ΔNES and ΔC mutants mis-localized the protein to the nucleus (Figure 1F, Figure 7—figure supplement 1).

We performed a more vigorous cargo dissociation experiment (Figure 2A) with a concentration gradient of different RanBP1s to support our argument. This is the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1. We also rewrote this paragraph as: “Pull down assay showed that ΔC or NESmut dissociated cargoes as potently as WT mRanBP1 (Figure 2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 1), suggesting that NES of mRanBP1 is dispensable for cargo dissociation. […] Taken together, we conclude that mRanBP1 does not dissociate cargo through direct competition of cargo’s NES.”</p><p>We actually wrote that “ΔC” is required, not “C terminus”. We replaced ‘ΔC’ with ‘the Ran binding domain’ to avoid confusion. Without C-terminus, the proteins is mis-localized to the nucleus. Please refer to our replies to point 2 and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why does the stable BIFC complex remain in the nucleus at steady state? If functional, it might be expected that the artificial Ran dimer might get stuck in the cytoplasmic after export? Is the BIF Ran complex functional and can it still shuttle? Also, the cells in Figure 5 (particularly the 3rd row) do not look very healthy and the results should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment. Only nucleus has high concentration of RanGTP, which is the prerequisite of RanBP1 tetramer formation. At steady state, probably a fraction of the tetramer is unexported (yet to be exported), which is observed. The transiently formed YFP would probably dissociate after Ran dimer dissociated from the complex in the cytoplasm, since we did not observe cytoplasmic YFP signal. As CRM1 is untouched, we believe that the complex could still shuttle through the NPC as other CRM1 complexes. The tetramer might have undiscovered function in the cytoplasm (or the nucleus). The tetramer should have short cytoplasmic life, and probably would be quickly dissembled, though a small fraction might be able to shuttle back to the nucleus before being dissembled. We modified/added more discussion as: “In the nucleus, animal RanBP1 cargo dissociation activity is inhibited with excessive RanGTP and it would not dissociate any CRM1 cargo or its own NES before reaching the cytoplasm. When animal RanBP1 tetrameric complex enters the cytoplasm, where RanBP1/RanGAP is present at high concentration and RanGTP at low concentration, the complex would be probably quickly dissembled (shutting off cytoplasmic YFP signal in the BiFC experiment).”</p><p>We repeated the whole experiment in Figure 5, replaced those figures with better quality figures and quantify those results as suggested.</p><p>In addition, we performed FRET analysis using florescent labelled Ran proteins to demonstrate tetramer formation in the nucleus. The data showed that FRET is stronger for cells transfected with RanBP1<sup>Δlinker</sup>-NLS than RanBP1<sup>ΔNES</sup>-NLS (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2), suggesting the existence of nuclear tetramer. A few sentences describing the data is added in the subsection “Detection of RanBP1 tetramer in the nucleus”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The description of the in vitro nuclear export assay (in the Materials and methods) is not adequate and it remains unclear how these experiments were performed. Do they first perform nuclear import reactions, then a nuclear export reaction (after washing the cells)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment. The export is done after nuclear import and washing the cells. We rewrote this paragraph with reference to the previous studies and made further description/explanations in the subsection “In vitro nuclear export using semi-permeabilized cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What is the export substrate for these transport assays (it cannot be IBB)?.

If Triton-X100 is used, the authors need to include extensive control experiments to demonstrate that the nuclear envelope is intact in their assay system.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer that pointed this out. The export substrate is GST-NES<sup>PKI</sup>-NLS<sup>IBB</sup> but not GST-IBB. We corrected this error in the Materials and methods (subsection “In vitro nuclear export using semi-permeabilized cells”). Yes we used similar protocols in Figure 3 and Figure 7 (added in Figure 8 legend). The very low concentration of Triton-X is used to prevent non-specific cytoplasmic binding. We provided control images to prove that the nuclear envelope is intact (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors need to show the evidence that their CYFP or NYHP tagged Ran is functional.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for suggesting this experiment.

It is known that when NES is bound, its H9 loop should be shifted away from NES groove to allow NES binding (PMID: 24631835). We rewrote these sentences as “In this model, unlike the yRanBP1 that contacts both yCRM1 and yRanGTP, animal RanBP1’s RBD only binds RanGTP (but not CRM1). Further, in contrast to H9 loop stabilized closure of NES groove in yeast (17), animal CRM1’s H9 loop would be shifted away from the NES groove (as in pdb 3NC0)(30), opening its NES groove for interaction with NES of RanBP1 (Figure 4A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The paper is very difficult to read.

We sent this manuscript to a professional language editor to correct the grammar errors and we made several proof readings. We attempted to solve the crystal structure, but we failed since that it did not form a good complex (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).

Low concentration of Triton-X100 was used to prevent non-specific binding. Triton-X is much cheaper than digitonin, and more stable than BSA and Digitonin when prepared in large stock on shelf.

(added in Figure 3—figure supplement 1) Together with previous data (nuclear import level is similar in the presence of BSA or low Triton-X), we hope it is acceptable that low concentration of Triton-X could be used as a buffer supplement for preventing non-specific binding.

We tried to test Ran to look for differences in cargo nuclear export (hopefully this is what the reviewer requested). However, no statistical cargo distribution difference was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, obviously the rescue experiments also showed similar localization). It is possible that Ran knock down impaired nuclear import and export to similar extent.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Nuclear export of NFκB in the presence of Ran knock down and rescues with Ran fusions.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41331-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In addition, we observed that the expressed Ran fusions is much less compared to the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).

With these data and similar cellular localization pattern (Figure 5—figure supplement 3), we argue that the Ran variants are not mis-folded when expressed, and that their specific binding to RanBP1 made it possible for us to observe what was presented in Figure 5B, which suggest that Ran could form RanBP1 tetramer in the nucleus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The interpretation of the import experiments examining the nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of expressed SV40 T-NLS or PKI-NES substrate in mammalian cells and yeast cells is difficult. The SV40 T NLS has a weaker binding activity for yeast importin α compared to mammalian importin. Also, although the PKI NES apparently display a similar binding activity with yeast CRM1 and mammalian CRM1 in Figure 8—figure supplement 1, binding was only examined at one protein concentration (this is not &quot;affinity&quot;). In addition, the expression levels of NES substrate versus endogenous CRM1/RanGTP proteins in yeast and mammalian cells should be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the interpretation of the comparison between mammalian and yeast cells is difficult (subsection “Biological significances of forming trimeric or tetrameric complex”). We repeated the NES/NLS binding assays with more concentrations, which showed that the binding affinities are very comparable between yeast and human (Figure 8—figure supplement 1B). Indeed, SV40NLS binds to human importin α slightly stronger, which would imply more nucleus localization level in human compared to yeast for mCherry-NES. However, Figure 7C right panel showed the opposite, suggesting that the mCherry-NES localization difference was not due to binding strength difference. These were explain in the main text and Figure 8—figure supplement 1 legend.</p><p>We observed that the expression level of NES in yeast is rather low compared with mammalian cells (huge difference by western as in Figure 8—figure supplement 2A and by the fact that mCherry signal in yeast is hardly observable under microscope). Unfortunately, our human CRM1/Ran antibodies did not recognize yeast proteins (Figure 8—figure supplement 2B). Published reports showed that CRM1 and Ran are expressed at comparable levels in yeast and human cells (Figure 8—figure supplement 2C). Thus, the lower transport efficiency seen in yeast should not be due to saturating amount of expressed cargoes. This discussion is added to main text as: “In addition, mCherry-NES expression level was about 30 times less in yeast cells compared to mammalian cells (Figure 8—figure supplement 2A), while the Ran and CRM1 concentrations in both cells are similar (Figure 8—figure supplement 2B, C), suggesting that the lower export efficiency in yeast should not be due to saturation of export capacity.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
