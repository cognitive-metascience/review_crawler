First, distinct regions of MPC exhibited differential functional connectivity with medial and lateral regions of ventral temporal cortex (VTC). Second, these same medial regions showed selective, but negative, responses to the visual presentation of different stimulus categories, with clear preferences for scenes and faces. Finally, and most critically, these regions were differentially recruited during memory recall of either people or places with a strong familiarity advantage.

MPC is associated with a diverse set of cognitive functions, including (but not restricted to) memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vilberg and Rugg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilmore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim, 2013</xref>) visual scene perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Epstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldassano et al., 2013</xref>), scene construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hassabis et al., 2007</xref>), processing of spatial and other contextual associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bar and Aminoff, 2003</xref>), navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Epstein, 2008</xref>), future thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit and Schacter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szpunar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilmore et al., 2016</xref>), and mental orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peer et al., 2015</xref>). Given such diverse recruitment of MPC across cognitive domains historically considered largely independent (e.g. visual processing, memory), the absence of a clear consensus with regard to the function and overarching organization of MPC is perhaps unsurprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilmore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chrastil, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Network analyses using resting-state-functional-connectivity (RSFC) have identified either a single DMN ‘hub’ region (Buckner et al. 2008) or multiple networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Power et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braga and Buckner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilmore et al., 2018</xref>) that are often described as DMN subnetworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doucet et al., 2011</xref>). Task-based analyses also suggest a fractionation beyond a single region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chrastil, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nelson et al., 2012</xref>) with, for example, evidence that the ventral and dorsal portions of posterior cingulate cortex interact differently with the rest of DMN during cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leech et al., 2011</xref>). Further, recent work has reframed MPC (and the DMN) in terms of large-scale cortical gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>), conceptualizing MPC as the most abstract extension of the ventral visual pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>). Beyond MPC’s link with the DMN, others have described divisions of MPC along both the posterior-anterior and ventral-dorsal axes in terms of cytoarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vogt, 2009</xref>), structural connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parvizi et al., 2006</xref>), RSFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Margulies et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidaurre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bzdok et al., 2015</xref>), and electrocorticography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster and Parvizi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daitch and Parvizi, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The question of the underlying functional organization of MPC is clearly complicated and could potentially benefit from a simple and more unified perspective. A promising lead on one such organization has come from recent work demonstrating a strong functional link between anterior ventral temporal cortex (VTC) and MPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldassano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldassano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silson et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, a small region of MPC directly anterior of (visually) scene-selective medial place area (MPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silson et al., 2016</xref>) showed strong functional connectivity with anterior portions of scene-selective parahippocampal place area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Epstein, 2008</xref>) (aPPA), located in medial VTC. This connectivity-defined region overlaps with regions of MPC engaged during memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Silson et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that the ventral/posterior aspect of MPC may contain distinct areas biased toward scene processing for vision and memory, respectively.</p><p>What else might we learn from examining potential links between MPA and VTC? Whilst the previous functional link between MPC and VTC was based upon parcellating PPA along its posterior-anterior axis, the functional organization of VTC varies more dramatically along the orthogonal medial-lateral axis. Indeed, multiple functional dimensions are thought to be represented along this axis, including category preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanwisher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deen et al., 2017</xref>) (e.g. scenes, objects, tools and faces), eccentricity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcaro and Livingstone, 2017</xref>) (e.g. peripheral, foveal), animacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Konkle and Caramazza, 2013</xref>), and even real-world size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Konkle and Oliva, 2012</xref>). Further, the mid-fusiform sulcus (MFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weiner et al., 2014</xref>) has been identified as an anatomical landmark marking a transition point within each dimension (e.g. scene-selectivity medial of the MFS, face-selectivity lateral of the MFS). These robust functional differences across the medial-lateral axis of VTC—and their well-characterized, category-specific nature—may provide an effective perspective from which to investigate the organizational structure of MPC.</p><p>To investigate whether the functional organization of MPC reflects that of VTC, we conducted three independent fMRI experiments. First, we found that distinct subdivisions of MPC have preferential functional connectivity to anterior portions of medial and lateral VTC, respectfully. Second, these MPC subdivisions showed differential evoked responses to the presentation of different visual categories, with clear evidence for scene and face preferences. Third, and most critically, these subdivisions were selectively recruited during memory recall of either specific places (i.e. scenes) or specific people (i.e. faces). Finally, an independent whole-brain analysis of memory recall effects revealed an even finer division within MPC, with four identifiable regions showing an alternating (place/people) pattern of selective recruitment during memory recall.</p><p>Taken together, these findings provide converging evidence for a reflection of the functional organization of VTC in MPC. This organization was evident at rest, in response to visual stimulation, and most strikingly, during memory recall. The alternating pattern of responses throughout MPC provides a framework for understanding the broader functional organization of MPC and may tie together many of the disparate observations reported across the literature. Collectively, these data support the notion that the functional organization defining the medial-lateral axis of VTC is reflected along the ventral/posterior-dorsal/anterior axis MPC, but in the context of memory retrieval.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subdivisions of MPC show preferential functional connectivity with medial and lateral portions of VTC</title><p>To determine whether the functional organization along the medial-lateral axis of VTC is reflected in MPC, we first utilized resting-state functional connectivity data (n = 65).

The overall pattern of negative responses evoked by visual stimuli is consistent with the widely-reported negative responses within MPC (and the broader DMN) when orienting to external stimuli<sup>27</sup>. However, motivated by the apparent scene and face preference within these regions and the fact that MPC is typically engaged positively during introspective tasks such as scene-construction from memory and mental imagery, we hypothesized that these MPC subdivisions would become differentially recruited during memory recall of either specific places (MPCv) or specific people (MPCd), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Subdivisions of MPC differentially recruited during memory recall of specific places or specific people</title><p>To investigate the hypothesis that MPCv/MPCd would be differentially recruited during memory recall of specific places and people, respectively, we conducted a memory recall experiment in a third independent group of participants (n = 24).

Here, a simple 2 × 2 design was employed with two categories (Places, People) and two levels of familiarity (Famous, Personal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Such a design allowed us to test the predictions that MPCv/MPCd would be selectively recruited during recall of specific places and people, respectively, whilst the addition of personally relevant stimuli provided a means to assess whether such category-selective recruitment was dependent on the richness of internal representations.

Accordingly, we performed a whole-brain Linear-Mixed-Effects (LME) modelling analysis to look for regions of the brain displaying main effects of Category (Places, People), Familiarity (Famous, Personal) and their interaction (see Materials and methods). At the whole-brain level, we did not observe any regions showing a significant interaction (at the selected statistical threshold), although significant responses to both main effects were present. The main effect of Category (collapsed across familiarity) revealed a complex pattern of differential recruitment throughout the brain. Most strikingly, along the ventral/posterior-dorsal/anterior axis of MPC, we observed an alternating pattern of memory recall: four adjacent subdivisions that alternated between being selectively recruited by the recall of places, then people, then places and finally people (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Notably, the first two subdivisions (refereed to here as ROIs 1 and 2) were largely equivalent to the connectivity-defined MPCv and MPCd (see Supplementary Material for spatial overlap). Thus, this analysis not only confirmed the differential recruitment during memory recall of MPCv and MPCd, but also, revealed two anterior subdivisions within bilateral MPC that showed similar patterns of selective recruitment (ROIs 3 and 4). Strong memory recall for places was also present in aPPA in both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). In contrast to the alternating pattern of place and people recall, the effect of familiarity (collapsed across category) manifested as an advantage for the recall of personally familiar over famous stimuli, irrespective of category within a relatively large swath of MPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47391.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Familiarity and Category-selective recall in MPC.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Medial views of both the left and right hemispheres of a representative participant are shown.

These subdivisions exhibited different (albeit negative) responses to visually presented categories and were differentially recruited during memory recall. During the recall of specific places, MPCv showed strong positive evoked responses, which contrasted with negative evoked responses during the recall of specific people. In contrast, MPCd showed largely the opposite pattern - large positive evoked responses during recall of personally familiar people, but not during the recall of either famous people or places. These data show a clear division between ventral/posterior and dorsal/anterior portions of MPC based on the content of the recalled memory. This division is broadly consistent with prior anatomical (Vogt, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parvizi et al., 2006</xref>) and functional imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Margulies et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidaurre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster and Parvizi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peer et al., 2015</xref>) work that also identified divisions within MPC along this axis, but did not do so on the basis of recalled content.</p><p>The cortical locations of MPCv/MPCd are consistent with previous observations of memory related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilmore et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuhl and Chun, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the locations of MPCv/MPCd are qualitatively similar to regions recruited when participant’s mentally oriented by either making egocentric distance judgments between two places (i.e. which location is physically closest to them), or between two people (i.e. which of two people are personally closer to them), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peer et al., 2015</xref>). Although such a distance judgement undoubtedly requires recalling specific information, our findings suggest that an explicit distance task is not required to functionally isolate MPCv and MPCd. In the current study, participants were not asked to make social and spatial distance judgments, but merely to recall from memory either specific people or places. This, we believe, provides strong evidence for the role that MPCv/MPCd play in our ability to recall specific features from memory—and seemingly in a manner that recapitulates VTC organization.</p><p>Importantly, we also identify a second pair of anterior regions along the same ventral/posterior-dorsal/anterior axis, that fall anterior of the ‘place’ and ‘people’ regions reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peer et al.

One intriguing feature of this anterior pair of regions was that the pattern of selective recruitment remained despite an overall reduction in the magnitude of responses to recalled stimuli, as compared to MPCv/MPCd. The location of this anterior pair appears qualitatively similar to the ‘time’ region identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peer et al. (2015)</xref>. It is possible that the posterior and anterior pairs we identified play complementary and yet different roles in representing information about people and places. Elucidating any potential differences between these pairs of regions and how they may relate to the representations of time reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peer et al.

The present work informs other recent parcellations of MPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chrastil, 2018</xref>); Power et al. 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braga and Buckner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>). For example, a recent meta-analysis attempted to divide a ventral portion of MPC (referred to as retrosplenial complex) on the basis of different fMRI task activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chrastil, 2018</xref>). Although the majority of MPC was found to be recruited during memory tasks, a ventral/posterior region was more likely to be recruited during scene and navigation-related tasks, whilst more dorsal/anterior portions were more likely to be involved in theory-of-mind and social/emotional tasks. Similarly, a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>) separated social regions of MPC (i.e. those engaged with theory-of-mind tasks) from those involved with constructive memory or the formation of contextual associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hassabis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bar and Aminoff, 2003</xref>). These divisions align well with the differential memory recall effects reported here. The dorsal and ventral divisions also align well with recent studies that have attempted to map social network representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parkinson et al., 2017</xref>) and representations of familiar scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sugiura et al., 2005</xref>), respectively. Our results provide a framework for understanding these previously-reported mnemonic effects by highlighting the apparent organizational link between the ventral/posterior-dorsal/anterior axis of MPC and the medial-lateral axis of VTC. Perhaps more importantly, these robust effects were evoked by the relatively simple task of recalling items that were cued by word stimuli only (or even merely perceiving presented stimuli), as opposed to performing more complex contextual association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hassabis et al., 2007</xref>), navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chrastil, 2018</xref>), social judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parkinson et al., 2017</xref>), or mental orientation tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peer et al., 2015</xref>). Such strong recruitment of MPC through a simple paradigm is consistent with recent work showing that MPC (and the larger DMN) plays a role in simple spatial judgments of shapes and objects, particularly when made from memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Konishi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, these simple paradigms pave the way for future research to potentially address functional heterogeneity in MPC using tasks that target specific cognitive processes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relating MPC to large-scale cortical networks</title><p>The role of MPC is often considered in the context of the DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>). Although initially conceived as a singular entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>), the DMN has more recently been divided into two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shirer et al., 2012</xref>) or three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>) subnetworks.

Our results challenge this ‘core’ conceptualization by suggesting that MPC is fractionated along the same lines as these subnetworks: the dorsal component of the DMN, which overlapped regions recruited during people memory, is associated with social/semantic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>), while, the ventral component, which is often referred to as a ‘scene construction’ or ‘contextual association’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hassabis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bar and Aminoff, 2003</xref>) network overlaps with regions recruited during place memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47391.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>People and Place memory areas of MPC correspond to the dorsal and ventral DMN subnetworks.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Medial views of both the left and right hemispheres are shown (TT n27 surface).

This framework is also consistent with recent work using highly-sampled participants to identify two parallel and interdigitated networks spanning cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braga and Buckner, 2017</xref>). These two functional networks—both of which appeared to overlap with the canonical DMN—could be differentiated through functional connectivity, given sufficient data, but stopped short of describing their specific functional organization. Our data provide a possible functional account of these networks by anchoring them to differential recruitment based on the content of perceived images as well as recalled memories, and moreover, demonstrate that such an interdigitated pattern of regions can be identified at the group-level given appropriate tasks.</p><p>The MPC regions we report also appear to overlap with the recently proposed ‘posterior medial’ (PM) memory system and the effects we observe are broadly consistent with the notion that the PM system is involved in recollecting episodic details, constructive uses of memory, and social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</xref>). However, the present work suggests a differentiation within the PM system based on the recall of places and people, which was not discussed originally, suggesting that MPC’s role in memory recall does not fit neatly into a simple ‘binary systems’ model. More recently, a parietal memory network (PMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilmore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McDermott et al., 2017</xref>) has been identified, which includes regions within both lateral parietal cortex and MPC that are thought to be distinct from those within the DMN/PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gilmore et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilmore et al., 2019b</xref>) system. The memory effects we report overlap with DMN regions and appear close to, but separate from, those within the PMN (i.e., do not extend to mid-cingulate cortex or posterior aspects of the precuneus). This adjacency reinforces the conceptual separation of processes associated with the PMN and the DMN/PM system, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional correspondence between VTC and MPC</title><p>Multiple interrelated functional organizations are thought to be represented along the medial-lateral axis of VTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanwisher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcaro and Livingstone, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Konkle and Caramazza, 2013</xref>). How the current data fit in the context of these organizations thus requires careful consideration.</p><p>Category-selectivity is one organizing principle thought to define the medial-lateral axis of VTC. Even at early stages of cortical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcaro and Livingstone, 2017</xref>), category-selective regions appear in stereotypical locations across individuals. This consistency across individuals and developmental time-frames supports the notion that categories are represented within discrete regions of VTC. The pattern of functional-connectivity, perceptual and memory recall effects we report are consistent with the presence of this motif within MPC. However, other functional dimensions are also thought to be represented along the medial-lateral axis of VTC, and the extent to which they interact and relate to one-another, and in-turn relate to the organization of MPC, is an open question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcaro and Livingstone, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Livingstone et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>For example, eccentricity also varies systematically along the medial-lateral axis of VTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levy et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, these eccentricity representations are so highly correlated with category preference (e.g. PPA is peripherally biased, whereas FFA is foveally biased) that eccentricity has been suggested to form a prototypical organization onto which such selectivity later develops with visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Silson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcaro and Livingstone, 2017</xref>). It may be that the selective recruitment we observe in MPC during memory recall arises in a similar manner: That is, it is possible that the development of categorical-preference in VTC during perception drives the development of categorical-preference in MPC for memory. Such a proposition is compatible with recent work focusing on large-scale cortical gradients that conceptualized the DMN, including MPC, as an abstract extension of VTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>), although in the current study we observed effects that appeared to follow a distinct regional—rather than gradient-like—organization. Alternatively, it is possible that the manner in which mnemonic representations of places and people are encoded and retrieved in MPC, differ in a way reminiscent of how the visual perception of places and people in VTC differ in terms of peripheral/foveal stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The correspondence between MPC organization and the multiple dimensions thought to be represented across VTC, are key questions for future research. Importantly, these accounts are consistent with theories that suggest the organization of category representations in the brain are determined by the underlying structural (i.e. anatomical) and functional (e.g. perceptual) template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Nature of responses within MPC during perception</title><p>The responses of MPCv/MPCd during perception share similarities with VTC but differ in important ways. For instance, responses in VTC during perception are characterized by larger evoked positive responses to stimuli of the preferred category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silson et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, perceptual responses within MPCv/MPCd were best characterized by negative evoked responses that were attenuated, although not extinguished, by category-preference. Despite appearing to share category representations, there was no clear relationship between the positively and negatively evoked responses between the VTC regions and their paired MPC region (e.g. anterior medial VTC – MPCv), at least at the across participant level. Although the relationship between negative BOLD-signal changes and the underlying neural activity is an area of ongoing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shmuel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shmuel et al., 2006</xref>) and has been associated with inhibition in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2004</xref>), this response is consistent with the widely-observed ‘task-negative’ activation of the larger DMN and the MPC component of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>). The current study did not compare directly the responses to perceived and subsequently recalled stimuli. It is possible that the degree of attenuation of the negative response during perception is related to the degree of recruitment during recall in MPCv/MPCd (for related discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daselaar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daselaar et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we identified a consistent differentiation of regions within MPC, providing a new framework for understanding and investigating the functional organization of MPC and its role in memory retrieval.

These data provide converging evidence that the functional organization defining the medial-lateral axis of VTC is reflected along the ventral/posterior-dorsal/anterior axis of MPC, but in the context of memory recall.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants for all experiments were recruited from the DC area and NIH community.

The region of VTC we considered was longer in the posterior-anterior direction than it was wide in the medial-lateral direction and so we chose to sample it using a 3 × 2 ROI scheme. Accordingly, Six ROIs were defined that divided VTC along both the posterior-anterior and medial-lateral axes with respect to the mid-fusiform sulcus on a standard surface mesh that was aligned to the anatomy of an independent participant (not included in this study). The surface vertices within these ROIs were transformed into each individual participant’s surface.

Importantly, however, MPCd did show the predicted Category by Familiarity interaction, which reflects a larger familiarity difference for the recall of people over places. Supplementary file 1c: Statistical analysis of memory effects in ROI 1. Table includes Fvalues, degrees of freedom (<italic>df</italic>), <italic>p</italic>-values and estimates of effect size using partial eta squared. ROI one showed significant main effects of Category, Familiarity and Hemisphere. These were qualified by a significant three-way interaction, reflecting a larger familiarity difference (Personal &gt;Famous) between categories (Places &gt; People) in the right over left hemisphere. Supplementary file 1d: Statistical analysis of memory effects in ROI 2. Table includes Fvalues, degrees of freedom (<italic>df</italic>), <italic>p</italic>-values and estimates of effect size using partial eta squared. ROI two showed significant main effects of Category, Familiarity and Hemisphere, but did not show a significant three-way interaction. Importantly, however, ROI two did show the predicted Category by Familiarity interaction, which reflects a larger familiarity difference for the recall of people over places. Supplementary file 1e: Statistical analysis of memory effects in ROI 3. Table includes Fvalues, degrees of freedom (<italic>df</italic>), <italic>p</italic>-values and estimates of effect size using partial eta squared. ROI three showed significant main effects of Category, Familiarity, but not Hemisphere. Although ROI three did not show a significant three-way interaction, ROI three did show the predicted Category by Familiarity interaction, which reflects a larger familiarity difference for the recall of places over people. Supplementary file 1f: Statistical analysis of memory effects in ROI 4. Table includes Fvalues, degrees of freedom (<italic>df</italic>), <italic>p</italic>-values and estimates of effect size using partial eta squared. ROI four showed significant main effects of Category, Familiarity and Hemisphere. These were qualified by a significant three-way interaction, reflecting a larger familiarity difference (Personal &gt;Famous) between categories (People &gt; Places) in the right over left hemisphere. Supplementary file 1g: Statistical analysis of memory effects in PPA and FFA. Table includes Fvalues, degrees of freedom (<italic>df</italic>), <italic>p</italic>-values and estimates of effect size using partial eta squared. PPA showed significant main effects of Category and Familiarity, but not Hemisphere. PPA only showed a significant Category by Familiarity interaction, reflecting a larger familiarity difference (Personal &gt;Famous) between categories (Places &gt; People) with no clear difference between hemispheres. In contrast, FFA showed significant main effects of Category and Hemisphere, but not Familiarity. These were qualified by a significant three-way interaction, which reflects the presence of category and familiarity in the left hemisphere, but only the effect of category in the right hemisphere. Supplementary file 1h: Statistical analysis of memory effects in the Hippocampus and Amygdala Table includes Fvalues, degrees of freedom (<italic>df</italic>), <italic>p</italic>-values and estimates of effect size using partial eta squared. The Hippocampus showed significant main effects of Category and Familiarity, but not Hemisphere. Only the Category by Hemisphere interaction was significant. The Amygdala showed only a significant effect of Category, with larger responses for the recall of people irrespective of the level of familiarity. Supplementary file 1i: Statistical analysis of the resting-state functional connectivity between MPCv, MPCd and Foveal, Peripheral portions of early visual cortex (EVC). Table includes F-values, degrees of freedom (<italic>df</italic>), <italic>p</italic>-values and estimates of effect size using partial eta squared. The main effects of ROI and Hemisphere were not significant, but the main effect of Eccentricity was reflecting on average stringer connectivity with peripheral than foveal portions of EVC. These were qualified however by a significant three-way interaction, reflecting on average stronger connectivity between MPCv and peripheral EVC, but stronger connectivity between MPCd and foveal EVC in the left over right hemispheres.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-47391-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Leech (Reviewer #2) and Jonathan Smallwood (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Across three experiments, the authors demonstrate the division of human medial parietal cortex (MPC) into 4 alternating regions that are preferentially activated during memory recall of familiar people or familiar places. The first experiment shows that there are two MPC regions (MPCv and MPCd) that are respectively coupled (during the resting-state) with a medial anterior ventral temporal cortex (VTC) region and a lateral anterior VTC region (on either side of the mid-fusiform sulcus). The second experiment shows that MPCv is the least de-activated when subjects are visually presented with scenes, while MPCd is the least de-activated when subjects are visually presented with faces. The third experiment shows that MPCv was most strongly activated during memory recall of familiar places, while MPCd was most strongly activated during memory recall of familiar people. A whole brain analysis then revealed 2 more alternating patches in MPC that are strongly activated during memory recall of familiar places and familiar people respectively. The reviewers and editors felt that the experiments are well motivated and the analyzes are well-conducted and appropriate. The conclusions are also generally sound. Our main concern is that this work should be better situated with respect to the broader literature, some of which we have listed below under &quot;essential revisions&quot;.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is some important prior literature that is not cited and that as a result the Introduction is incomplete. For example, the authors state that previous literature &quot;stopped short of describing a clear organizational structure. Thus, identifying a functional organization that provides synthesis across MPC is an important goal spanning multiple research fields…&quot; However, the division of the posteriomedial surface of the cortex along dorsal-ventral/anterior-posterior gradients has been described in prior work e.g., cytoarchitecture and perfusion (e.g., Vogt, 2009), structural connectivity (Parvizi et al., 2006) functional connectivity (in humans and macaque monkeys, Margulies et al., 2009), MEG (Vidaurre et al., 2018) and ECOG (Foster et al., 2012) as well as other studies (e.g. Leech, et al., 2011, Bzdok et al., 2015, Peer et al., 2015). Other work has embedded the PCC as well as the rest of the default mode network in the context of large-scale cortical gradients, that include those in the ventral stream that this study is focused on (i.e. Margulies et al., 2016).

For example, the authors state that previous literature &quot;stopped short of describing a clear organizational structure. Thus, identifying a functional organization that provides synthesis across MPC is an important goal spanning multiple research fields…&quot; However, the division of the posteriomedial surface of the cortex along dorsal-ventral/anterior-posterior gradients has been described in prior work e.g., cytoarchitecture and perfusion (e.g., Vogt, 2009), structural connectivity (Parvizi et al., 2006) functional connectivity (in humans and macaque monkeys, Margulies et al., 2009), MEG (Vidaurre et al., 2018) and ECOG (Foster et al., 2012) as well as other studies (e.g. Leech, et al., 2011, Bzdok et al., 2015, Peer et al., 2015). Other work has embedded the PCC as well as the rest of the default mode network in the context of large-scale cortical gradients, that include those in the ventral stream that this study is focused on (i.e. Margulies et al., 2016). In particular this viewpoint sees the default mode network as the most abstract extension of the ventral visual stream, and this has been shown to be important for memory retrieval (Murphy et al., 2018, 2019 both in Neuroimage).

Accordingly, we have added sections to the Introduction describing both the anatomical boundaries subsumed by the MPC label, as well as, how previous work has identified divisions within MPC using both anatomical and multiple functional approaches. These sections are pasted below for reference and appear in blue in the revised manuscript.</p><p>“Human medial parietal cortex (MPC), a core component of the default mode network (DMN) (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010), comprises a relatively large expanse of cortex, spanning the parieto-occipital sulcus to the splenium of the corpus collosum anteriorly and dorsally to include the precuneus and both the ventral and dorsal portions of the posterior cingulate cortex (Bzdok et al., 2015).”</p><p>“Network analyses using resting-state-functional-connectivity (RSFC) have identified either a single DMN “hub” region (Buckner et al., 2008) or multiple networks (Power et al., 2014; Braga and Buckner, 2017; Gilmore et al., 2018) that are often described as DMN subnetworks (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010; Yeo et al., 2011; Doucet et al., 2011). […] Beyond MPC’s link with the DMN, others have described divisions of MPC along both the posterior-anterior and ventraldorsal axes in terms of cytoarchitecture (Vogt, 2009), structural connectivity (Parvi zi et al., 2006), RSFC (Marguiles et al., 2009; Vidaurre et al., 2018; Bzdok et al., 2015), and electrocorticography (Foster et al., 2012; Daitch and Parvizi, 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This issue also applies to the Discussion e.g., &quot;…demonstrate a more heterogenous organization within MPC than previously reported (Vilberg and Rugg, 2008; Wagner et al., 2005; Gilmore et al., 2015; Kim, 2013; Valensteinet et al., 1987; Arnott et al., 2008; Gainotti et al., 1998).&quot;; subsection “Functional correspondence between VTC and MPC; &quot;Perhaps more importantly, these robust effects were evoked by the relatively simple task of recalling items that were cued by word stimuli only (or even merely perceiving presented stimuli), as opposed to performing more complex contextual association (Hassabis et al., 2007), navigation (Chrastil, 2018) or social judgment tasks Parkinson et al., 2017).&quot; Overall, the discussion and conclusions should reflect the wider work about the MPC's functional architecture: e.g., while the results suggest a functional dissociation between dorsal and ventral MPC, they might not really indicate the functional role of the dorsal region: e.g., task related BOLD signal changes from this region are small, especially given the high level of metabolism across much of the MPC).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we now discuss how our results mesh with the existing literature.

[…] Elucidating any potential differences between these pairs of regions and how they may relate to the representations of time reported by Peer et al., 2015, are key goals for future work.”</p><p><bold>“</bold>Such strong recruitment of MPC through a simple paradigm is consistent with recent work showing that MPC (and the larger DMN) plays a role in simple spatial judgments of shapes and objects, particularly when made from memory (Konishi et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 2018; 2019). Consequently, these simple paradigms pave the way for future research to potentially address functional heterogeneity in MPC using tasks that target specific cognitive processes.”</p><p>“Such a proposition is compatible with recent work focusing on largescale cortical gradients that conceptualized the DMN, including MPC, as an abstract extension of VTC (Margulies et al., 2016), although in the current study we observed effects that appeared to follow a distinct regional—rather than gradient-like— organization.”</p><p>“The current study did not compare directly the responses to perceived and subsequently recalled stimuli. It is possible that the degree of attenuation of the negative response during perception is related to the degree of recruitment during recall in MPCv/MPCd (for related discussion, see Daselaar et al., 2004; 2009).”</p><p>“Such division of MPC is consistent with previous anatomical (Vogt, 2009) and functional (Marguiles et al., 2016; Peer et al., 2015; Foster et al., 2012, Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014; Leech et al., 2011) distinctions, but suggests that these divisions can be seen on the basis of recalled content.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Peer et al., 2015 demonstrated three MPC regions: one activated most strongly when orienting to space (the location is very similar to MPCv in this paper), one activated most strongly when orienting to person (the location is very similar to MPCd in this paper) and one activated most strongly when orienting in time.

The overall spatial location of the ‘space’ and ‘person’ regions shown by Peer and colleagues appear qualitatively to correspond with the MPCv and MPCd regions we identify. The major differences, however, are in how these regions were recruited. Peer and colleagues presented participants with two stimuli on each trial (either names of cities, names of people or events in time) and asked them to make an explicit egocentric distance judgement, whereas in the current paradigm participants were simply asked to recall from memory the target stimulus as vividly as possible. We believe our paradigm provides strong evidence that MPCv and MPCd play a general role in recalling from memory specific people and places and, moreover, that explicit distance judgements or decisions are not necessary to engage these regions. We now include a discussion of the similarities and differences between the two studies in the revised manuscript.</p><p>“The cortical locations of MPCv/MPCd are consistent with previous observations of memory related activity (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010; Peer et al. 2015; Gilmore et al., 2018; Kuhl and Chun, 2014; Chen et al., 2017).
