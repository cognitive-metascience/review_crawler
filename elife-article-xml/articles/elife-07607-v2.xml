cells. Both peptides are made by CylM, a member of the LanM lanthipeptide synthetases. CylM catalyzes seven dehydrations of Ser and Thr residues and three cyclization reactions during the biosynthesis of the cytolysin large subunit. We present here the 2.2 Å resolution structure of CylM, the first structural information on a LanM. Unexpectedly, the structure reveals that the dehydratase domain of CylM resembles the catalytic core of eukaryotic lipid kinases, despite the absence of clear sequence homology. The kinase and phosphate elimination active sites that affect net dehydration are immediately adjacent to each other. Characterization of mutants provided insights into the mechanism of the dehydration process. The structure is also of interest because of the interactions of human homologs of lanthipeptide cyclases with kinases such as mammalian target of rapamycin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07607.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07607.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07607.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> is a bacterium that is usually found living harmlessly in the gut of humans and other mammals. However, over the past few decades hospitals have noted an increase in the number of hospital-acquired infections caused by antibiotic-resistant strains of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.</p><p>Many of the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains that cause illness and death do so by producing a toxin called cytolysin, which can destroy a range of cells, including the immune cells that normally eradicate bacterial infections. Inside the bacteria, an enzyme called cytolysin synthetase—also known as CylM—catalyzes the reactions that make the cytolysin toxin from precursor molecules.</p><p>Enzymes are primarily made up of proteins. Both the sequence of the amino acids in the protein chains and the shapes and structures that these chains fold into affect how the enzyme works. CylM is made up of two parts, or ‘domains’. One of these, known as the dehydration domain, removes water molecules from some of the precursor amino acid chains that are used to build cytolysin. This dehydration reaction forms the first stage of cytolysin production. How CylM catalyzes this reaction was not known, because CylM does not have a similar amino acid sequence to any other enzymes and no information about its structure was available.</p><p>Now, Dong, Tang et al. have resolved the structure of the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> CylM enzyme using a technique called x-ray crystallography. Unexpectedly, this revealed that the dehydration domain of the enzyme has a similar structure—despite having a completely different amino acid sequence—to enzymes that are found in eukaryotic organisms (i.e., organisms with cells that contain a nucleus). These enzymes are called lipid kinases, and help to add phosphate groups to other molecules.</p><p>Additional structural and biochemical analyses enabled Dong, Tang et al. to investigate how CylM catalyzes the dehydration reaction in more detail. Given its central role in toxin production, an increased understanding of how CylM makes cytolysin could eventually help to develop new treatments for the conditions caused by <italic>E. faecalis</italic> infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07607.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07607.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>lanthipeptide</kwd><kwd>dehydration</kwd><kwd>kinase</kwd><kwd><italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM058822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Donk</surname><given-names>Wilfred A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM079038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nair</surname><given-names>Satish K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The bacterial cytolysin synthetase CylM has a eukaryotic lipid kinase fold despite the absence of any clear sequence similarity, and contains adjacent phosphorylation and phosphate elimination active sites and an ordered activation loop in the absence of peptide substrate or regulatory proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytolysin is produced by many clinical isolates of <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and consists of two post-translationally modified peptides termed cytolysin L and S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilmore et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cox et al., 2005</xref>).

The production of cytolysin enhances virulence in infection models of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, and epidemiological data support an association with acute patient mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ike and Clewell, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huycke et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chow et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Tyne et al., 2013</xref>). Cytolysin is a member of the lanthipeptides, a family of polycyclic peptides that are made in a two-step process involving dehydration of Ser and Thr residues to dehydroamino acids and subsequent addition of thiols of Cys residues to the dehydroamino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knerr and van der Donk, 2012</xref>). This process, catalyzed by the enzyme CylM for cytolysin, generates the characteristic thioether crosslinks called lanthionine (Lan) and methyllanthionine (MeLan) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). An N-terminal leader peptide in the substrates is important for substrate binding by lanthipeptide biosynthetic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oman and van der Donk, 2010</xref>), but the post-translational modifications take place in the C-terminal core peptides.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07607.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biosynthesis of the enterococcal cytolysin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Biosynthetic route to cytolysin S (small subunit of cytolysin) and the structure of cytolysin L (large subunit of cytolysin).

The thioether bridges introduce conformational constraints that facilitate target binding and reduce proteolytic susceptibility. The four routes differ primarily in the mechanism of dehydration. For the class I, III, and IV lanthipeptides, the mechanism of dehydration has been illuminated by crystallographic characterization of the dehydratases or close sequence homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ortega et al., 2015</xref>), but the mechanism of dehydration for class II lanthipeptide synthetases (LanMs) that include CylM has remained enigmatic. These enzymes show no clear sequence homology with non-lanthipeptide proteins and despite two decades of investigation, structural information on class II lanthipeptide synthetases has been unavailable. Such information would be valuable for obtaining inhibitors of cytolysin biosynthesis that could be therapeutically valuable. In addition, LanM lanthipeptide synthetases are involved in the biosynthesis of several lanthipeptides and their derivatives that are under clinical evaluation such as actagardine and duramycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grasemann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Steiner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones and Helm, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oliynyk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crowther et al., 2013</xref>). As such, structural information on this class of synthetases will also facilitate bioengineering of improved analogs. We describe here the 2.2 Å resolution structure of CylM and demonstrate that its dehydration domain surprisingly has structural similarity with eukaryotic lipid kinases despite the absence of notable sequence homology. These findings may also have implications for the three eukaryotic homologs of lanthipeptide cyclases, one of which was recently shown to interact with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zeng et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure and in vitro activity of CylM</title><p>CylM and its substrate peptides CylL<sub>L</sub> and CylL<sub>S</sub> were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as hexahistidine-tagged proteins and purified by metal affinity chromatography. Incubation of CylM with CylL<sub>L</sub> or CylL<sub>S</sub> in the presence of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and subsequent removal of the leader peptides by purified CylA, a serine protease of the cytolysin biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Booth et al., 1996</xref>), resulted in the desired number of dehydrations as determined by matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis of the peptides by tandem electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS) demonstrated the formation of the correct ring structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the mechanism of catalysis, we determined the 2.2 Å resolution structure of CylM in complex with adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The structure of the ∼110 kDa polypeptide consists of two distinct domains, with an N-terminal dehydration domain, composed of residues Asn4 through Pro624, and a C-terminal cyclization domain encompassed by Tyr641 through Glu992 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The protein is a monomer in the crystal and in solution as determined by gel filtration analysis. Consistent with prior predictions, the cyclization domain consists of the α/α-barrel fold observed in the structure of the stand-alone class I Lan cyclase NisC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2006</xref>). As in NisC, CylM contains a single zinc ion near the center of the toroid coordinated by residues Cys875, Cys911, and His912, with a water molecule completing the tetrahedral coordination geometry at the metal. This zinc site is believed to activate the thiols of the Cys residues during the cyclization reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2006</xref>). The barrel of the NisC structure is interspersed with a structural element that resembles eukaryotic peptide-binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which is thought to bind the leader region of the substrate peptide. The C-terminal cyclization domain of CylM lacks this element but instead contains a β-sheet region composed of three antiparallel strands that is situated near the zinc ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, red). This element, encompassing Ile666 through Leu690, is located on the opposite face of the toroid relative to the putative leader peptide-binding domain in NisC, where it flanks against the base of the N-terminal dehydration domain of CylM. A similar antiparallel β-stranded element engages the leader peptide in the mechanistically unrelated class I Lan dehydratase NisB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ortega et al., 2015</xref>) and is also found in other enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koehnke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkhart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koehnke et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, the leader peptide binding architecture may be conserved across RiPP biosynthetic enzymes, despite very high diversity of the reactions they catalyze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnison et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate whether the β-stranded element in the cyclase domain is important for the dehydration reaction, the N-terminal domain (residues 1–625) that lacks this element was expressed and purified with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag. Incubation with CylL<sub>S</sub> substrate resulted in efficient dehydration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the β-stranded element is not required for the dehydration reaction. This observation is consistent with several very recent reports describing expression and activity of the two individual domains of various LanM enzymes and binding of their substrates to both domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shimafuji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2015</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07607.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall structure of CylM.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>) Structure of the class I lanthipeptide cyclase NisC illustrating the structural homology with the C-terminus of CylM.

The CylM C-lobe is appended with two helices formed by Gln589 through Pro624 that are characteristic of lipid kinases (helices kα10 and kα11 in lipid kinase nomenclature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sibanda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).

Kinase activity is typically controlled through activation-induced conformational changes, consisting of a disorder-to-order transition of the activation loop, which aligns active site residues and provides part of the binding site for substrate. Unlike most kinases, the activation loop in the CylM dehydration domain, composed of residues Asn365 through Val383, is well defined in the absence of bound peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2A, 3A</xref>). The orientation and stabilization of the activation loop is established through numerous interactions with the LanM-specific KA domain, which is itself held in place through interactions with the ‘capping helices’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2A, 3A</xref>). The activation loop is presumably stabilized in a catalytically competent conformation, because unlike most lipid kinases, the dehydration activity of LanM enzymes is not dependent on exogenous regulatory protein activators. The activation loop in mTOR is similarly held in a catalytically competent conformation via interactions with a highly conserved and integral ∼35 residue FATC domain, which is stabilized through packing interactions with a ∼40 residue insertion in the C-lobe termed the LBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Substrate binding sites in CylM</title><p>In the CylM co–crystal structure, the bound AMP is located between the two lobes of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) is composed of residues Ser247 through Thr262 and is considerably longer than the equivalent feature in PI3Ks. It contains many residues that are poised to interact with the nucleotide phosphate, including Asp252 and His254. Mutational analysis suggests a second role for these residues in the elimination of phosphate from the phosphorylated peptide product (see below). The adenine is situated in a hydrophobic binding pocket common across other structurally characterized kinases that is defined by CylM residues Val272 (Ile831 in PI3Kγ), Val301 (Tyr867 in PI3Kγ), Ile354 (Met953 in PI3Kγ), and Val361 (Phe961 in PI3Kγ). The proposed mechanism for PIKKs involves a conserved DxH motif, and LanM-conserved residues Asp347 and His349 are poised for catalysis in CylM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). His349 may receive a proton from Ser/Thr in the substrate peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2010</xref>), in which case Asp347 likely orients the Ser/Thr oxygen for nucleophilic attack onto the γ-phosphate of ATP. Alternatively, Asp347 could accept the proton from substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). The invariant Lys residue that activates the γ-phosphate in kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanks and Hunter, 1995</xref>) is Lys274 in CylM. Additionally, two conserved residues, Asn352 and Asp364, are situated to act as divalent metal ligands to stabilize the incipient charge in the transition state, although slight reorientation of the side chain conformations must occur upon binding of the metal. A superposition of CylM with recent structures of the cyclin-dependent PIKK CDK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2011</xref>) and mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), each bound to transition state mimics, reveals a near-perfect coincidence of equivalent residues at the active site, underscoring their importance in catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The structure also suggests a model for how the substrate peptide can bind to the two active sites. A superposition of CylM with the CDK2-substrate peptide bound structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2011</xref>) reveals that the LanM-specific KA domain occludes the canonical peptide binding sites of protein and lipid kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Instead, a solvent-excluded surface diagram demarcates a groove that leads to the nucleotide-binding site of the dehydratase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). A second groove traces to the zinc ion in the cyclase domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Rate of ATP consumption in the presence of substrate peptide</title><p>In order to establish the functional relevance of the observed structural similarities between CylM and lipid kinases, we measured the kinetics for ATP hydrolysis by CylM in the presence of the substrate peptide CylL<sub>S</sub>.

Previous mutagenesis studies identified four conserved residues in LanMs that are important for the phosphate elimination reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">You and van der Donk, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). Inspection of the CylM structure shows that these four residues (Asp252, His254, Arg506, and Thr512) are in close proximity to each other despite a separation of &gt;250 amino acids in primary sequence, and that they are situated in or immediately adjacent to the phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Their importance was investigated using alanine substitution. Phosphorylated intermediates were detected for all four mutants, with partially dehydrated products observed for all except CylM-T512A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 1, 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data SD3-data">Figure 5—source data 1–3</xref>). Thus, all four residues are important for phosphate elimination. Asp252 and His254 are in the P-loop, which is thought to activate NTPs for attack during hydrolysis or substrate phosphorylation by interacting with the γ-phosphate. The mutant phenotypes suggest that these residues may play a similar role of phosphate stabilization during the phosphate elimination reaction. Arg506 and Thr512 are located within the KA domain, suggesting that, in addition to stabilizing the activation loop, this domain also provides residues to assist in the elimination of phosphate. CylM thus offers insights into how an existing fold for an enzymatic activity (phosphorylation) can be adopted to carry out a second activity (elimination).</p><p>The mechanism to achieve dehydration in CylM is decidedly different from that found in other lanthipeptide synthetases. In class I, the Ser and Thr side chain hydroxyl groups are activated by glutamylation in a glutamyl-tRNA-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ortega et al., 2015</xref>). Class III and IV lanthipeptide synthetases are made up of separate Ser/Thr protein kinase, phosphoSer/phosphoThr elimination, and cyclase domains that are readily recognized by sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goto et al., 2010</xref>). The distinct phosphorylation and elimination domains in these latter enzymes require the phosphorylated peptides to translocate from the kinase to the lyase active site, accounting for the observation of phosphorylated intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jungmann et al., 2014</xref>). The adjacency of the phosphorylation and elimination active sites in CylM provides an explanation for the lack of observed phosphorylated substrate peptides as intermediates in LanM catalysis if elimination occurs faster than peptide dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thibodeaux et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the elimination step, a mixture of phosphorylated CylL<sub>S</sub> peptides carrying different numbers of phosphate esters was obtained by co-expression of CylL<sub>S</sub> with the elimination-deficient CylM-R506A mutant in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The purified phosphorylated peptides were then incubated with wild-type CylM. Without addition of nucleotides, CylM did not eliminate the phosphates. However, when ADP or ADP analogs were supplied, the phosphorylated peptides were converted to dehydrated CylL<sub>S</sub> peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>). Collectively, our results are consistent with an ordered kinetic mechanism in which ADP needs to bind before the phosphorylated peptide or in which the presence of ADP within the active site increases the affinity for phosphorylated peptide intermediates. The results are also consistent with processive phosphorylation and elimination steps since ADP present in the active site from the phosphorylation reaction is required for the phosphate elimination reaction.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07607.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>MALDI-TOF mass spectra of phosphorylated CylL<sub>S</sub> intermediates incubated with CylM in the absence of nucleotides (black trace), and in the presence of AMP (adenosine 5′-monophosphate disodium salt) (blue trace), non-hydrolyzable ADP (adenosine 5′-(β-thio)diphosphate trilithium salt) (magenta trace), or non-hydrolyzable ATP (adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate lithium salt hydrate) (red trace).</title><p>M = unmodified CylLs; P = phosphorylation.

LanC proteins are stand-alone Lan cyclases such as NisC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Both LanCL1 and LanCL2 bind glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2007</xref>), with the thiol of glutathione coordinating the conserved zinc site in LanCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, the human proteins also appear to activate a thiol, like the LanC proteins and the homologous C-terminal domains of the bacterial LanM enzymes. Although the precise functions of LanCL proteins are currently still unresolved, human LanCL1 has been shown to be important for antioxidant activity that is key to neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies indicated regulation of and physical interactions between the human LanCL2 and the kinases Akt and mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zeng et al., 2014</xref>). The structure of CylM shows that its LanC domain interacts with the activation loop and the kα11 helix of the kinase domain. These observations provide a platform to further investigate the intermolecular interaction of LanCL proteins with mammalian kinases, such as mTOR, that have structural homology with the CylM kinase domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The structural and biochemical analysis of the lanthipeptide synthetase CylM provided here presents the first molecular picture for installation of the thioether crosslinks in the large family of class II lanthipeptides. Leader-dependent binding of the substrate would template movement of the core peptide between the dehydration and cyclization domains. The immediacy of the phosphorylation and phosphate-elimination sites allows for both reactions to occur in a processive manner to yield the dehydroamino residue, which can then be consigned to the cyclization domain for subsequent Michael-type addition reaction. The ordered activation loop in CylM precludes the need for an activation-induced conformational change, observed for other lipid kinases, as binding of the substrate is dictated largely by the leader sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thibodeaux et al., 2015</xref>).

Cell pellets were harvested from the cultures by centrifugation at 4°C, followed by suspension of the pellet in ∼30 ml of buffer (500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0). Frozen cell pellets were thawed and lysed by sonication, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4°C. The clear supernatant containing the soluble fraction was loaded onto a 5 ml immobilized metal ion affinity resin column (Hi-Trap Ni-NTA, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer (1 M NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0). The column was washed with 50 ml of 12% elution buffer (1 M NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0), and eluted by a linear gradient. Fractions containing the highest purity protein, as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE, were pooled and further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex Hiload 200 16/60, GE Healthcare) in 500 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 buffer. The purified protein was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filters (10 KDa molecular weight cut-off, Millipore) and stored in liquid nitrogen until needed. The final concentration was quantified by Bradford analysis (Thermo Scientific).</p><p>Crystals of LanM were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion method, by mixing 1 μl of protein (concentration of 2–6 mg/ml) with an equal volume of precipitant of either 0.2 M CaCl, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM betaine hydrochloride, and 28% PEG 400 (condition 1) or 0.2 M KCl, 0.05 M HEPES pH7.5, 10 mM barium chloride, and 33% 5/4 PO/OH (condition 2). Crystals were supplemented with either PEG 400 or 5/4 PO/OH to a final concentration of 35% (vol/vol) prior to vitrification by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen. Macro- and micro-seeding facilitated the formation of crystals suitable for diffraction data collection. SeMet CylM was expressed, purified, and crystallized in a similar manner. Native and SeMet data were collected at Sector 21 ID (LS-CAT, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Labs, IL) and data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Otwinowski et al., 2003</xref>) or XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kabsch, 2014</xref>). Crystallographic phases were determined by single wavelength anomalous diffraction methods from data collected on crystals of SeMet CylM to a resolution limit of 2.7 Å. Heavy atom sites were located using the SHELX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheldrick, 2010</xref>) suite of programs and refinement of heavy atom parameters in SHARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bricogne et al., 2003</xref>) yielded an initial figure of merit of 0.273. Multiple rounds of automated and manual model building using COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>), interspersed with rounds of crystallographic refinement using REFMAC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murshudov et al., 2011</xref>), resulted in convergence to the near final model (free R factor of 0.30). Ligand and water molecules were added at this stage and refinement was completed using BUSTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanc et al., 2004</xref>). The validity of all models was routinely determined using MOLPROBITY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) and by using the free R factor to monitor improvements during building and crystallographic refinement.

Mixtures of 50 µl of ATP (800 µM) and ADP were made in which the final ADP content varied from 0 to 20% (0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 80, and 160 μM), which represents the percent conversion of ATP to ADP in the kinetic experiments. These standard solutions were designated the 800 μM series. Mixtures in a 400 µM series were prepared by diluting 25 µl of the 800 µM series samples with 25 µl 1× reaction buffer. Similarly, 200, 100, 50, and 25 µM series (25 µl each) were prepared. To each sample, 25 µl of the ADP-Glo Reagent was added and incubated for 40 min, followed by the addition of 50 µl of ADP-Glo Max Detection Reagent and incubation for 1 hr. All samples were then transferred into a white 96 well plate and the luminescence was measured by a plate reader. Standard curves (25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 µM series) were created to correlate the ADP concentration with the luminescence.</p><p>To measure the ATP consumption of CylM in vitro, 25 µl of reaction mixtures were prepared consisting of 100 µM linear peptide, 1 µM CylM, and 1× reaction buffer, followed by the addition of ATP to final concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 µM. Control reactions were set up with all other components in the absence of CylM. Reactions were incubated at 25°C for 1, 2, 3, and 4 min before being stopped by adding 25 µl of ADP-Glo Reagent, which depletes the remaining ATP. After incubation for 40 min, ADP-Glo Max Detection Reagent (50 µl) was then added, the samples were incubated for 1 hr, and the luminescence was measured. ADP production in each sample was calculated by applying the corresponding standard curve. The curve of ATP consumption of CylM against ATP concentration was fitted using OriginPro 2015. All reactions were carried out in duplicate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01 GM058822 to WAvdD and RO1 GM079038 to SKN).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Two reviewers have read your manuscript and they both found its findings to be interesting and significant. The reviewers have also provided some useful comments for you to consider during revision. Specifically, they struggled to visualize the structural relatedness between CylM and lipid kinases as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. It therefore seems important for you to improve this section of the manuscript and its presentation. In complementary ways, both reviewers also raised concerns about whether CylM truly exhibits kinase-like activities that would support the claim that structural homology implies functional homology. The reviewers have suggested some specific experiments to address this point, as well as to test whether the role of ADP in the CylM mechanism might be more than just structural. Hopefully, you can perform these additional experiments to more directly evaluate the kinase-like functions of CylM and the potential role of the ADP product in the second phosphate elimination step. Some of the specific comments of the reviewers are included below.</p><p>Summary of reviews:</p><p>The article by Dong et al. reveals the first structural information on a LanM lanthipeptide synthetase. The authors reveal that the enzyme contains a dehydratase domain that shares homology with lipid kinases. The authors provide a strong rationale for how the enzyme carries out a concerted phosphorylation, and elimination reaction. The van der Donk laboratory has a strong background in the study of these enzymes, and this structural work provides a strong underpinning to much of both theirs and others’ work in the field. The work is overall of high quality. However, there are a few points that need to be addressed before the work is ready for publication.</p><p>Important revisions:</p><p>1) The authors do not show in the work the rates of ATP and peptide substrate turnover by the enzyme, and it would be interesting to see how effective this enzyme is compared to other protein and lipid kinases. The authors note that the activation loop appears to be maintained in an ordered active conformation.

We confirmed that CylM exhibits kinase-like activities with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value of 99 µM for ATP and an apparent k<sub>cat</sub> of 4.08 min<sup>‒1</sup>. The solubility of the substrate does not allow determination of its kinetic constants, but the kinetic parameters varying the ATP concentration are of the same magnitude of what were reported for the kinase domain of mTOR in the presence of the 4EBP1 peptide substrate. We felt that that was the best kinase for comparison since it is a lipid kinase-like enzyme but its substrates are proteins/peptides (like CylM).</p><p>We believe these new data and the additional paragraph we added into the manuscript provides the reader with an idea regarding the overall kinetics of the kinase activity of CylM. Of course, the enzyme catalyzes more than just the phosphorylation (also elimination and cyclization) and it does so at multiple sites on its substrate. Hence, a detailed comparison with dedicated protein kinases is not readily accomplished. Nevertheless, the ordered loop observed in CylM does not seem to accelerate ATP hydrolysis significantly with this particular set up. We appreciate the suggestion of performing such an experiment.</p><p><italic>2) The authors show detailed structural comparisons between CylM and PI3Kγ in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>.

In short, we discovered that CylM can use both ATP and ADP to phosphorylate its substrates, although ATP is preferred over ADP. However, the use of ADP for phosphorylation presented a problem when we were trying to isolate just the elimination reaction.</p><p>The substrates used for the latter activity was a mixture of CylL<sub>S</sub> peptides that carry different numbers of phosphate esters. When ADP was used to investigate the ability to eliminate the phosphates (as we described, no elimination is observed in the absence of nucleotides) elimination was observed, but the number of net dehydrations exceeded the number of initial phosphorylations. This is because new phosphorylations and eliminations were catalyzed by CylM in the presence of ADP. This unexpected observation complicated the outcome and made data interpretation difficult. For example, when ADP was supplied instead of non-hydrolyzable ADP using a similar set up, only fully dehydrated CylL<sub>S</sub> could be observed after incubation. We added new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref> to illustrate this. Therefore, to study the elimination reaction in isolation, non-hydrolyzable ATP and ADP analogues were employed to minimize the effect resulted from CylM-catalyzed phosphorylation.</p><p><italic>Minor points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The discussion of LanC at the end of the Discussion seems to be premature.

We also removed the speculation about possible evolutionary origins and removed the statement that the CylM structure may be a preview of the interactions of mammalian LanCL proteins with kinases. We did leave in a discussion of the previously observed interaction between mTORC1 and LanCL1, since it was found well before the structure of CylM was determined. We believe that the CylM structure does provide a potential platform to use for investigation of the mTOR-LanCL2 interaction and that pointing this out is useful for the pertinent community who may not necessarily recognize the relevance of a LanM structure.</p><p><italic>2) The authors have carried out very detailed analysis of substrates and phosphate ester analogs for both the wild type and mutant enzymes.
