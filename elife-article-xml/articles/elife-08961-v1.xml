significance. Site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking were used to probe the architecture of oligomers formed by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Hsp70, BiP. These were found to consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another, attenuating the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly-modulated reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified BiP. Lumenal ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding, pointing to the relative inertness of the oligomers. Thus, equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric BiP is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale attainable neither by inter-conversion of active and covalently-modified BiP nor by the conventional unfolded protein response.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08961.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08961.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08961.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are composed of long chains of amino acids that fold on themselves to form three-dimensional structures. Many proteins are made in a compartment within the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum and ‘chaperone’ proteins help them fold correctly. Cells carefully regulate the levels of chaperone proteins. If there are too few chaperones in the cell, then newly-made proteins may fold incorrectly and interrupt other processes. On the other hand, if too many chaperones are present they may slow down the protein folding process.</p><p>If a cell experiences stressful conditions, or if there is a sudden demand for more proteins to be made, protein folding can be disrupted. This leads to an increase in the number of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and so the cell increases the levels of chaperone proteins to cope with this.</p><p>Hsp70 chaperones are one family of chaperone proteins. These proteins can be present in a cell as single molecules (monomers) or as a group of several chaperone molecules (oligomers). Previous research has suggested that the chaperone proteins in oligomers are inactive, but the oligomers may be rapidly broken down into monomers when the cell needs to fold more proteins. A region within the Hsp70 called the ‘interdomain linker’ is important for regulating the chaperone activity, but it is not clear if this is connected to the formation of oligomers.</p><p>Preissler et al. used biochemical techniques to study how an Hsp70 protein in the endoplasmic reticulum called BiP forms oligomers. The experiments show that oligomers form when the interdomain linker of one BiP molecule is bound to the region of an adjacent BiP molecule that is normally reserved for binding to unfolded proteins. The presence of the interdomain linker makes it more difficult for unfolded proteins to bind.</p><p>Further experiments challenged cells with chemicals that caused the number of unfolded proteins in the cells to increase. Under these conditions, there was a decrease in the number of BiP molecules associated with oligomers. Preissler et al. propose that BiP oligomers act as reservoirs to store BiP molecules when they aren't needed by the cell. However, when the levels of unfolded proteins rise, cells can rapidly break up these oligomers to make active monomers that help to deal with the excess numbers of unfolded proteins. Further work is needed to understand how changes in the number of unfolded proteins in cells leads to the formation and disassembly of BiP oligomers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08961.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08961.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>BiP/GRP78</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>oligomerization</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EU FP7 Beta-Bat No: 277713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 084812/Z/08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 100140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>US Public Health Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH-GM54068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harding</surname><given-names>Heather P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interdomain linker-mediated oligomerization of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein BiP responds to the unfolded protein burden</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) processes the vast majority of newly synthesized proteins destined for secretion and membrane insertion. The maturation of ER client proteins entails the chaperone assisted folding of nascent chains and assembly of functional complexes. Protein folding homeostasis in the ER requires that the complement of chaperones match closely the burden of nascent chains: too few chaperones risks misfolding and proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balch et al., 2008</xref>), whereas too many chaperones slow down folding, impede cell growth and incur a cost of excessive client protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dorner et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feder et al., 1992</xref>). The challenge in the ER is especially great, as the compartment experiences wide, physiologically-driven fluctuations in client protein load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Itoh and Okamoto, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Logothetopoulos and Jain, 1980</xref>). But this dynamism also renders the ER a useful window into general principles that maintain protein folding homeostasis.</p><p>The importance of transcriptional regulation of ER chaperone-encoding genes has long been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 1989</xref>) and the signal transduction pathways that couple unfolded protein stress (ER stress) to gene expression—collectively referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR)—have been worked out in some detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). The inherent latency of this transcriptional program has favored the evolution of an additional strand to the UPR whereby, in animal cells, ER stress is coupled to rapid attenuation of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 1999</xref>). Whilst translation attenuation is an effective bulwark against misfolding and proteotoxicity, it caps the biosynthetic yield on ER activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trusina et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The inherent limitations and costs of the conventional transcriptional and translational UPR have generated interest in post-translational adaptations with shorter latency that rapidly match chaperone availability to client protein load. One such adaptation, apparently unique to the ER, is the reversible ADP ribosylation and de-ribosylation of the ER Hsp70 chaperone, BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlsson and Lazarides, 1983</xref>). In its ADP ribosylated form, BiP is locked into an inactive state with low affinity for its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freiden et al., 1992</xref>). ADP ribosylation affects residues in BiP that interfere with the allosteric coupling of ATP binding and hydrolysis in BiP's nucleotide binding domain (NBD) to the affinity of its substrate binding domain (SBD) for unfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>), thus targeting the basic chaperoning mechanism used by all Hsp70/DnaK family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayer and Bukau, 2005</xref>).</p><p>A recent study reveals that the same circumstances that promote ADP ribosylation of BiP are also associated with rapidly reversible formation of an ester bond between threonine 366 in the NBD and adenosine monophosphate to yield BiP AMPylation, an inactivation modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ham et al., 2014</xref>). Whilst the interrelation of ADP ribosylation and AMPylation remain to be worked out, covalently modified BiP is understood to represent an inactive buffer that can be drawn upon in time of need, by removal of the modifications, thereby increasing the capacity of the ER to cope with enhanced unfolded protein burden whilst minimizing the cost of over-chaperoning. Indeed, the inter-conversion of ADP ribosylated and AMPylated BiP to the unmodified active form follows a coherent pattern whereby increased client protein load converts the inactive buffer form to the active one and diminished client protein load pushes modification the other way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laitusis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanyal et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The transitions noted above occur over a time scale of ∼1 hr, allowing for more rapid adaptations. One such potential adaptation entails oligomerization. Oligomerization of BiP, mammalian Hsc70 and bacterial DnaK, has been observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benaroudj et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">King et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schonfeld et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aprile et al., 2013</xref>) and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freiden et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>). The oligomers have attenuated client binding capability and may convert to the more active monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freiden et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chevalier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aprile et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that they may represent a rapidly accessible, inactive buffer form of chaperone. However, the molecular basis for oligomerization has remained obscure.</p><p>In recent years it has become apparent that the highly conserved interdomain linker connecting the NBD and SBD plays a crucial role in allosteric regulation of Hsp70 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kityk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qi et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, the aliphatic side chains of the conserved linker are reversibly buried against the NBD (in the ATP-bound state of the chaperone) or exposed to the solvent (in the ADP-bound state) mediating key allosteric transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertelsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>). Here we report on application of a chemical probe specific to the interdomain linker of BiP and site-specific crosslinking to analyze its disposition in BiP monomers and oligomers. In doing so we have uncovered a mechanism for rapid and reversible BiP oligomerization that inactivates the chaperone to serve as a recoupable storage form.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro BiP oligomerization by cross-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker at <italic>trans</italic> substrate binding sites</title><p>Allosteric coupling between the domains of DnaK/Hsp70-type chaperones is modulated by nucleotide binding to the regulatory NBD. In the ATP-bound state the two domains are in close juxtaposition and the side-chains of the hydrophobic interdomain linker are engaged at the interface of the NBD and SBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Hendrickson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kityk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qi et al., 2013</xref>), whereas in the ADP-bound state the domains are uncoupled and the interdomain linker is exposed to the solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertelsen et al., 2009</xref>). It therefore came as surprise to find that in vitro hydrolysis of the ATP in cell lysates (and its conversion to ADP) left a substantial fraction of BiP protected from digestion by a specific protease (SubA) that cleaves its interdomain linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paton et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08961.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ATP increases sensitivity of BiP to cleavage at its interdomain linker.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot of endogenous BiP in lysates of CHO-K1 cells, following exposure (10 min at 30°C) to the indicated concentration of a bacterial protease (SubA) that selectively cleaves the interdomain linker and separation by SDS-PAGE.

However, similar enhancement of linker exposure was also observed in pure preparations of BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that an intrinsic aspect of BiP's biochemistry affords the linker protection under ATP depletion and enhances its exposure upon ATP repletion.</p><p>DnaK/Hsp70-type chaperones are prone to multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freiden et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benaroudj et al., 1995</xref>), which is enhanced in their ADP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">King et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schonfeld et al., 1995</xref>). Crystal forms of a bacterial DnaK have been observed in which the interdomain linker of one protomer is engaged as a typical substrate by an adjacent protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2008</xref>). Whilst the in vivo relevance of <italic>trans</italic>-protomer linker binding has not been explored, the structure suggests a plausible mechanism by which ATP hydrolysis to ADP, which locks BiP in the high substrate-affinity mode, might protect the interdomain linker from digestion by SubA.</p><p>The architecture of BiP oligomers suggested by the aforementioned observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) makes certain testable predictions in regards to the behavior of mutant forms of BiP. To explore the potential role of linker engagement by the SBD in oligomerization, we compared the oligomeric state of wildtype BiP, expressed in and purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, with BiP<sup>V461F</sup>, a mutation that interferes with substrate engagement at the SBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laufen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petrova et al., 2008</xref>) or a four residue substitution that alters the hydrophobic nature of the interdomain linker (L<sup>414</sup>VLL<sup>417</sup> to A<sup>414</sup>DDA<sup>417</sup>, referred to as BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> henceforth) abolishing the linker's role in allostery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laufen et al., 1999</xref>), disrupting the SubA cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paton et al., 2006</xref>) and altering key residues that render the linker a BiP/Hsp70 substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2008</xref>), all whilst preserving the intrinsic ability of BiP's SBD to bind other substrates. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) of purified wildtype BiP yields three discernable peaks (arbitrarily named I, II and III) with tailing into the high molecular weight region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, black trace), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chevalier et al., 1998</xref>).

Together, these experiments reveal that BiP oligomerization depends on integrity of both the SBD and the hydrophobic character of the interdomain linker and likely involves engagement of one BiP molecule by another as a typical substrate.</p><p>To further explore the architecture of BiP oligomers, we incubated wildtype BiP with trace amounts of a fluorescent, lucifer yellow-labeled BiP substrate peptide HTFPAVL (Pep-LY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marcinowski et al., 2011</xref>) and simultaneously recorded the protein quantity (by monitoring peptide bond absorbance at 230 nm) and fluorescent signal as the complex eluted from the SEC column. Incorporation of peptide as a function of BiP quantity fell progressively with increased complex size. The ratio of fluorescent to quantity signal (R<sup>FLU/A230 nm</sup>), arbitrarily set to 1.00 for peak I, was 0.48 for peak II and 0.26 for peak III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting that peaks I, II and III were constituted of progressively larger BiP oligomers but with no concordant increase in peptide binding capacity. The latter finding is consistent with oligomers arranged such that the SBDs of all but the ultimate protomer are engaged in linker binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Engagement of the interdomain linker from one protomer by the SBD of another could explain the resistance of BiP's interdomain linker to cleavage by SubA in the absence of ATP. In contrast, disruption of this homotypic chaperone:client complex upon exposure to ATP would result in enhanced accessibility of the linker to SubA. To examine this possibility in the context of BiP oligomers, we combined trace amounts of lucifer yellow (LY)-tagged BiP<sup>V461F</sup> (that is unable to engage substrates) with BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> that is resistant to cleavage by SubA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and monitored fluorescence (which reports on the LY-BiP<sup>V461F</sup> tracer) and protein absorbance (which reports on mass, contributed largely by BiP<sup>ADDA</sup>) as the sample eluted from a SEC column. In the presence of BiP<sup>ADDA</sup>, the LY-BiP<sup>V461F</sup> tracer distributed between a lower molecular weight peak I and higher molecular weight peak II consistent with a complex formed between BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> and the LY-BiP<sup>V461F</sup> tracer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The latter was much diminished when BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> was replaced by the compound mutant BiP<sup>ADDA;V461F</sup>, which is unable to engage substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Exposure of the samples to SubA prior to SEC eliminated the fluorescent signal at peak I, replacing it with a later-eluting peak (tentatively labeled ‘CP’, for cleavage product) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, right panels). However, the BiP<sup>ADDA</sup>-dependent fluorescent peak II was notably resistant to SubA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with it arising from a molecule of LY-BiP<sup>V461F</sup> tracer whose (otherwise cleavable) interdomain linker is protected by engagement as a typical substrate by a BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> molecule, itself with an uncleavable linker.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08961.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cross-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker in BiP oligomers protects it against cleavage by SubA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coomassie-stained SDS-gel of wildtype (wt) and ADDA mutant BiP (12 µM) before and after cleavage with SubA (0.25 ng/µl) for 15 min.

Whilst incomplete re-equilibration and inter-conversion amongst oligomeric species likely render this an upper estimate of the affinity of BiP protomers for one another, nonetheless the observations point to considerable stability of the oligomers, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chevalier et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The discrete oligomeric species observed in native gel electrophoresis of wildtype BiP were diminished in BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 3), as predicted from the behavior of this mutant on SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This observation is consistent with low affinity of the SBD for the mutant interdomain linker. However, the crystal structure of the ATP-bound homologous DnaK indicates that side chains of BiP linker residues affected by the ADDA mutation (L414 &amp; L416) are directly involved in ATP-mediated coupling of the SBD and NBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kityk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qi et al., 2013</xref>).

In contrast, exposure of BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> to the protease resulted in rapid, nucleotide-independent appearance of the 44 kDa fragment, confirming that the protein was indeed unable to adopt a domain-coupled conformation.</p><p>Next we compared oligomerization of the BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> with other BiP proteins carrying mutations known to favor uncoupling of the SBD and NBD. Both the BiP<sup>T37G</sup> and BiP<sup>G226D</sup> mutations that cannot attain the ATP-induced coupled conformation ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wei et al., 1995</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) promoted oligomerization, in sharp contrast to BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As predicted, the oligomers formed by the BiP<sup>T37G</sup> and BiP<sup>G226D</sup> mutants were unaffected by ATP, in contrast to wildtype BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), confirming their mutant status. The resistance of oligomers formed by the BiP<sup>T37G</sup> and BiP<sup>G226D</sup> mutants to dissociation by ATP, correlated with protection of the interdomain linker from cleavage by SubA (full-length BiP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), consistent with <italic>trans</italic>-engagement of their interdomain linker as a substrate by their uncoupled SBD. Together, these observations separate the allosteric effects of the ADDA mutation from its effects on oligomerization and support that defective oligomerization of BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> is imposed in <italic>cis</italic>, by altered composition of the mutant interdomain linker. The defect of BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> in the formation of discrete oligomers, though conspicuous, is incomplete. Impaired linker binding likely favors lower affinity interactions that involve other elements of BiP and may partially dissociate during separation by native gel electrophoresis (or SEC). This may explain the diffuse signals observed for BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> on native gels (lanes 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the potential for <italic>trans</italic>-engagement of the interdomain linker in the SBD, we incorporated a non-natural amino acid (<italic>p</italic>-benzoyl-<sub>L</sub>-phenylalanine; pBpa, whose side chain can form UV-induced crosslinks with adjacent carbons) into specific sites of bacterially-expressed BiP<sup>V461F</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and purified the derivatized proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1A,B</xref>). When combined with purified FLAG-tagged wildtype BiP, derivatives decorated with pBpa at positions located in the vicinity of the interdomain linker (L414, L416, L417, L419) resulted in a conspicuous, UV-dependent shift in the mobility of the unmodified FLAG-tagged BiP on denaturing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Its aberrantly fast mobility likely reflects a compact conformation of the dimer. The novel modified BiP binding partner-dependent species stood out against the background of UV-dependent changes in the mobility the FLAG-tagged BiP observed in absence of a pBpa-decorated partner; crosslinks to nucleotide likely contribute to altered mobility of UV-irradiated FLAG-tagged BiP during SDS-PAGE. By contrast, incorporation of pBpa at residues distant from the interdomain linker (R510 and T518) gave rise to a much weaker crosslink signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 12 and 14 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

This process, revealed by monitoring the accessibility of BiP's interdomain linker to a sequence-specific protease, SubA, and by site-specific crosslinking, is conspicuous in preparations of pure proteins in vitro, and in living cells. BiP oligomerization is rapidly tuned to the physiological state of the cell, and given that oligomerization inactivates participating BiP protomers, the oligomeric form is a relatively inactive storage form of the chaperone that is accessible on a short time scale. Our findings are consistent with a model whereby competition between oligomerization and substrate binding buffers the ER against rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load in both directions.</p><p>The interdomain linker of Hsp70 chaperones consists of a short stretch of aliphatic residues, well suited to engage the SBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flynn et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993</xref>). A crystal form of bacterial DnaK with cross-protomer binding of the interdomain linker in the SBD shows the engagement of two highly conserved aliphatic side chains of the linker in hydrophobic sites of the SBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2008</xref>). Given the role of these very same side chains in allosteric coupling between the NBD and SBD, this mode of BiP oligomerization results in removal of the BiP protomers involved from the pool of active chaperones. The proposed architecture of the oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) fits well with our finding of a single peptide binding site available in BiP oligomers formed in vitro, regardless of their size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The model fits the observation that oligomeric forms of Hsp70 are holdases rather than foldases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>), as the only protomer capable of engaging substrate (protomer A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) is allosterically uncoupled by the engagement of its interdomain linker in the SBD of the adjacent protomer. The model also explains the observation that DnaK oligomers formed in vitro are subject to regulation by the nucleotide exchange factor, GrpE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>), as the last protomer (protomer C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) is predicted to retain the capacity to respond allosterically to ATP binding to its NDB, initiating oligomer disassembly.</p><p>Our in vitro experiments provide a crude guide to the stability of BiP oligomers. In the absence of ATP, oligomers appear to be remarkably stable with a dissociation K<sub>1/2max</sub> in the lower micromolar range. In vivo, oligomer assembly and disassembly is likely to be influenced by co-chaperones of the DnaJ family that enhance ATP hydrolysis to promote the high affinity state and exchange factors, such as GRP170 and SIL1, that convert BiP to the low affinity state by exchanging ADP for ATP. These co-factors are likely to have an important role in the kinetics of the inter-conversion of BiP monomers to oligomers and in the competing processes of substrate binding and release. Nonetheless, the high concentration of BiP in the ER (&gt;200 µM, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>]) and the inherent affinity of BiP protomers for one another, are consistent with a model whereby oligomerization and substrate binding compete with each other on a level playing field.</p><p>Exploring the relationship between unfolded protein load and the oligomeric state of Hsp70 chaperones is confounded by powerful feedback that dominates the unfolded protein responses and couples chaperone production to the levels of unfolded protein stress. To explicitly cope with this methodological limitation, we have confined the analysis to the early stages of the perturbations that increase the unfolded protein load in the ER and employed manipulations, such as reduction of disulfide bonds by DTT, that are effective even in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis. Our observations paint a coherent picture whereby enhanced production of unfolded proteins rapidly draws on the pool of inactive, oligomeric BiP to service its growing clientele. Reports of enhanced presence of oligomers in longer-term stressed cells may have reflected the partitioning of excess chaperone produced during the activated UPR (or its cytoplasmic counterpart, the heat shock response) but made redundant following resolution of the insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freiden et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, activation of parallel chaperones, such as the oxidative stress induced Hsp33 of bacteria, may account for regulated redundancy of the Hsp70/DnaK system, favoring oligomerization through linker engagement in the course of certain stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winter and Jakob, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The ER is unusual in possessing alternative mechanisms for inactivating its Hsp70 protein, BiP, by covalent modification (ADP ribosylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freiden et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laitusis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>) and AMPylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ham et al., 2014</xref>). The modified form of BiP appears to equilibrate with the active pool more slowly than the oligomers. Together, our observations suggest a hierarchical post-translational mechanism for maintaining balance between chaperones and their clients in the highly dynamic ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). The first line of buffering consists of oligomer formation, as the balance between chaperones and clients tips in favor of the former, and oligomer dissolution, as the balance tips the other way. Conversion of BiP to the modified, inactive form proceeds on a longer time scale. Its precise relationship to oligomerization is unclear, as both the unemployed monomer and inactive oligomer, could, in theory, serve as substrates for the modification(s). Either way it seems likely that the physiological impact of both oligomerization and modification is to enable the cell to avoid the cost of over-chaperoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dorner et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feder et al., 1992</xref>) without having to degrade surplus BiP as stress is resolved and to provide cells with an inactive reserve of BiP to draw upon as stress mounts, without resorting to activation of the translational and transcriptional arms of the UPR.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08961.025</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Schema of the proposed relationships between the different forms of BiP.</title><p>The monomer (‘A’ form) at the center of the schema binds clients and is shifted to BiP:Substrate complexes by mounting unfolded protein load.

But oligomerization can serve as an intrinsic mechanism to inactivate excess Hsp70 in other compartments of the eukaryotic cell and indeed across phyla. In that sense oligomerization would appear to be a common primitive strand of the post-translational UPR, recruiting and inactivating Hsp70 chaperones according to need. This simple, mass action-based mechanism for regulating Hsp70 function may exist alongside other mechanisms, such as oxidation-induced domain unfolding, which may promote alternative modes of oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Winter et al., 2005</xref>). Such alternative modes may account for the heterogeneity of DnaK oligomers observed by single particle electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The inverse correlation between unfolded protein burden and BiP oligomerization appears to break down in the context of ER calcium depletion, which is both a strong inducer of the UPR and promotes rapid oligomerization of BiP. This apparent paradox needs to be considered in the context of observations that BiP oligomerization upon calcium depletion also correlates with less substrate binding (a feature first noted many years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al., 1991</xref>] and confirmed here) and with the observation that calcium depletion-mediated oligomerization slowly draws on the modified, inactive pool of BiP. From BiP's perspective, oligomerization appears to be the primary event triggered by ER calcium efflux. This depletes the pool of active chaperones and disrupts, by mass action, chaperone-client interactions, releasing clients that would otherwise have remained bound to BiP. The ensuing, slower loss of the modified form of BiP is consistent with equilibrium between the modified form and the monomer and its latency is consistent with the need for enzymes to remove the modifications.</p><p>We do not understand how calcium depletion shifts the equilibrium in favor of the oligomer. In vitro, there is no measureable effect of calcium on BiP oligomerization, in either the ATP state or ADP state or in the presence of the J-factor ERdj3 or the exchange factor GRP170 (not shown), yet in vivo, ER calcium depletion promotes such oligomerization. This discrepancy could be resolved by an ER-localized J-factor whose affinity for BiP as a substrate is increased selectively as (Ca<sup>+2</sup>)<sub>ER</sub> declines. Given that the affinity of Hsp70 proteins for their substrates is governed by J-protein driven non-equilibrium mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014</xref>), such a scenario could account for BiP favoring itself as a client (oligomerizing) over other clients, as (Ca<sup>+2</sup>)<sub>ER</sub> declines. Regardless of mechanism, one consequence of (Ca<sup>+2</sup>)<sub>ER</sub> depletion-mediated BiP oligomerization would be to also shift the equilibrium between unfolded proteins and active chaperones in favor of the former. Furthermore, given the 1:1 stoichiometry of the repressive complex formed between BiP and the lumenal, stress-sensing domains of the UPR transducers PERK and IRE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>), it seems likely that the monomer serves as a UPR repressor. Thus, (Ca<sup>+2</sup>)<sub>ER</sub> depletion-mediated oligomerization of BiP stands to contribute to UPR activation by increasing the burden of free unfolded proteins and by lowering the availability of monomeric BiP to repress the stress transducers.</p><p>Calcium depletion-mediated oligomerization of BiP is observed in physiological circumstances, as a consequence of engagement of cell surface receptors by activating ligands that couple to store release channels. We do not know if oligomerization of BiP and its downstream consequences are a feature that promotes fitness (i.e. a feature that has been positively selected during eukaryote evolution) or simply a reflection of limitations in the functionality of an organelle that experiences fluctuations in the concentration of calcium, imposed by other exigencies, such as the benefits of signaling in the cytosol by the released calcium. However, it is tempting to speculate that the transient excursions of UPR signaling imposed by BiP oligomerization may have some benefit. In secretory cells, such a scheme would couple signals that promote granule secretion to transient translational repression (attendant upon PERK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 1999</xref>]). This may have short-term benefits in terms of diverting resources away from translation to the bio-energetically costly process of secretion. Transient activation of UPR transducers also results in elaboration of downstream effectors. These transcription factors, XBP1, ATF6 and ATF4, adapt cells to their secretory mission by promoting the latent process of ER biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sriburi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2005</xref>), and by expanding the capacity to translate mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harding et al., 2003</xref>). It is thus tempting to speculate that calcium depletion-mediated BiP oligomerization contributes to transient activation of the UPR observed in secretory cells responding to secretagogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubisch and Logsdon, 2007</xref>) and thereby promotes long-term coupling of the capacity to produce and process precursors of secretory proteins to the short-term demand for the secreted end product.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> lists the plasmids used, their lab names, description and notes their first appearance in the figures and the corresponding label, and provides a past reference, where available.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein purification</title><p>Wildtype and mutant versions of N-terminally hexahistidine- (His6-) tagged hamster BiP (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and ‘Plasmid construction’) were encoded on pQE10 plasmids (Qiagen UK, Manchester, United Kingdom) and expressed in M15 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (Qiagen) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>).

Your full submission has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor), Peter Walter (Guest Reviewing editor), and three peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. We would like to encourage you, however, to submit a substantially refocused manuscript as described below, which if you chose to do so would be subject to a new round of review.</p><p>As you will see below, while the level of enthusiasm of the reviewers varied, all agreed that the experiments are cleverly designed and executed, and that the underlying hypothesis is an attractive and important one. In the current manuscript the mechanistic studies in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3">Figures 1-3</xref>) carry the weight of the conclusions, and the in vivo work complements largely by being consistent with the hypothesis. It is the importance to the chaperone/protein folding field of the linker-mediated oligomerization that can lift this paper to <italic>eLife</italic> standards, especially if more direct evidence of that interaction could be included.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors analyze oligomerization of Bip in vitro and in vivo. Using bacterial protease SubA, specific for the interdomain linker, the authors explore the role of this domain in oligomerization of Bip. Adding SubA to CHOK1 lysates in the presence of ATP increased its susceptibility to interdomain cleavage and depolymerization. Gel exclusion chromatography using purified WT Bip and mutants of SBD and linker domains further established the role for the substrate binding domain (SBD) and interdomain in oligomerization. This confirmed previous observations on ATP mediated Bip depolymerization and suggest a role for the interdomain in this process. The authors then go on to other experiments to analyze the arrangement of protomers in the Bip oligomer. Through analysis of combinations of SBD mutant (V461F), interdomain mutant (ADDA) and double mutant (ADDA-V461F) either purified or transfected into cells followed by gel filtration and native gel electrophoresis. The authors suggest <italic>trans</italic>-protomer engagement of the interdomain with the SBD as the mechanism of Bip oligomerization in vitro and in vivo that is independent of the helical lid. Induction of protein misfolding by most methods (dithiothreitol (DTT), cycloheximide (CHX), activation of Fv2E-PERK, tunicamycin {trade mark, serif} etc) induced depolymerization of Bip possibly to make it available to bind to unfolded proteins. However, it was observed that ER calcium depletion promoted appearance of oligomers by promoting dissociation from its substrates but the cellular function/significance for this shift in equilibrium is unknown.</p><p>Overall:</p><p>The major point of this paper is a model proposed for Bip oligomerization by a trans-protomer engagement of one SBD with the interdomain of the adjacent protomer. It is still not clear that one can convincingly conclude this model based on the results presented here. The data are interpreted as being consistent with previous findings/models but alternative explanations are possible and not considered. For example, in the subsection “In vitro BiP oligomerization by cross-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker at <italic>trans</italic> substrate binding sites” it is stated that “Importantly, addition of ATP has no effect on migration of the ADDA mutant, consistent with abolition of allosteric coupling between the domains...”. It is difficult to make these conclusions from studying a single mutant protein. One experiment to support the <italic>trans</italic>-protomer engagement rather than a burying effect of the interdomain in the presence of ATP would be to directly show interaction of the interdomain with the SBD. The findings are consistent with crystal structures of a DnaK family member and biophysical analyses showing the interdomain linker binds the SBD of an adjacent protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aprile et al., 2013</xref>). These latter studies are much more thorough and definitive than the present analysis.</p><p>Overall, the first three figures are fairly convincing that analyze purified Bip in vitro, if the authors can further successfully address the following alternative explanations:</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, there is possibility that the ATP/ADP ratio or ADP concentration affects oligomer formation since the ADP-bound form was shown to be a more stable form of Bip.</p><p>The reviewer wonders if the ATP or ATP/ADP ratio affects SubA protease activity? This can be easily checked out using the linker peptide substrates as cleavage readout. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> seems to support this scenario that ATP addition increases Bip cleavage (compare lane 2 and 4).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref>, controls are needed for AMP and ADP, as well as another nucleotide (such as GTP) as negative controls.</p><p>In contrast and unfortunately, the cellular studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7 fig8 fig9 fig10">Figures 4-10</xref>) have many limitations that preclude any significant interpretation. The findings are primarily descriptive and do not significantly extend our mechanistic understanding of Bip oligomerization.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Most of the observations reported in this paper are consistent with many previous results on the HSP70 family members, generally, and on Bip oligomerization, specifically. The amount of new insight is fairly limited and in some cases the data are consistent with the model, but the data do not significantly support the model. For example, the oligomerization of Bip and effect of ATP and peptide binding have previously been described years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freiden et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chevalier et al., 1998</xref>). The latter paper actually used a similar technique, enterokinase sensitivity to cleave the NBD from the SBD and measured the impact of ATP binding and peptide binding on oligomerization which produced very similar conclusions drawn from the present study, although the latter paper was not referenced.</p><p>2) The results primarily rely on sensitivity of wildtype Bip and mutant Bip molecules to the protease SubA. It is unclear what cleavage susceptibility by SubA means. Allosteric changes may preclude cleavage by SubA without changing exposure of the interdomain linker.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>, it is clear that at high concentration, Bip has intrinsic oligomerization propensity regardless of ATP concentration. How would this property affect Bip oligomerization during sudden change in ER ionic strength, such as thapsigargin-mediated Ca2+ depletion?</p><p>4) The results of the findings that show calcium depletion promotes oligomer formation are inconsistent with current notions that calcium is required for chaperone function and protein folding. Thus, calcium depletion should cause more misfolding and deplete oligomers. This discrepancy needs to be clarified to understand the impact of protein misfolding vs. calcium on oligomer formation as proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>. To support the model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, the authors need to show a native gel of Bip oligomer formation as a function of escalating Ca2+ concentrations in vitro.</p><p>5) There are inconsistencies with the data from different experiments that are difficult to explain. Some of these are listed below.</p><p>A) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 1-3 minus ATP; there are a number of intermediates of Bip that may represent Bip binding to endogenous peptide ligands. These are not present with ATP and disappear with SubA cleavage. From all of the experiments it is not clear what fraction of the Bip analyzed is oligomeric vs. bound to peptide ligands of different sizes that would migrate as a heterogeneous background.</p><p>B) From analysis of the gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, in the presence of ATP there seems to be less cleaved products especially at lower concentrations of SubA (0.03, 0,08..) compared to minus ATP. Since this is the basis of the whole assay, please clarify.</p><p>C) It is difficult to know how different mutations in Bip impact overall structure (ADDA; V461F).</p><p>D) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> is missing an important control of ATP alone.</p><p>E) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows a 'B' form that is assumed to be ADP-ribosylated/AMPylated, although this is not directly demonstrated. This is inferred from use of novobiocin to inhibit ADP-ribosylation. Why does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> lane 3 show the 'B' form in the presence of novobiocin and cycloheximide?</p><p>F) The authors conclude that stresses that inhibit protein synthesis eliminate the oligomers and promote formation of the 'B' form. Then the authors study different ER stresses, Tm, DTT, Aze to show that they also cause depletion of the oligomers, but the 'B' form does not appear. These stresses should also induce eIF2a phosphorylation and inhibit protein synthesis. However, analyses of eIF2a-P and protein synthesis were not directly studied. If the oligomers disappear, where do they go? These studies should be performed with and without ATP incubation in vitro prior to gel analysis to dissociate potential Bip ligands.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The anticipated wide fluctuation in client load within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) necessitates systems to maintain folding homeostasis. Given the limitations and costs of transcriptional systems like the UPR to maintain homeostasis, a new focus has been placed on identification of more rapid post-translational adaptations that likely exist to adapt to changes in the ER protein load. This manuscript by Preissler et al. furthers our understanding of post-translational adaptation to changes in ER homoestasis and focuses on the molecular basis of oligomerization of the molecular chaperone BiP. Several prior studies have identified the propensity of Hsp70 s to oligomerize, however this study is one of the few to focus on a molecular basis for oligomerization. The manuscript convincingly presents data supporting a mechanism for <italic>trans-</italic>engagement of BiP protomers to facilitate oligomerization. Using various drug treatments in cells, the authors propose a model for a reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers, and a slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently modified BiP.</p><p>Compelling data for <italic>trans</italic>-engagement of adjacent protomers through the substrate binding site of one protomer and the linker of the second protomer are presented using a variety of in vitro and in vivo methods. Such a mechanism is consistent with a prior structure of Hsp70 protomers engaged in a similar <italic>trans</italic>-engagement. in vivo data suggest physiological trigger(s) exist for oligomerization, which may serve to create a pool of inactive yet readily mobilizable BiP.</p><p>A few minor comments:</p><p>Is the ADDA mutant previously described? In the subsection “In vitro BiP oligomerization by cross-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker at trans substrate binding sites”, the authors describe the mutant as “abolishing the linker's role in allostery, disrupting the SubA cleavage site and linker's ability to serve as a BiP substrate, all whilst preserving the intrinsic ability of BiP's SBD to bind other substrates.” There is no reference given, suggesting that the data supporting these statements are derived from the later experiments of this manuscript. If this is the case, it would help to clarify that this mutant was made with the expectation of these effects that were then confirmed by the authors?</p><p>The main focus of the manuscript is the molecular basis for <italic>trans</italic> oligomerization. However, the authors do attempt to create a larger model depicting the interplay between calcium, covalent modification, monomer, and oligomers. The model as proposed is consistent with the data presented, however is seems a few simple experiments could strengthen the arguments for the transitioning between these species. First, does calcium addition to pure protein prevent oligomerization (or is this perhaps as argued related to a shift in client load in the ER?)? Along the same lines, does calcium depletion impact covalent modification of BiP? Second, do mutants in R470or R492, that prevent ADP-ribosylation, impact oligomerization?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a beautifully written and carefully conceived study of the oligomerization of BiP upon several physiological perturbations that alter the folding status of the ER. The authors' original observation – that the interdomain linker became sequestered from proteolysis concurrent with a shift to a higher molecular weight complex – led them to a model for BiP oligomerization that is based on binding of the linker of one monomer to the substrate-binding cleft of another monomer, to form a concatenated oligomer. The authors carry out a large number of clever experiments to test this model, and all the data they present are consistent with the proposed mode of interaction. The case is therefore persuasive. The other work presented in this paper probes the impact of the folding state of the ER and the calcium content on oligomerization, and all of this work is well-conceived and implemented. The expertise of the senior authors is clearly manifest in the way the experiments are designed and interpreted. The picture that clearly emerges is that oligomerization is part of an interwoven network of regulatory mechanisms to enable the ER to respond to changing folding demands.</p><p>Despite the compelling significance and overall clarity of the work presented, none of the experiments in the paper, even taken with the previous crystal structures of oligomers, provides direct evidence for the interaction between the linker of one molecule and the substrate-binding domain of another, and it is a small but non-zero leap-of-faith to accept that this interaction forms the basis for oligomerization. This is a weakness of this otherwise top-notch paper: And it would seem the authors are equipped to address this question by cross-linking and mass spectrometry experiments. Another improvement of the paper that seems quite do-able is more direct characterization of the state of oligomerization (dimer, trimer, etc). It should be possible to do light glutaraldehyde crosslinking and SDS gel characterization of resulting products to determine what species are present in the SEC peaks and native gel bands.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) I would recommend taking the very helpful schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref> and putting into the text early in the Results section, as part of a little new section “Design of experiments”. Without this, the number of constructs and mutant BiP versions and their role in the experiments becomes a bit daunting for the reader. It wouldn't hurt to show the products expected from each experiment in the figure, and the molecular weights anticipated. The reader would then be prepared for the results in the primary data.</p><p>2) The relationship of the oligomerization story to the ADP ribosylation and AMPylation modifications is a bit murky. In the Discussion, the speculation is interesting. But earlier these modifications are presented and only seem to confuse the story presented.</p><p>3) Results: the wording of the subheading about “Physiological release” of calcium is confusing. Is the Ca level in the ER being depleted?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> legend: a word is missing between &quot;that&quot; and &quot;SubA&quot;.</p><p>5) Experiments with transfection of BiP variants in CHO cells: how substantial is the over-expression of the transfected BiP? And how much will this affect the oligomerization/folding balance? I don't believe these issues were discussed.</p><p>A few additional points came up during the discussion among the reviewers and may be worthy of consideration:</p><p>1) the ADDA mutant seem to form oligomers by size exclusion chromatography in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and native gel electrophoresis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A</xref>. This seems inconsistent with the lack of endogenous BiP interaction with the ADDA mutant shown in lane 5 and 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. This should be explained.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> lane 2, oligomeric states of BiP disappear when modified by ADP ribosylation. The authors do not explain the discrepancy with Freiden et al. who showed that oligomeric forms of BiP harbor the modification. Perhaps more importantly, Hu et al. (PMID: 19808260) indicate that cycloheximide treatment renders BiP insensitive to SubAB cleavage in intact B cells. Yet, work in this manuscript suggests the opposite. These points should be addressed.</p><p>3) The authors indicate that Ca++ depletion was shown earlier to interfere with BiP's ability to engage in substrate binding. If the basis of BiP's oligomerization is through its binding to its linker as a substrate, how can the oligomeric state persist upon Ca++ depletion? The attempt to explain these findings in the manuscript is not clear.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were requested before acceptance, as outlined below.]</p><p>14 July 2015: Thank you for submitting your work entitled “Physiological modulation of BiP activity by <italic>trans</italic>-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker” for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), Peter Walter (Guest Reviewing editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work on BiP oligomerization is the most definitive and well-articulated description of the “binding your own interdomain” model for an Hsp70. While the physiological role of this process remains uncertain, the models proposed provide hypotheses for further work. The quality of the science and the writing are top-notch.</p><p>In this revised manuscript, the authors address previous concerns. Prior reviews focused on two primary limitations: a lack of direct evidence for <italic>trans</italic>-engagement of the BiP linker and an absent discussion of the potential for allosteric effects of the mutants (specifically ADDA) used within the study. The authors now include several experiments that aim to decouple the impact of allosteric mutations from linker disruption. The new data are consistent with the original model and provide new mutants that allow one to ascribe certain features to the linker, and not decoupling. The authors incorporate new experiments making use of the incorporation of non-natural amino acid cross-linkers, with the goal of providing more direct evidence for <italic>trans</italic>-engagement of the linker domain. The authors conclude that only cross-linkers incorporated within the linker can engage (cross-link with) a <italic>trans</italic> wild-type BiP. At face value, these data provide a more direct link for <italic>trans</italic>-linker engagement.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following points need to be considered.</p><p>1) The authors include new data with mutants T37G and G226D and photocrosslinking experiments to prove the role of the interdomain in oligomerization. This still does not help to explain any possible allosteric effects of ADDA mutant itself. Is there a reason why ADDA was not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> to be compared with WT and other mutants side by side?</p><p>2) Since calcium has no effect in vitro, is it possible that what the authors are considering Bip oligomers in vivo are in fact Bip in complex with other endogenous substrates? This possibility needs to be considered.</p><p>3) The authors failed to examine effect of other nucleotides (AMP/ADP/ATPγS/GTP/GDP, etc), invalidating the claim that Bip aggregate formation is dependent on ATP concentration. Quote here, “As the reviewer well knows, ATP and ADP are expedients to shift the monomer oligomer equilibrium.” It is unclear what this statement means regarding the requirement for nucleotide and ATP hydrolysis in the oligomerization. Is the ATPase activity important for oligomer-monomer conversion?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08961.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>24 May 2015: An earlier version of this manuscript was reviewed and though that earlier version was rejected, the reviewers and editors recognized the importance and interest of the problem under study and encouraged us to try and improve the manuscript and, provided we were able address the important limitations of the earlier version, submit an improved manuscript for review.</p><p>The most important limitation of the earlier version was deemed to be the strength of the evidence for the specific architecture of BiP oligomers, which we propose to consist of adjacent BiP protomers engaging each other’s hydrophobic interdomain linker as a typical substrate in their substrate binding domain. Whilst all three reviewers recognized that the evidence provided for such an arrangement of protomers was consistent with the model proposed, it was pointed out that we had failed to adequately rule out allosteric effects of the mutants applied to the study of the problem or to provide direct evidence for engagement of the interdomain linker.</p><p>The revised version of the manuscript contains two entirely new figures that address these issues:</p><p>It was pointed out that the previous version of the manuscript failed to take into account the possibility that the mutant BiPADDA, bearing an altered interdomain linker, is impaired in oligomerization not because the mutations lowered the affinity of the interdomain linker for the substrate binding domain of adjacent protomers, but because disruption of the interdomain linker locked BiP into a configuration that allosterically impaired oligomerization. We recognize the validity of this criticism, as it is known that the interdomain linker is required for Hsp70 chaperones to assume the domain-coupled configuration. New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and its accompanying two supplements confirm that BiPADDA is locked in an uncoupled configuration, as expected. However, other mutations that favor the uncoupled configuration (BiPT37 G and BiPG226D) exhibit enhanced oligomerization, as suggested by our model, whereas BiPADDA exhibits impaired oligomerization. These observations uncouple the allosteric effect of the BiPADDA mutation from its effect on oligomerization.</p><p>To directly examine the engagement of the interdomain linker as a substrate in oligomer formation, we followed the suggestions of reviewer #3 and exploited the system developed by the Schultz lab for genetically incorporating an unnatural crosslinkable amino acid site-specifically into BiP. New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and its supplements shows conspicuous crosslink formation when the zero-length crosslinkable para- benzoyl-L-phenylalanine amino acid was incorporated in place of residues in BiP’s interdomain linker, but not when incorporated at a distance from the interdomain linker. These findings directly implicate the interdomain linker in BiP oligomerization.</p><p>In addition to these key improvements, we have taken onboard other points of critique. These have been addressed by providing additional data (e.g. new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) by rearranging existing data (e.g. new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig12">Figures 1C and 12</xref>) or by editorial changes. A point-by-point list of the critiques and changes made follows.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>, there is possibility that the ATP/ADP ratio or ADP concentration affects oligomer formation since the ADP-bound form was shown to be a more stable form of Bip.</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewer wonders if the ATP or ATP/ADP ratio affects SubA protease activity?

However we are not aware that a short peptide corresponding in sequence to the interdomain linker of BiP would serve as a substrate for SubA and even if it did, and if nucleotide manipulation failed to affect cleavage, this would constitute a weak control experiment as doubt would remain as to whether or not a short peptide could capture a regulatory effect of nucleotide. Furthermore, subtilisin and the related chymotrypsin class of proteases are not known to bind nucleotides or to be influenced by their presence. Thus, whilst it is formally possible that nucleotide concentrations affect some aspect of SubA activity, we interpret the observations presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, whereby ATP depletion promotes BiP<sup>V461F</sup> digestion whilst attenuating the digestion of BiP<sup>WT</sup>, to argue that the effects of nucleotide are, at the very least substrate-specific and more in keeping with action on the substrate than on the protease.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B-D</italic></xref><italic>, controls are needed for AMP and ADP, as well as another nucleotide (such as GTP) as negative controls.</italic></p><p>As the reviewer well knows, ATP and ADP are expedients to shift the monomer oligomer equilibrium. It is unclear to us what specific shortcoming in the interpretability of the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref> would be overcome by the use of other nucleotides as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>Major comments:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Most of the observations reported in this paper are consistent with many previous results on the HSP70 family members, generally, and on Bip oligomerization, specifically. The amount of new insight is fairly limited and in some cases the data are consistent with the model, but the data do not significantly support the model. For example, the oligomerization of Bip and effect of ATP and peptide binding have previously been described years ago (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19"><italic>Freiden et al., 1992</italic></xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"><italic>Chevalier et al., 1998</italic></xref><italic>). The latter paper actually used a similar technique, enterokinase sensitivity to cleave the NBD from the SBD and measured the impact of ATP binding and peptide binding on oligomerization which produced very similar conclusions drawn from the present study, although the latter paper was not referenced.</italic></p><p>We readily concede our observations to be consistent with those previously made by others. However, we believe that the critical point of our manuscript: That BiP oligomerization proceeds by trans-linker engagement and the exposition of the consequence of this architecture of the oligomers to their functional state, is a worthy novelty.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to the Chevalier paper, which is now cited prominently. We believe the parallels between the use of enterokinase by Chavalier and colleagues and our application of SubA to be non-redundant. In that Chavalier engineered an enterokinase site into an exposed loop at the C-term of BiP’s NBD to separate the NBD and SBD, not to probe the disposition of the interdomain linker.</p><p><italic>2) The results primarily rely on sensitivity of wildtype Bip and mutant Bip molecules to the protease SubA. It is unclear what cleavage susceptibility by SubA means. Allosteric changes may preclude cleavage by SubA without changing exposure of the interdomain linker.</italic></p><p>We recognize the validity of this point and thank the reviewer for this critique. In response, we have examined in detail other mutations that mimic the allosteric effects of the BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> (to lock BiP in the domain uncoupled configuration) and found that unlike the BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> mutation, which interferes with oligomerisation, these domain-uncoupling mutations (BiP<sup>T37G</sup> and BiP<sup>G226D</sup>) are more prone to oligomerization (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and its supplements).</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</italic></xref><italic>, it is clear that at high concentration, Bip has intrinsic oligomerization propensity regardless of ATP concentration.

The process is tuned by the presence of nucleotide with the ATP-bound state disfavoring oligomerization.</p><p>In vitro, there is no measureable effect of calcium on BiP oligomerization, in either the ATP state or ADP state or in the presence of the J-protein ERdj3 or the exchange factor GRP170 (not shown). In vivo, ER calcium depletion promotes such oligomerization. There are many possible ways in which this could come about. We humor ourselves with the idea that it could, for example, be promoted by a yet-to-be discovered ER-localized J-factor whose affinity for BiP as a substrate is increased selectively as [Ca<sup>+2</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> declines. Given that the affinity of Hsp70 proteins for their substrates is governed by J-protein driven non-equilibrium mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014</xref>), such a scenario could account for BiP favoring itself as a client (oligomerizing) over other clients, as [Ca<sup>+2</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> declines. For now, however, we must set aside these pleasing and plausible (to us) speculations and accept that this is an unresolved mystery. In this study [Ca<sup>+2</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> depletion-mediated BiP oligomerisation is exploited merely to examine the consequences of in vivo modulation of the oligomeric status of BiP. We thank the reviewer for highlighting the need to address these considerations, which we have done in paragraph 8 of the revised Discussion.</p><p>The reviewer states that: “calcium depletion should cause more misfolding and deplete oligomers”. This assumes that misfolding is a proximal consequence of calcium depletion; could it be that formation of BiP oligomers under conditions of calcium depletion contributes to the unfolded protein load in the calcium-depleted ER by competing for client protein binding? This idea is consistent with early observations made by the Klausner lab (and reproduced here, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) in which ER calcium depletion promoted dissociation of complexes between BiP and a sentinel client (an unassembled subunit of the T-cell receptor, in that case, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al., 1991</xref>). We readily concede that we have not proven that calcium depletion mediated oligomerization is the basis for the enhanced presence of misfolded proteins and the activation of the UPR in cells treated with thapsigargin, A23187 etc. And we readily accept that there may be circumstances (specific cell types with specific complement of clients and chaperones) in which calcium depletion has other deleterious effects on the protein folding environment in the ER. But we humbly suggest that our observations favor and alternative mechanism and are reason to re-examine long held views, such as those that impel the reviewer to favor a particular chain of causality.</p><p><italic>5) There are inconsistencies with the data from different experiments that are difficult to explain. Some of these are listed below.</italic></p><p><italic>A) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref><italic>, lanes 1-3 minus ATP; there are a number of intermediates of Bip that may represent Bip binding to endogenous peptide ligands. These are not present with ATP and disappear with SubA cleavage. From all of the experiments it is not clear what fraction of the Bip analyzed is oligomeric vs. bound to peptide ligands of different sizes that would migrate as a heterogeneous background.</italic></p><p><italic>B) From analysis of the gel in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A and B</italic></xref><italic>, in the presence of ATP there seems to be less cleaved products especially at lower concentrations of SubA (0.03, 0,08..) compared to minus ATP. Since this is the basis of the whole assay, please clarify.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this point and for giving us an opportunity to consider it explicitly. Indeed the impact of ATP is less on the kinetics of the cleavage observed early in the assay and more on its completeness. As explained in detail in the tenth paragraph of subsection “In vitro BiP oligomerization by cross-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker at <italic>trans</italic> substrate binding sites” of the revised manuscript, these observations are consistent with ATP binding having two opposing effects on interdomain linker exposure: (i) Protection against SubA by burial at the interface of the coupled NBD and SBD; a state that equilibrates relatively rapidly with the uncoupled linker-exposed state, leading ultimately to complete digestion by SubA (ii) Enhanced exposure to SubA by release of the linker from the SBD of adjacent protomers in the oligomer. In the absence of ATP the oligomers are very stable with a low off rate. Thus the addition of SubA to the ATP<sup>minus</sup> sample leads to rapid cleavage of BiP monomers (and of the exposed protomer C from the oligomer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) with the persistence of a fraction of SubA resistant oligomeric BiP, which equilibrates very slowly with monomers.</p><p><italic>C) It is difficult to know how different mutations in Bip impact overall structure (ADDA; V461F).</italic></p><p>These mutations are well characterized in the context of the highly related <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaK, furthermore, the intact ATP-mediated coupling of the NBD and SBD of BiP<sup>V461F</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel) argues that it is not an extensively broken machine. Similar considerations apply to BiP<sup>ADDA</sup>, which retains its ability to bind BiP<sup>WT</sup> molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B &amp; 3C</xref>) and whose NBD forms a protease resistant core, characteristic of the intact protein (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>D)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8C</italic></xref> <italic>is missing an important control of ATP alone.</italic></p><p>Cycloheximide was introduced into the basal state of this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> in the revised manuscript) to lower the background of BiP oligomers and favor detection of the effect of engagement of adenosine on oligomerization.

Recently, there has been well-justified excitement by the discovery, for the first time, of an enzyme that modifies BiP (albeit by AMPylation, not ADP-ribosylation), but this modification too has been largely observed in vitro. Thus, our understanding of BiP modification is incomplete and very much a work in progress. Here we have tried to reconcile our finding to the prevailing concepts regarding the function of modified BiP, but it would be unwise to over-fit our data to these evolving concepts and we urge the reviewers too to maintain a modicum of flexibility in this regard.</p><p><italic>F) The authors conclude that stresses that inhibit protein synthesis eliminate the oligomers and promote formation of the 'B' form. Then the authors study different ER stresses, Tm, DTT, Aze to show that they also cause depletion of the oligomers, but the 'B' form does not appear. These stresses should also induce eIF2a phosphorylation and inhibit protein synthesis. However, analyses of eIF2a-P and protein synthesis were not directly studied. If the oligomers disappear, where do they go? These studies should be performed with and without ATP incubation</italic> in vitro <italic>prior to gel analysis to dissociate potential Bip ligands.</italic></p><p>A competition between oligomerization and substrate binding is consistent with fewer oligomers in cells in which protein folding in the ER is compromised directly.</p><p>Like other manipulations that inhibit protein synthesis, high levels of eIF2a phosphorylation (induced by pharmacological activation of a PERK derivative) will also promote the “B” form (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, lane 5 &amp; 6), however, though endogenous PERK is activated in cells exposed to Tm, DTT, Aze, similar levels of eIF2a phosphorylation and translational attenuation are not achieved.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>Is the ADDA mutant previously described? In the subsection “In vitro BiP oligomerization by cross-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker at trans substrate binding sites”, the authors describe the mutant as “abolishing the linker's role in allostery, disrupting the SubA cleavage site and linker's ability to serve as a BiP substrate, all whilst preserving the intrinsic ability of BiP's SBD to bind other substrates.” There is no reference given, suggesting that the data supporting these statements are derived from the later experiments of this manuscript. If this is the case, it would help to clarify that this mutant was made with the expectation of these effects that were then confirmed by the authors?</italic></p><p>We regret this omission in the earlier version of the manuscript. Similar mutations of the interdomain linker have been made and characterized years ago by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laufen et al., 1999</xref>) and their impact on SubA cleavage was assessed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paton et al., 2006</xref>).

However, the authors do attempt to create a larger model depicting the interplay between calcium, covalent modification, monomer, and oligomers. The model as proposed is consistent with the data presented, however is seems a few simple experiments could strengthen the arguments for the transitioning between these species. First, does calcium addition to pure protein prevent oligomerization (or is this perhaps as argued related to a shift in client load in the ER?)? Along the same lines, does calcium depletion impact covalent modification of BiP? Second, do mutants in R470or R492, that prevent ADP-ribosylation, impact oligomerization?</italic></p><p>The reviewer’s suggestions are most apt.</p><p>We have extensively studied the effects of calcium on BiP oligomerization in vitro in the presence or absence of nucleotide, purified J-protein and Grp170 (a Nucleotide Exchange Factor for BiP) (please see response to point 4 of reviewer 1), but no effect was observed. Thus, it would seem some component is missing from our in vitro assay. The implications of this are now discussed in paragraph 8 of the revised Discussion.</p><p>We recognize the interest of examining mutations that effect BiP modification on its ability to oligomerize.

This is a weakness of this otherwise top-notch paper: And it would seem the authors are equipped to address this question by cross-linking and mass spectrometry experiments. Another improvement of the paper that seems quite do-able is more direct characterization of the state of oligomerization (dimer, trimer, etc).

Beyond that, there is little we can be certain of (please see comments to point 5E of reviewer 2) and thus we have tried to reconcile our finding to the prevailing concepts regarding the function of modified BiP without over fitting our data to these evolving concepts.</p><p><italic>3) Results: the wording of the subheading about “Physiological release” of calcium is confusing.

This should be explained.</italic></p><p>The conspicuous species in BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> co-migrates with the monomer, both on SEC and on native gel. But the defect in oligomerization, though conspicuous, is incomplete. Lower affinity interactions that involve other elements of BiP (that, partially dissociate during SEC or native gel electrophoresis) may account for these observations. The text in the second to last paragraph of the subsection “In vitro BiP oligomerization by cross-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker at <italic>trans</italic> substrate binding sites” has been revised to incorporate this point.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>lane 2, oligomeric states of BiP disappear when modified by ADP ribosylation. The authors do not explain the discrepancy with Freiden et al. who showed that oligomeric forms of BiP harbor the modification. Perhaps more importantly, Hu et al. (PMID: 19808260) indicate that cycloheximide treatment renders BiP insensitive to SubAB cleavage in intact B cells. Yet, work in this manuscript suggests the opposite. These points should be addressed.</italic></p><p>The observations of Hu et al. are consistent with our own showing the modified form of BiP is resistant to SubA cleavage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">figure 6E and 6F</xref> of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>)). Indeed the pulse-chase labeling experiment that led Hu and colleagues to conclude that the newly synthesized BiP is selectively susceptible to SubA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> in their paper) are also consistent with the predicted effect of longer methionine depletion to activate GCN2, attenuate protein synthesis and enhance BiP modification in the longer labeling periods used to generate the older, SubA-resistant BiP.</p><p>We applaud the reviewer’s erudition in flagging these issues and much as we are tempted to incorporate these feats of mental gymnastics into the burgeoning revised manuscript, we think it best to resist and thereby refrain from over- fitting our data to prevailing concepts of BiP modification. The manuscript before you is the product of a struggle to strike an intelligent balance in this regard.</p><p><italic>3) The authors indicate that Ca++ depletion was shown earlier to interfere with BiP's ability to engage in substrate binding. If the basis of BiP's oligomerization is through its binding to its linker as a substrate, how can the oligomeric state persist upon Ca++ depletion? The attempt to explain these findings in the manuscript is not clear.</italic></p><p>This is a very important point (see response to point 4 of reviewer 1). We have incorporated an explanatory paragraph into the Discussion reproduced below:</p><p>“We do not understand how calcium depletion shifts the equilibrium in favor of the oligomer. In vitro, there is no measureable effect of calcium on BiP oligomerization, in either the ATP state or ADP state or in the presence of ERdJ3 or the exchange factor GRP170 (not shown), yet in vivo, ER calcium depletion promotes such oligomerization. This discrepancy could be resolved by an ER-localized J-factor whose affinity for BiP as a substrate is increased selectively as [Ca<sup>+2</sup>] <sub>ER</sub> declines. Given that the affinity of Hsp70 proteins for their substrates is governed by J-protein driven non-equilibrium mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014</xref>), such a scenario could account for BiP favoring itself as a client (oligomerizing) over other clients, as [Ca<sup>+2</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> declines.”</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were requested before acceptance, as outlined below.]</p><p>3 September 2015: What follows is a detailed point-by-point discussion of all the reviewers’ comments and revisions they have engendered. Here we should like to list the new experiments:</p><p>1) To address the relative roles of ATP binding versus hydrolysis we have examined the effect of ATP on the oligomeric state of a mutant BiP<sup>T229A</sup> that is defective in hydrolysis (PMID: 1835085, 7592894). Our findings (presented in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">figure 2 supplement 2</xref>) confirm that BiP<sup>T229A</sup> is indeed defective in hydrolysis (panel A) but go on to show that it retains the ability to respond to ATP by de-oligomerising (Panels B &amp; C).</p><p>In this experiment we have also measured the effect of ADP and of a non-hydrolysable ATP analog, ATP-gamma S on the oligomeric state of BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2 supplement 2A and 2B</xref>). As expected, ADP does not dissociate the oligomers. Consistent with previous experiments in which ATP gamma S has proven to be a weak regulator of allosteric transitions in DnaK (PMID: 8413631), we find that ATP gamma S is also relatively inert.</p><p>Together this line of experimentation points to a crucial role for ATP binding (not hydrolysis) in the disassembly of oligomers and showcases the sensitivity of BiP to details of the nucleotide.</p><p>2) To further address the impact of the ADDA mutation in the interdomain linker on the affinity of the linker for BiP’s binding site we compare the ability of an established BiP binding peptide [HTFPAVL], the wildtype interdomain linker [DTGDLVLLD] and the ADDA mutant derivative [DTGDADDAD] to compete for BiP oligomerization in vitro. Both the established BiP binding peptide and the wildtype interdomain linker peptide competed effectively, whilst the ADDA mutant linker peptide was without effect (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>These observations directly support the conclusion (inferred from the effects of the ADDA mutation on oligomerisation in vivo and in vitro and from the cross-linking studies) that the wildtype interdomain linker is a substrate for BiP and that the ADDA mutation, which abolishes oligomerization in vitro and in vivo achieves this by impaired binding to BiP’s substrate binding site.</p><p>3) The mass of the complexes resolved by size exclusion chromatography has been assessed by multi-angle lights scattering (MALS, a method orthogonal to migration through a gel filtration matrix) (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">figure 2-supplement 1</xref>). MALS validates the mass of complex I as that of a BiP monomer, complex II a dimer and complex III a trimer and confirm that these are distinct oligomeric species, as opposed to alternative conformations of a distinct species. As the quantization of BiP into discrete species follows a similar hierarchy on size exclusion chromatography and on native gels, we believe the insight afforded by MALS on the identity of the former is also informative in regards to the latter.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The following points need to be considered.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors include new data with mutants T37G and G226D and photocrosslinking experiments to prove the role of the interdomain in oligomerization. This still does not help to explain any possible allosteric effects of ADDA mutant itself. Is there a reason why ADDA was not included in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref> <italic>to be compared with WT and other mutants side by side?</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> reports on persistent protection of the interdomain linker from SubA digestion in the presence of ATP of the BiP<sup>T37G</sup> and BiP<sup>G226D</sup> mutants, compared with BiP<sup>WT</sup>, thereby revealing a correlation between their persistent oligomerization in the presence of ATP (lanes 6 and 8 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and the persistent protection of the linker. Subjecting the ADDA mutant BiP to SubA digestion in the same experiment would be uninformative as a test of its conformational transitions, as the ADDA mutation abolishes (<italic>in cis</italic>) the ability of BiP to serve as a substrate for SubA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and PMID 17024087; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> therein).</p><p>To cope with this limitation we have employed other proteases to probe allosteric transitions in BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>) and these dissociate the allosteric effects of the ADDA mutation from its effects on oligomerization. The conclusion that the ADDA mutation exerts its effects on oligomerization because it has low affinity for BiP’s peptide binding site is further supported by a new experiment (suggested by a reviewer) comparing the ability of an established BiP binding peptide [HTFPAVL], the wildtype interdomain linker [DTGDLVLLD] and the ADDA mutant derivative [DTGDADDAD] to compete for BiP oligomerization in vitro. Both the established BiP binding peptide and the wildtype interdomain linker peptide competed effectively, whilst the ADDA mutant linker peptide was without effect (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Since calcium has no effect</italic> in vitro<italic>, is it possible that what the authors are considering Bip oligomers</italic> in vivo <italic>are in fact Bip in complex with other endogenous substrates? This possibility needs to be considered.</italic></p><p>We believe that the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and its supplements, demonstrates the dominant contribution of BiP oligomers to the discrete species that stand out above the heterogeneous signal of BiP immunoreactivity in native gels of cell lysates. This conclusion in no way diminishes the fact that BiP also enters into heterogeneous complexes with many other clients, which likely account for the background signal. This is now explicitly stated in the preamble to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (subsection “Linker engagement at the SBD as the basis for BiP oligomerization in vivo 3” of the revised manuscript).</p><p><italic>3) The authors failed to examine effect of other nucleotides (AMP/ADP/ATPγS/GTP/GDP, etc), invalidating the claim that Bip aggregate formation is dependent on ATP concentration. Quote here, “As the reviewer well knows, ATP and ADP are expedients to shift the monomer oligomer equilibrium.” It is unclear what this statement means regarding the requirement for nucleotide and ATP hydrolysis in the oligomerization. Is the ATPase activity important for oligomer-monomer conversion?</italic></p><p>To address this valid concern, the relative roles of ATP binding versus hydrolysis have been examined by comparing the effect of ATP on the oligomeric state of wildtype with that of a mutant BiP<sup>T229A</sup> that is defective in ATP hydrolysis (PMID: 1835085, 7592894). Our findings (presented in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>) confirm that BiP<sup>T229A</sup> is indeed defective in hydrolysis (panel A) but go on to show that it retains the ability to respond to ATP by de-oligomerising (panels B &amp; C).</p><p>We have also measured the effect of ADP and of a non-hydrolysable ATP analog, ATP-gamma S, on the oligomeric state of BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2A and supplement 2B</xref>). As expected, ADP does not dissociate the oligomers. Consistent with previous experiments in which ATP gamma S has proven to be a weak regulator of allosteric transitions in DnaK (PMID: 8413631), we find that ATP gamma S is also relatively inert.</p><p>Together this line of experimentation points to a crucial role for ATP binding (not hydrolysis) in the disassembly of oligomers and showcases the sensitivity of BiP to details of the nucleotide. We thank the reviewer(s) for this insightful critique.</p></body></sub-article></article>
