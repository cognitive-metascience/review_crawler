While previous work suggested an active role of SNARE transmembrane domains (TMDs) in promoting membrane merger (Dhara et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism remained elusive. Here, we show that naturally-occurring v-SNARE TMD variants differentially regulate fusion pore dynamics in mouse chromaffin cells, indicating TMD flexibility as a mechanistic determinant that facilitates transmitter release from differentially-sized vesicles. Membrane curvature-promoting phospholipids like lysophosphatidylcholine or oleic acid profoundly alter pore expansion and fully rescue the decelerated fusion kinetics of TMD-rigidifying VAMP2 mutants. Thus, v-SNARE TMDs and phospholipids cooperate in supporting membrane curvature at the fusion pore neck. Oppositely, slowing of pore kinetics by the SNARE-regulator complexin-2 withstands the curvature-driven speeding of fusion, indicating that pore evolution is tightly coupled to progressive SNARE complex formation. Collectively, TMD-mediated support of membrane curvature and SNARE force-generated membrane bending promote fusion pore formation and expansion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>VAMP2</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>protein-lipid interplay</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>synaptobrevin2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohrmann</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruns</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Saarland, Medical Faculty</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HOMFOR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dhara</surname><given-names>Madhurima</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Naturally-occurring v-SNARE TMD variants differentially regulate fusion pore dynamics and cooperate with phospholipids in supporting membrane curvature at the fusion pore neck.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane fusion is the key event in many cell biological processes like exocytosis, intracellular cargo trafficking and even fertilization. The core of the neuronal exocytotic machinery is composed of soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment receptor proteins (SNAREs) comprising the vesicular associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2, also known as synaptobrevin2) and the plasma membrane anchored proteins Syntaxin and SNAP-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>). According to current models, SNARE-mediated fusion is initiated by the formation of an hourglass-shaped membrane stalk between the interacting membranes (fusion of the proximal leaflets) that radially widens until the distal leaflets meet and rupture, forming the nascent fusion pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003</xref>). In line with the view that the fusion pore and its preceding intermediates represent highly curved membrane structures, curvature-modulating lipid components have been shown to enhance fusion of protein-free lipid bilayers, possibly by lowering the energy barriers of the high-curvature intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2008</xref>). Similarly, application of curvature-promoting phospholipids or their de novo generation by phospholipase D has been shown to regulate reconstituted SNARE-mediated liposome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kreutzberger et al., 2017</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amatore et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Churchward et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang and Jackson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Fusion pore dynamics are not only crucial for regulating vesicle recycling but also modulate the kinetics and the extent of cargo release (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Resealing fusion pores allow for rapid recapture of intact vesicles, whereas complete membrane merger requires the de novo generation of the organelle. Since many cells co-package small and large cargo molecules in their secretory vesicles, the initial narrow pore can act as a molecular sieve causing size dependent cargo retention. In pancreatic β-cells, non-expanding fusion pores allow for release of small cargo molecules such as ATP, but hinder expulsion of insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>), a scenario that contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guček et al., 2019</xref>). Adrenal chromaffin cells release small catecholamines through flickering small pores, and can additionally release larger cargo in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fulop et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, fusion pore dynamics may even affect release of neurotransmitters and the mode of endocytosis during synaptic vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alabi and Tsien, 2013</xref>). Yet, despite the significance of pore dynamics for efficient neurotransmitter or hormone release, mechanisms controlling fusion pore expansion are still poorly understood. Even the very nature of the nascent fusion pore, being either lipidic or proteinaceous, is under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson and Chapman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we have shown that the VAMP2 TMD plays an active role in membrane fusion, catalyzing fusion initiation and fusion pore expansion at the millisecond time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhara et al., 2016</xref>). Our functional analysis supported the view that overall structural flexibility of the TMD, as promoted by the number of ß-branched amino acids (like valine or isoleucine), rather than specific residues within the VAMP2 TMD, determines the exocytotic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of v-SNARE TMDs embedded in an asymmetric membrane (to mimic the physiological lipid composition of synaptic vesicles) revealed that mutant variants with a poly-leucine or with a poly-valine TMD decrease or increase the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the backbone atoms for the peptide, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhara et al., 2016</xref>). In the same line, sequence-specific back bone dynamics of isolated TMD model helices (probed by hydrogen/deuterium exchange) enhanced the fusogenicity of liposomes in in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stelzer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quint et al., 2010</xref>), pointing to an active role of the v-SNARE TMD in the fusion mechanism. Overall, these results showed that the function of v-SNARE TMDs clearly goes beyond simple membrane anchoring, but left the mechanisms of the underlying protein-lipid interplay unclear.</p><p>Here, we set out to elucidate key aspects of the effect of v-SNARE transmembrane domains on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis. By using a combination of membrane capacitance measurements and photolytic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uncaging as well as carbon fiber amperometry, we followed vesicle exocytosis in chromaffin cells from pre- to postfusional stages. Our results show that naturally occurring v-SNARE TMD variants with higher or lower content of ß-branched amino acids than in the VAMP2 protein differentially affect fusion pore dynamics, suggesting a general physiological significance of TMD flexibility in membrane fusion and transmitter discharge. Membrane-incorporated lipids like lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) or oleic acid (OA) affected fusion induction and subsequent pore expansion in a membrane leaflet-specific fashion, correlating with their intrinsic curvature preference of the cytoplasmic and extracellular leaflet in the context of highly bent fusion intermediates. These results indicate that membrane mechanics represent a rate-limiting energy barrier for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion of chromaffin granules, which proceeds via the formation of a membrane stalk intermediate into a lipidic fusion pore. Importantly, slowing of fusion pore expansion by a v-SNARE variant with a rigid TMD was fully rescued by either intracellular OA or extracellular LPC, indicating that v-SNARE transmembrane anchors and phospholipids cooperate in membrane remodeling by supporting membrane curvature at the fusion pore neck.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Naturally occurring v-SNARE TMD variants regulate fusion pore dynamics without affecting overall secretion</title><p>Starting point of our study was the observation that v-SNARE isoforms driving fusion of differentially-sized secretory vesicles contain highly variable amounts of ß-branched amino acids within the N-terminal half of their TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhara et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Isoform usage in different tissues indicates that VAMP variants with a low number of ß-branched amino acids in this TMD region (e.g. VAMP1, 22% ß-branched amino acids) are preferentially involved in fusion of small synaptic vesicles, whereas isoforms with high content of ß-branched amino acid (e.g. VAMP8, 77% ß-branched amino acids) are responsible for fusing larger sized zymogen granules or mast cell vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As the area of highly curved membrane within the fusion pore increases with vesicle size and membrane bending is thought to oppose fusion pore expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang and Jackson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawamoto et al., 2015</xref>), it stands to reason that v-SNARE variants with a higher number of ß-branched amino acids within their TMDs represent a necessary functional adaptation to ensure rapid fusion pore expansion and <italic>bona fide</italic> cargo release. To test this hypothesis we generated chimeric mutants of VAMP2 by exchanging its TMD with that of either VAMP8 or with VAMP1 (denoted VAMP2-VAMP8TMD and VAMP2-VAMP1TMD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Secretion was determined with simultaneous membrane capacitance (CM) measurements and carbon fiber amperometry in response to continuous intracellular perfusion with solution containing 19 µM free calcium. VAMP2 and its mutant variants were comparatively analyzed in a gain-of-function approach by viral expression on the genetic null background of <italic>VAMP2</italic>/<italic>VAMP3</italic> double knock-out (dko) chromaffin cells, which are devoid of any exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borisovska et al., 2005</xref>). The expression of VAMP2-VAMP8TMD rescued total secretion like the wild type (wt) protein, as indicated by a comparable capacitance increase and similar amperometric event frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Yet, analysis of amperometric spike wave forms demonstrated that the mutant protein had a profound impact on the kinetics of transmitter discharge. This gain-of-function phenotype is characterized by significantly higher amplitudes and faster kinetics of the main amperometric spike when compared with VAMP2-mediated fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Moreover, the VAMP2-VAMP8TMD mutant also significantly shortened the prespike signal and increased its current fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which report transient changes in neurotransmitter flux through the early fusion pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kesavan et al., 2007</xref>). Analysis of the root-mean-square (rms) noise of the prespike’s current derivative, serving as a threshold-independent parameter of fusion pore fluctuations, corroborated that VAMP2-VAMP8TMD expression significantly enhances the fusion pore jitter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, expression of the VAMP2-VAMP1TMD chimera with only 22% ß-branched amino acid content in the N-terminal half of the TMD significantly slowed down catecholamine release from chromaffin granules (indicated by lower spike amplitudes, increased rise-times and half-width values, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>) without changing the overall rate of fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Immunofluorescence analyses revealed nearly similar expression levels of VAMP2 and its mutant proteins in dko cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Using high resolution structured illumination microscopy we found that the VAMP2 TMD mutants are sorted to large dense core vesicles with similar efficiency like the wt protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>), attributing the observed fusion deficits to changes in TMD-mediated function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>v-SNARE TMD variants differentially control fusion pore kinetics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Primary sequence of VAMP2 TMD and its chimeras with a VAMP8 or VAMP1 TMD. ß-branched residues of the N-terminal TMD region are highlighted in bold.

They show that not only artificial TMD mutants (carrying either helix-stabilizing leucines or flexibility–promoting ß-branched isoleucine/valine residues) but also naturally–occurring variants of v-SNARE TMDs specifically alter fusion pore dynamics without changing overall secretion or stimulus-secretion coupling. Importantly, substitution of the VAMP2 TMD with either the VAMP1 or the VAMP8 TMD caused correlated changes in spike waveform, even producing a gain-of-function phenotype in pore expansion kinetics for the VAMP8 TMD enriched in ß-branched residues. The latter phenotype of a faster catecholamine secretion for VAMP2 with the VAMP8 TMD provides strong evidence that adapting the structural flexibility of v-SNARE TMDs to the vesicle size facilitates the expansion of the fusion pores and, thus, serves the release of bulky cargo molecules from large-sized zymogen granules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Curvature-modifying phospholipids affect fusion in a leaflet-specific fashion</title><p>We next asked how v-SNARE TMDs may control the kinetic behavior of the expanding fusion pore. Recent molecular dynamics simulations showed that isolated TMDs of VAMP2 or syntaxin drastically lower the free energy of the metastable membrane stalk, an observation that was related to the local thinning of the membrane (negative hydrophobic mismatch) imposed by the TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smirnova et al., 2019</xref>).The observed mutual attraction between the stalk and TMDs accumulates the TMDs at the stalk base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smirnova et al., 2019</xref>), a scenario that may generate local (negative) curvature which eases membrane bending and pore growth. To explore this idea, we extracellularly applied lipid molecules that confer either positive (lysophosphatidyl choline, LPC) or negative (oleic acid, OA) membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We found that neither LPC nor OA (2 µM) altered the total secretion compared to controls in experiments testing tonic secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) or synchronized exocytosis (photolytic uncaging of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, extracellular application of LPC strongly accelerated the kinetics of cargo release from individual vesicles, as indicated by higher amplitudes and faster kinetics of the amperometric spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). OA, instead, slowed down the overall amperometric current indicating decelerated catecholamine release and slower fusion pore expansion.

CpxII expression, on the other hand, makes the final association of SNARE proteins a rate-limiting step that hinders the curvature-driven acceleration of nascent fusion pore expansion. Thus, fusion pore expansion (and membrane bending) can only proceed in concert with progressive zipping of the membrane-anchored SNARE pins.

These results provide strong evidence that structurally flexible v-SNARE TMDs crucially impact on exocytotic pore dynamics by promoting favorable curvature to the fusing membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model of the energy landscape <italic>en route</italic> to membrane fusion.</title><p>Vesicles states are depicted as corresponding to local minima in an energy profile.

TMD rigidity increases the energy for priming and also for pore expansion, whereas TMD flexibility profoundly lowers the latter. Intracellular OA rescues in part the secretion deficit of the VAMP2polyL mutant because the spontaneous curvature of the cytoplasmic leaflet is energetically significant in stalk formation. Neither TMD mutations nor curvature-modifying phospholipids affect the exocytosis timing. For pore expansion, instead, OA and LPC produce opposing effects in the same leaflet but similar actions when applied in different leaflets, consistent with membrane curvature-driven changes in the expansion kinetics of a purely lipidic pore. Notably, curvature accommodating phospholipids are expected to lower the energy of the semi-stable highly curved open pore state, but even more strongly reduce the energy barrier for pore growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chizmadzhev et al., 2000</xref>), thereby leveling of any differences in pore expansion between VAMP2 or its VAMP2polyL mutant.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55152-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>v-SNARE TMD variants differentially regulate membrane fusion</title><p>The transmembrane domains of SNARE proteins have long been regarded as passive elements in the membrane fusion process, serving only as anchors for the force transduction of SNARE complex formation on the membranes to be fused. Recently, we and others have shown that v-SNARE TMDs also play an autonomous, active role in exocytotic membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hastoy et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, our data suggested that the presence of ß-branched amino acids and the resulting structural flexibility of the VAMP2 TMD are crucial for promoting fusion pore expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhara et al., 2016</xref>). The different content of ß-branched amino acids in the naturally occurring TMD variants of v-SNARE proteins raised the question of whether those structural properties are exploited in facilitating the release of cargo molecules from different types of secretory vesicles. To investigate this question, we generated chimeric proteins consisting of VAMP2’s cytoplasmic domain and the TMD of VAMP8 or VAMP1 and comparatively analyzed their effects on catecholamine release. Neither the decrease nor the increase of ß-branched amino acids within the N-terminal half of the TMDs of VAMP1 and VAMP8 led to proportional changes in the secretion response when compared with VAMP2. For the VAMP2-VAMP1 TMD, it only slightly reduced the rate of tonic secretion in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and did not affect the synchronized, flash-evoked response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, only large and systematic changes in the number of helix-rigidifying amino acids, like in the VAMP2polyL mutant, are able to interfere with exocytosis initiation. In contrast, VAMP2-VAMP8 TMD mutant allowed for much faster release than the other chimera carrying only a few ß-branched amino acids in the N-terminal half of its TMD (VAMP2-VAMP1 TMD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, naturally occurring TMD variants of v-SNARE proteins do differentially affect the kinetics of transmitter release confirming an active role the TMD in the expansion of exocytotic fusion pores. In the physiological context, such a mechanism may represent an important functional adaption for tipping the balance between an expanding or non-expanding fusion pore. For VAMP8-mediated exocytosis, it ensures efficient discharge of bulky cargo molecules (e.g. hexosaminidase) from large-sized mast cell vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lippert et al., 2007</xref>). For VAMP-1 mediated SSV exocytosis at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), it allows release of small acetylcholine molecules as well as rapid recycling of SSVs by reducing the likelihood of complete merger with the plasma membrane. In comparison to the VAMP2polyL mutant, naturally occurring TMD variants change exocytosis competence (i.e. buildup of RRP/SRP) less effectively than they alter fusion pore dynamics. This behavior ensures <italic>bona fide</italic> transmitter release from differentially-sized vesicles without compromising their exocytosis competence. Notably, the VAMP2-VAMP8-TMD mutant does not simply restore the kinetics of catecholamine release, but produced a gain-of-function phenotype, wherein fusion pore dilation is even accelerated beyond the rate found for wt VAMP2. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the structural properties of the different v-SNARE TMD isoforms are optimized to meet the functional needs of the physiological release process at hand.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The role of v-SNARE TMDs in membrane fusion</title><p>The observations described above raise the important question how TMDs actually ease the induction of fusion. Exocytosis competence of secretory vesicles is likely to be accompanied by a direct approach between the membranes to be fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Previous molecular dynamics simulations have identified the first hydrophobic encounter, in which lipid tails splay and bridge to the adjacent leaflet, as a highly energy-demanding step <italic>en route</italic> to fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kasson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smirnova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Risselada et al., 2011</xref>). Our simultaneous membrane capacitance measurements (CM) and carbon fiber amperometry showed that expression of the helix-rigidifying VAMP2polyL mutant strongly diminishes exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhara et al., 2016</xref>). An attractive explanation for this phenotype would be that loss of conformational flexibility within the TMD lowers the probability of lipid splay and thereby impairs fusion initiation. In fact, our functional results are in excellent agreement with recent biochemical analyses, showing that conformationally rigid TMDs promote less proximal leaflet mixing and lipid splay than flexible TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scheidt et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations using an unbiased ‘string method’, to determine the minimum free energy path of fusion intermediates, demonstrated that isolated SNARE TMDs drastically lower the free energy of the stalk barrier and the metastable stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smirnova et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, we note that exocytosis competence or priming of vesicles does not necessarily encompass hemifusion between the opposing membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), but may represent any precursor state that is characterized by lowered intermembranous repulsion. Intracellular application of negative curvature promoting phospholipids like OA at least in part restored the reduced secretion rate seen with the polyL mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). This result is consistent with the view that cone-shaped phospholipids like OA promote the transition to the intermembrane stalk, which is characterized by net negative curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawamoto et al., 2015</xref>) or may lower the energy for overcoming the hydration repulsion between the fusing membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smirnova et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, intracellular application of curvature promoting phospholipids significantly altered synchronous secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The detailed kinetic analysis of the capacitance changes revealed that the rapidly releasable pool (RRP) was oppositely affected by OA and LPC, but no changes in exocytosis timing were observed.

By using either photolytic uncaging of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) or Ca<sup>2+</sup> infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we have observed opposite effects if the curvature-mediating lipid components were applied intracellularly and found, in contrast to Zhang and Jackson, only a slight increase in the sustained rate of secretion with LPC (p=0.04, flash experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) or no effect with their extracellular application in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-infusion experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Since LPC significantly influences the activation of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Zeev et al., 2010</xref>), potential changes in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i upon treatment of chromaffin cells with curvature-modifying lipid components may have masked their actual effect on membrane fusion, thus, providing an explanation for the apparently contradicting data. Alternatively, one might speculate that different exocytosis timing and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations stimulating fusion in the depolarization-evoked response of chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang and Jackson, 2010</xref>) and our Ca<sup>2+</sup>-infusion experiments may contribute to these apparent discrepancies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of v-SNARE TMDs in fusion pore dynamics</title><p>Above discussion does not provide an explanation for the question how v-SNARE TMDs alter subsequent fusion pore dynamics. A clue may come from recent biochemical studies showing that SNARE TMDs produce a negative hydrophobic mismatch by being too short with respect to their native membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milovanovic et al., 2015</xref>). In the same line, molecular simulation detected local thinning of the membrane imposed by SNARE TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smirnova et al., 2019</xref>). Given that a negative lipid/peptide hydrophobic mismatch causes thinning/softening of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Planque et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2016</xref>) and even promotes the formation of inverted membrane phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Planque and Killian, 2003</xref>), it is possible that the concentration of SNARE TMDs at the stalk base or the pore rim leads to local changes in membrane curvature or elasticity, that favor fusion pore expansion. Such a scenario fits well with our previous observation that substitution of the VAMP2 TMD with a lipid anchor strongly decelerated kinetics of transmitter discharge, demonstrating the inherent propensity of the proteinaceous TMD to promote fusion pore expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhara et al., 2016</xref>). It also agrees with experiments in reduced model systems suggesting that lipidic SNARE-anchors largely fail in promoting proper fusion between artificial liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McNew et al., 2000</xref>), cells expressing ‘flipped’ SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giraudo et al., 2005</xref>), or between liposomes and lipid nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2016</xref>). Our new results now also show that a TMD-mediated deceleration in fusion pore dilation can be fully compensated by adding lipid molecules with a molecular shape that is favorable for the respective leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This suggests that the actions of TMDs and curvature-generating lipids on the fusion process are similar, most likely reflecting their common ability to compensate for hydrophobic interstices associated with fusion intermediates. Notably, both tested lipid components, either OA or LPC, produce opposing effects on the cytoplasmic and extracellular leaflet, rendering the possibility unlikely that either lipid compound significantly flips between leaflets in the course of our experiments. Similar results with OA and LPC on fusion pore dynamics have previously been observed in secretion from chromaffin cells stimulated by membrane depolarizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amatore et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang and Jackson, 2010</xref>). Small fusion pores are highly curved lipidic structures that inherently exhibit regions of lipid packaging frustration as observed for membrane stalk intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smirnova et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, curvature-accommodating phospholipids are able to facilitate pore enlargement in a leaflet specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). We hypothesize that the α-helical (rigid) polyL mutant would disfavor such highly bent regions whereas more flexible TMD variants should adapt better to such structures because structural flexibility allows them to explore a larger range of conformational space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The profound impact of LPC and OA on fusion pore expansion illustrates active remodeling of membranes which negates any thermodynamic differences between the actions of the TMD variants, explaining why the addition of LPC or OA overrides the influence of the v-SNARE TMDs. Notably, comparable interactions between differentially helical TMDs and hexadecane molecules were observed for viral fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dennison et al., 2002</xref>), revealing fundamental similarities in the mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated and viral membrane fusion.</p><p>In contrast, extracellular LPC application was largely unable to reverse the delayed fusion pore expansion induced by CpxII expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This observation conveys two important points: On one hand, it shows that curvature-accommodating phospholipids do not generally accelerate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered membrane fusion in a protein-independent fashion. On the other hand, it demonstrates that successful zipping of SNAREs, encompassing the step of lifting the CpxII clamp, is a prerequisite for accelerating fusion pore expansion by curvature modifying lipids. This observation highlights important constraints in the potential sequence of molecular events leading to fusion. It renders the possibility unlikely, that SNARE complex formation has been completed before fusion pore opening, while most of its energy is intermittently stored in bending stress of the stiff linker region (connecting SNARE motif and TMD) before being utilized in a mousetrap-like mechanism to open and expand the fusion pore. The close coupling between SNARE complex formation and membrane bending illustrates that assembling SNAREs actively drive and control the whole fusion process up to the expansion of the fusion pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our results provide new insight into the interplay of SNAREs and lipids in membrane fusion. They highlight how structural flexibility as a key feature of v-SNARE TMDs together with phospholipids guides SNARE-mediated exocytosis in a functional <italic>pas de deux</italic> towards fusion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>VAMP2 – VAMP3</italic> null allele</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borisovska et al., 2005</xref></td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15920476">15920476</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">mouse anti- <break/>VAMP2</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">Cat# 104 211</td><td valign="top">ICC, 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">rabbit anti-VAMP3</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">Cat# 104 103</td><td valign="top">ICC, 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# A21422</td><td valign="top">ICC: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# A11008</td><td valign="top">ICC: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">VAMP2</td><td valign="top">GeneID: 22318</td><td valign="top">cDNA (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">VAMP1</td><td valign="top">GeneID: 22317</td><td valign="top">cDNA (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">VAMP8</td><td valign="top">GeneID: 22320</td><td valign="top">cDNA (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CpxII</td><td valign="top">GenBank: U35101.1</td><td valign="top">cDNA (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pSFV-VAMP2- <break/>IRES-EGFP</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Semliki Forest virus derived from 22318, expression of wild type full length protein</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pSFV-VAMP1- <break/>IRES-EGFP</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Semliki Forest virus derived from 22317, expression of wild type full length protein</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pSFV-VAMP8- <break/>IRES-EGFP</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Semliki Forest virus derived from 22320, expression of wild type full length protein</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pSFV-VAMP2-poly L-IRES-EGFP</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Semliki Forest virus derived from 22318 <break/>with indicated mutations</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pSFV-VAMP2-VAMP1TMD-IRES-EGFP</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Semliki Forest virus derived from 22318 and from 22317, chimeric mutant protein</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pSFV-VAMP2-VAMP8TMD-IRES-EGFP</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Semliki Forest virus derived from 22318 and from 22320, chimeric mutant protein</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pSFV-CpxII- <break/>IRES-EGFP</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Semliki Forest virus derived from U35101.1;

The authors study synaptobrevin2 constructs where the transmembrane domain is replaced by that of synaptobrevin1 or that of VAMP8. They show that the increased content of β-branched residues in the VAMP8 transmembrane domain and the decreased content of β-branched residues in the synaptobrevin1 transmembrane domain have the corresponding effects on amperometric spike and foot kinetics, which is an interesting finding and the potential physiological significance in terms of fusion pore dilation needs in different cell types provides a reasonable conclusion. However, these manipulations did not affect the size of the exocytotic burst in caged calcium experiments. The authors also investigate if lipids regulate fusion pore kinetics. The effects of LPC and OA on fusion pore kinetics largely confirm previous results but additional and contradictory results are presented on spike kinetics and exocytosis rates. There is a long-standing debate on the nature, lipidic or proteinaceous, of the fusion pore. The authors propose here both transmembrane domains and lipids act together.</p><p>However, considering that this work is closely related to the work by Dhara et al., 2016 and lacks the novelty we would expect for an independent Research Article, it will be treated as a Research Advance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Much emphasis is set on &quot;adaptation of TMD variants with distinct conformational flexibility&quot; to ensure efficiency of release &quot;from differentially sized vesicles&quot;. A more detailed analysis of this hypothesis would be interesting. For example, more insight into the content of β-branched amino acids in transmembrane domains versus vesicle size for additional vesicle SNAREs (i.e. all VAMPs – 1,2,3,4,5,7,8) would be useful.</p><p>Surprisingly, the size of the exocytotic burst in caged calcium experiments, which is not discussed. While in their past work, the authors reported a profound decrease of the RRP/SRP for the polyL construct, no change is observed for the Syb1 TM domain, which deserves a discussion.</p><p>The experiments with lysoPC and OA (Figure 5) repeat previous studies by Zhang and Jackson, 2010, which is cited by the authors. The authors state that their findings contradict those previous ones. There are some issues with the discussion of Zhang and Jackson, 2010. Zhang and Jackson studied the effects of LPC and OA in chromaffin cells, not in PC12 cells, as stated by the authors and the effects of intracellular LPC and OA were studied in patch clamp experiments with stimulation by 6s depolarization. It is not evident how these very different experiments are contradicted by the data presented here.</p><p>Zhang and Jackson, 2010 reported that extracellular LPC reduces foot duration whereas extracellular OA increased foot duration. Intracellular LPC and OA has the opposite effect. These results are fully consistent with the results reported in this manuscript and this should be clearly stated in the Discussion.</p><p>Zhang and Jackson reported an increase in spike rates with extracellular OA and a decrease in spike rates with extracellular LPC in chromaffin cells stimulated with high K. A small increase in exocytosis is also evident in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B (caged Ca<sup>2+</sup>). One question relates to the protocol used in the present manuscript. For intracellular dialysis with 19 µM free Ca<sup>2+</sup> it is not clear how to interpret the data of panels such as Figure 4A and B. What is time zero in Figure 4A and similar panels and how much of the RRP/SRP is actually recorded here? Could this difference in protocols explain the apparent discrepancy with Zhang and Jackson, 2010 when it comes to exocytosis rates? Is there an effect of LPC/OA incubation time? Another difference is the adult rat vs. embryonal mouse dko cells with viral transfection of Syb2.</p><p>The results on the overall fusion kinetics triggered by calcium seem to be contradictory to their previous publication: the transmembrane mutations dramatically change the overall kinetics of membrane fusion in previous work (Figure 1 in Dhara et al., 2016), whereas no effect is observed in this work (Figure 2). Please explain.</p><p>The effect of curvature-generating lipids on membrane fusion has been extensively investigated. The results in this work seem to confirm the major conclusions from these previous results. Please discuss.</p><p>Similar effects are observed for alteration of v-SNARE transmembrane domains and lipids, likely suggesting a common underlying mechanism. Do the transmembrane domains generate curvature in a way similar to cone-shaped lipids? Or do the transmembrane domains affect the overall protein-membrane bending flexibility? The authors attribute the transmembrane domain effect to flexibility. It is unclear to what aspect of &quot;flexibility&quot; that the authors refer to. Moreover, are there explicit experimental data that show that transmembrane domains with more branched residues are more flexible?</p><p>It is unclear if cone-shaped lipids (like OA) fit the fusion stalk better than an inverted cone (like LPC), although this idea is widely found in the literature. The stalk has a negative Gaussian curvature, meaning opposing curvatures: while OA certainly fits better to the stalk along the pore direction from an intracellular side, it does not fit well to the stalk along the direction perpendicular to the neck. To see this more clearly, one may stretch the stalk without a change in pore diameter, the neck would approach a zero Gaussian curvature. In this case, PLC would be expected to stabilize the stalk. Given the uncertainty in the geometry of a stalk, it seems likely that OA and LPC can cooperatively stabilize the stalk. Thus, it is unclear why one is favored and the other is not.</p><p>Presentation:</p><p>In several places the authors assume that reader will have prior knowledge of the concepts and the authors' earlier work. This makes the text harder to follow. As an example, the content of β-branched aminoacids in TMDs is often related to &quot;TMD flexibility&quot; in general, but the directionality of the relationship is never directly stated. For example, higher number of β-branched amino acids confer more flexibility to the TMD of VAMP2. Some of this was explained in the earlier (Dhara et al., 2016), so please modify the Introduction accordingly by beginning to reference the earlier work explicitly at the beginning.</p><p>The main motivation for this study is to investigate the mechanism by which the SNARE transmembrane domains promote fusion. The authors point out correctly that recent work suggested an active role of SNARE transmembrane domains. However, they do not give credit to the publications that initially established the significance of the transmembrane domains such as McNew et al., 2000. They also need to put their work into perspective relating it other studies looking at the mechanism by which the SNARE TM domains promote fusion, such as Ngatchou et al., 2010 PNAS. Sharma and Lindau, 2018 PNAS, proposed a detailed mechanism for the function of the SNARE TMDs. How do the results presented here relate to that mechanism? Are they consistent with it or do they suggest otherwise?</p><p>The discussion on the role of v-SNARE transmembrane domains in fusion and in fusion pore dynamics should be made more concise and should specifically relate to vSNARE transmembrane domain roles that have been proposed in the literature. Does the study presented here support or invalidate any of the proposed mechanisms? The authors should also discuss how they explain the observed effects (or absence thereof) of LPC and OA on fusion rates.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Synergistic actions of v-SNARE transmembrane domains and membrane-curvature modifying lipids in neurotransmitter release&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised Research Advance has been evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are two remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The difference in protocols may contribute to the discrepancies between the current results and those of Zhang and Jackson, 2010. The effects of LPC and OA were investigated with very different protocols. Zhang and Jackson's experiments used 6s depolarization by KCl or whole cell patch clamp depolarization, with the highest fusion rates appearing early on while in the present manuscript whole cell infusion of buffered Ca<sup>2+</sup> is applied with recording starting 3s after opening the cell. In addition to this difference in timing, the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations stimulating fusion events were presumably very different. These differences need to be discussed as possible cause of the apparent discrepancies.</p><p>2) Please add a discussion on the differential flexibility requirements of fusion pore dynamics and RRP/SRP support, which deserves a clear statement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55152.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Much emphasis is set on &quot;adaptation of TMD variants with distinct conformational flexibility&quot; to ensure efficiency of release &quot;from differentially sized vesicles&quot;.

In good agreement with our hypothesis, we now show that the VAMP8 TMD accelerates but the VAMP1 TMD decelerates transmitter release from single granules. Thus, not only artificial TMD mutants (carrying either helix-stabilizing leucines or flexibility–promoting β-branched isoleucine/valine residues) as studied by Dhara et al., 2016, but also naturally–occurring variants of v-SNARE TMDs specifically alter fusion pore dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Surprisingly, the size of the exocytotic burst in caged calcium experiments, which is not discussed.

For the VAMP2-VAMP1 TMD, it only slightly reduced the rate of tonic secretion in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-infusion (Figure 1A, B) and did not affect the synchronized, flash-evoked response (Figure 2). Thus, only large and systematic changes in the number of helix-rigidifying amino acids, like in the VAMP2polyL mutant, are able to interfere with exocytosis initiation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments with lysoPC and OA (Figure 5) repeat previous studies by Zhang and Jackson, 2010, which is cited by the authors.

Indeed, Zhang and Jackson used both, chromaffin cells and PC12 cells in their previous study (Zhang and Jackson, 2010). For intracellular application of phospholipids via the patch pipette depolarizations were employed, whereas for extracellular application KCl-mediated stimulation was used. We have now corrected this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Yet, our results clearly counter those found by Zhang and Jackson (as stated already in the original manuscript):</p><p>“Our findings contradict earlier observations that suggested elevated exocytosis by intracellular LPC and inhibitory effects by OA in response to depolarization-evoked stimulation of chromaffin cells (Zhang and Jackson, 2010). By using either photolytic uncaging of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) or Ca<sup>2+</sup> infusion (Figure 4), we have observed opposite effects if the curvature-mediating lipid components were applied intracellularly and found, in contrast to Zhang and Jackson, only a slight increase in the sustained rate of secretion with LPC (p=0.04, flash experiments, Figure 3—figure supplement 1) or no effect with their extracellular application in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-infusion experiments (Figure 3).”</p><p>To provide a solution for these apparent discrepancies, we continued:</p><p>“Since LPC significantly influences the activation of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (Ben-Zeev et al., 2010), potential changes in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> upon treatment of chromaffin cells with curvature-modifying lipid components may have masked their actual effect on membrane fusion, thus, providing an explanation for the apparently contradicting data.”</p><p>Given the suppressing effect of LPC on voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (Ben-Zeev et al., 2010), we on purpose stimulated exocytosis in chromaffin cells by either direct Ca<sup>2+</sup>-infusion or photolytic uncaging of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Zhang and Jackson, 2010 reported that extracellular LPC reduces foot duration whereas extracellular OA increased foot duration.

This result is consistent with the view that the spontaneous curvature of the cytoplasmic leaflet is energetically significant in intermembranous stalk formation, as stated in the legend of Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One question relates to the protocol used in the present manuscript.

To minimize flipping of lipid molecules across the leaflets, we incubated cells for 3 min with the lipids and measured the cells within the next 20 min. As emphasized in the Discussion, OA and LPC, produce opposing effects on the cytoplasmic and extracellular leaflet, rendering the possibility unlikely that either lipid compound significantly flips between leaflets in the course of our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another difference is the adult rat vs. embryonal mouse dko cells with viral transfection of Syb2.</p></disp-quote><p>We would not expect that the fundamental effects of curvature-modifying lipid molecules on membrane fusion differ among species like rat or mouse.

Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>This suggestion is probably due to a misunderstanding in the interpretation of our previous data. Our earlier experiments (Figure 1 in Dhara et al., 2016) have clearly shown that mutating the TMD core residues (amino acid positions 97-112) to helix-stabilizing leucines does not alter the rate constants of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release from RRP/SRP vesicles or the secretory delay, which are generally considered parameters describing stimulus-secretion coupling. In stark contrast, the size of SRP and RRP was dramatically reduced – but not to the exact same degree, resulting in the impression of a slight kinetic distortion. These results were interpreted as a fusion arrest of a population of vesicles caused by the PolyL mutant, but not as a triggering deficit. In our new dataset, we did not find any indication of a triggering effect, as rate constants were similarly unaffected for the chimeric TMD mutants. However, RRP and SRP were also unchanged, highlighting that the remaining flexibility of the chimeric TMD mutants is still sufficient to avert fusion arrest but does not allow pore evolution at normal velocity. Thus, there is no contradiction to the results reported previously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The effect of curvature-generating lipids on membrane fusion has been extensively investigated.

Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we now explicitly state similarities, as well as discrepancies to previously published work in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similar effects are observed for alteration of v-SNARE transmembrane domains and lipids, likely suggesting a common underlying mechanism. Do the transmembrane domains generate curvature in a way similar to cone-shaped lipids? Or do the transmembrane domains affect the overall protein-membrane bending flexibility?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that these mechanistic questions are of central importance. As discussed in the original manuscript our results agree well with recent molecular dynamics simulations demonstrating that isolated SNARE TMDs drastically lower the free energy of the stalk barrier and the metastable stalk (Smirnova et al., 2019). Furthermore, our functional results are in excellent agreement with recent biochemical analyses, showing that conformationally rigid TMDs promote less proximal leaflet mixing and lipid splay than flexible TMDs (Scheidt et al., 2018). Therefore, an attractive explanation for this phenotype of the VAMP2polyL mutant would be that loss of conformational flexibility within the TMD lowers the probability of lipid splay and thereby impairs fusion initiation. We further note that intracellular application of negative curvature promoting phospholipids like OA at least in part restored the reduced secretion rate seen with polyL mutant (Figure 6A-C). This result is consistent with the view that cone-shaped phospholipids like OA promote the transition to the intermembrane stalk, which is characterized by net negative curvature (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2008; Kawamoto et al., 2015) or may lower the energy for overcoming the hydration repulsion between the fusing membranes (Smirnova et al., 2019). Overall, these results suggest synergistic actions of lipids and SNARE-TMDs, which are critical for lowering the energy barrier to establish exocytosis competence.</p><p>With respect to the question how v-SNARE TMDs alter subsequent fusion pore dynamics, we pointed out in the Discussion that SNARE TMDs produce a negative hydrophobic mismatch by being too short with respect to their native membranes (Milovanovic et al., 2015). In the same line, molecular simulation detected local thinning of the membrane imposed by SNARE TMDs (Smirnova et al., 2019). Given that a negative lipid/peptide hydrophobic mismatch causes thinning/softening of membranes (de Planque et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2012; Agrawal et al., 2016) and even promotes the formation of inverted membrane phases (de Planque and Killian, 2003), it is possible that the concentration of SNARE TMDs at the stalk base or the pore rim leads to local changes in membrane curvature or elasticity, that favor fusion pore expansion. Such a scenario fits well with our previous observation that substitution of the VAMP2 TMD with a lipid anchor strongly decelerated kinetics of transmitter discharge, demonstrating the inherent propensity of the proteinaceous TMD to promote fusion pore expansion (Dhara et al., 2016). Strikingly, our new results now show that a TMD-mediated deceleration in fusion pore dilation can be largely eliminated by adding lipid molecules with a molecular shape that is favorable for the respective leaflet (Figures 5 and 6). This suggests that the actions of TMDs and curvature-generating lipids on the fusion process are similar, most likely reflecting their common ability to compensate for hydrophobic interstices associated with fusion intermediates. Further mechanistic studies are required to provide a more conclusive understanding of the fusion pore architecture. Taken together, we are convinced that we have thoroughly addressed the above questions in the discussion of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors attribute the transmembrane domain effect to flexibility.

Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of v-SNARE TMDs embedded in an asymmetric membrane (to mimic the physiological lipid composition of synaptic vesicles) revealed that mutant variants with a poly-leucine or with a poly-valine TMD decrease or increase the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the backbone atoms for the peptide, respectively (Dhara et al., 2016). In the same line, sequence-specific back bone dynamics of isolated TMD model helices (probed by hydrogen/deuterium exchange) enhanced the fusogenicity of liposomes in in vitro assays (Stelzer et al., 2008; Quint et al., 2010), pointing to an active role of the v-SNARE TMD in the fusion mechanism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear if cone-shaped lipids (like OA) fit the fusion stalk better than an inverted cone (like LPC), although this idea is widely found in the literature. The stalk has a negative Gaussian curvature, meaning opposing curvatures: while OA certainly fits better to the stalk along the pore direction from an intracellular side, it does not fit well to the stalk along the direction perpendicular to the neck. To see this more clearly, one may stretch the stalk without a change in pore diameter, the neck would approach a zero Gaussian curvature. In this case, PLC would be expected to stabilize the stalk. Given the uncertainty in the geometry of a stalk, it seems likely that OA and LPC can cooperatively stabilize the stalk. Thus, it is unclear why one is favored and the other is not.</p></disp-quote><p>The energy to achieve hemifusion is sensitive to the monolayer’s curvature. As appreciated by the reviewer adding LPC to the contacting monolayers is a standard experimental procedure to inhibit hemifusion and has been shown to block fusion in a large variety of different systems (for review see Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003). We also agree with the reviewer that for a roughly hourglass-shaped stalk, one surface curvature is positive, whereas the other is negative. The bending energy is expected to be at its minimum when the mean of the positive and the negative curvatures approaches the spontaneous curvature of the cytoplasmic monolayer. Accordingly the stalk will adjust its shape to minimize its energy (Markin and Albanesi, Biophys. J. 82:693-712, 2002), when the spontaneous curvature is changed by LPC. Yet, even with adjustment of the stalk shape, explicit calculation showed that the positive curvature of LPC will increase the stalk energy, consistent with fusion inhibition seen with inverted cone-shaped lipids (see Figure 8 in Kozlovsky et al., 2002, Biophys. J. 83, 2634-2651; Cohen and Melikan, J. Membr. Biol. 199, 1-14, 2004;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Presentation:</p><p>In several places the authors assume that reader will have prior knowledge of the concepts and the authors' earlier work.

They rather suggest that curvature-accommodating phospholipids facilitate stalk formation, catalyze the transition to pore opening and promote pore enlargement, results which are clearly in accord with the continuum ‘stalk-pore’ model of membrane fusion (Chizmadzhev et al., 1995; Chizmadzhev et al., 2000; Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are two remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The difference in protocols may contribute to the discrepancies between the current results and those of Zhang and Jackson, 2010. The effects of LPC and OA were investigated with very different protocols. Zhang and Jackson's experiments used 6s depolarization by KCl or whole cell patch clamp depolarization, with the highest fusion rates appearing early on while in the present manuscript whole cell infusion of buffered Ca<sup>2+</sup> is applied with recording starting 3s after opening the cell. In addition to this difference in timing, the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations stimulating fusion events were presumably very different. These differences need to be discussed as possible cause of the apparent discrepancies.</p></disp-quote><p>To accommodate the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the following text:</p><p>“Alternatively, one might speculate that different exocytosis timing and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations stimulating fusion in the depolarization-evoked response of chromaffin cells (Zhang and Jackson, 2010) and our Ca<sup>2+</sup>-infusion experiments may contribute to these apparent discrepancies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please add a discussion on the differential flexibility requirements of fusion pore dynamics and RRP/SRP support, which deserves a clear statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We now state:</p><p>“In comparison to the VAMP2polyL mutant, naturally occurring TMD variants change exocytosis competence (i.e. buildup of RRP/SRP) less effectively than they alter fusion pore dynamics. This behavior ensures bona fide transmitter release from differentially-sized vesicles without compromising their exocytosis competence.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
