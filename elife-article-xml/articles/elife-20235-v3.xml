Indeed, male sterility is common among aneuploid mice used to study chromosomal abnormalities, and male germline transmission of exogenous DNA has been rarely reported. Here we show that, despite aberrant testis architecture, males of the aneuploid Tc1 mouse strain produce viable sperm and transmit human chromosome 21 to create aneuploid offspring. In these offspring, we mapped transcription, transcriptional initiation, enhancer activity, non-methylated DNA, and transcription factor binding in adult tissues. Remarkably, when compared with mice derived from female passage of human chromosome 21, the chromatin condensation during spermatogenesis and the extensive epigenetic reprogramming specific to male germline transmission resulted in almost indistinguishable patterns of transcriptional deployment. Our results reveal an unexpected tolerance of aneuploidy during mammalian spermatogenesis, and the surprisingly robust ability of mouse developmental machinery to accurately deploy an exogenous chromosome, regardless of germline transmission.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20235.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20235.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>male germline</kwd><kwd>epigenetic reprogramming</kwd><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A20412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ernst</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name><name><surname>Aitken</surname><given-names>Sarah J</given-names></name><name><surname>Eling</surname><given-names>Nils</given-names></name><name><surname>Connor</surname><given-names>Frances</given-names></name><name><surname>Rayner</surname><given-names>Tim F</given-names></name><name><surname>Lukk</surname><given-names>Margus</given-names></name><name><surname>Kutter</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name><name><surname>Odom</surname><given-names>Duncan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106563/Z/14/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aitken</surname><given-names>Sarah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>615584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Odom</surname><given-names>Duncan T</given-names></name><name><surname>Rayner</surname><given-names>Timothy F</given-names></name><name><surname>Connor</surname><given-names>Frances</given-names></name><name><surname>Lukk</surname><given-names>Margus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098024/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Molecular Biology Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eling</surname><given-names>Nils</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transmission of an entire human chromosome through the mouse male germline reveals an unexpectedly high tolerance of aneuploidy during male meiosis and results in accurate transcriptional deployment despite massive epigenetic remodeling during spermatogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most human aneuploidies originate maternally. The most common viable aneuploidy in humans is Down Syndrome, which is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 that is maternally inherited in over 90% of all cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hultén et al., 2010</xref>). An elegant mouse model of human Down Syndrome is the aneuploid Tc1 mouse, which transmits an almost complete copy of human chromosome 21 (HsChr21) via the female germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O'Doherty et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sheppard et al., 2012</xref>). More generally, passage of aneuploid DNA via the female germline is preferred in the majority of trisomic mouse models, most of which exhibit total male sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davisson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hernandez and Fisher, 1999</xref>). Across mammals, efficient and stable male germline transmission of foreign aneuploid DNA has only been reported in mice for comparatively small human artificial or fragmented chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tomizuka et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Voet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weuts et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms of mammalian gametogenesis disfavour paternally-derived aneuploidies as a result of sexual dimorphism in meiosis: female meiosis can extend over decades and is thus more error-prone, whereas male meiosis is a continuous process with stringent quality checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hunt and Hassold, 2002</xref>). Indeed, human gametes show an order of magnitude difference in the occurrence of chromosomal abnormalities between oocytes (20%) and sperm (2–4%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Male- and female-derived haploid genomes furthermore differ in the epigenetic reprogramming they experience during gametogenesis, fertilization, and zygotic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kota and Feil, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oswald et al., 2000</xref>). Throughout this process, the maternally passaged haploid genome remains histone-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantone and Fisher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimmins and Sassone-Corsi, 2005</xref>). In stark contrast, spermatogenesis results in a form of DNA that is 6–20 times more compact than histone-bound DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balhorn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dadoune, 1995</xref>). This compaction is achieved by replacing histone proteins with sperm-specific protamine proteins, leaving very few histones bound to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brykczynska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erkek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hammoud et al., 2009</xref>). After gametic fusion, these protamines must be removed and replaced <italic>de novo</italic> with histones by the zygote’s epigenetic machinery to initiate development.</p><p>Sperm development is associated with massive and genome-wide derepression of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Soumillon et al., 2013</xref>). During male meiosis, almost all genes, as well as otherwise-silenced repeat elements, are expressed at extremely high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ward et al., 2013</xref>). Once sperm mature, transcription is almost entirely silenced, only to be reactivated after fertilization during the maternal to zygotic transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hammoud et al., 2014</xref>). Whether this male germline-specific transcriptional activation and repression can accurately handle exogenous repeat sequences is entirely unexplored.</p><p>Here, we reveal that an almost complete copy of human chromosome 21 can be readily transmitted via mouse sperm in the Tc1 aneuploid mouse model of Down Syndrome. We demonstrate that the male mouse-transmitted human chromosome is accurately regulated and transcribed in derived somatic tissues, despite having undergone chromatin condensation and epigenetic reprogramming associated with spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Male mice carrying human chromosome 21 exhibit a subfertility phenotype</title><p>To assess the fertility of male mice carrying human chromosome 21 (Tc1), we performed phenotypic and histological comparisons with wild-type littermates that did not inherit human chromosome 21 (Tc0).

The Tc1 males’ subfertility phenotype was characterized by the absence (spermatogenic arrest) or reduced frequency (hypo-spermatogenesis) of secondary spermatocytes, as well as the absence of any cell types derived from these (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borg et al., 2010</xref>).

While the vast majority of tubules in wild-type littermates showed normal spermatogenesis, we found phenotypically normal tubules marked by the production of mature sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, blue arrowheads) at lower frequencies than abnormal tubules that show very little or no sperm production in Tc1 males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, while defective tubules in wild-types mainly displayed an absence of mature sperm, defective tubules in Tc1 males often displayed failures in chromosome segregation during metaphase of meiosis I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, red arrowheads and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Because chromosomal aneuploidy has been associated with unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turner et al., 2004</xref>), we stained for the DSB marker γH2AFX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rogakou et al., 1998</xref>).

We used the presence of the entire mouse genome in both Tc1 samples as internal technical controls to evaluate what genome-wide correlation in transcription initiation would be expected between diploid individuals.

In most cases, differences were due to modest changes in overall ChIP intensity, not the occurrence of entirely novel occupancy in male- or female-derived Tc1 mice. The noisier correlation of Pol II is likely due to the more distributed nature of polymerase genome occupancy: Pol II typically binds across tens of kilobases at comparatively low intensity, as opposed to more sharply defined regions occupied by modified histones in active regions of the genome. Notably, the modest differences observed in polymerase occupancy do not impact the transcriptome, which shows exceptionally high correlation between livers of Tc1 female- and male-derived offspring (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.97), with no genes identified as differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>Overall, despite the massive epigenetic remodelling and chromatin condensation associated with male germline transmission, human chromosome 21 is accurately deployed in multiple diverse tissues during development by the mouse epigenetic machinery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The creation of haploid gametes is one of the most tightly regulated processes in cell biology, as failure to accurately evaluate DNA content can result in catastrophic organismal aneuploidies.

Male sterility is commonly observed amongst transchromosomic mouse models, and is attributed to the presence of an extra chromosome rather than the trisomic gene content, causing spermatogenic arrest at metaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hernandez and Fisher, 1999</xref>).</p><p>How Tc1 male testes handle human chromosome 21 during spermatogenesis, particularly during prophase I, has been previously studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mahadevaiah et al., 2008</xref>). In more than 50% of the cases, human chromosome 21 is incorporated into the large γH2AFX domain together with X and Y chromosome to mask their incomplete synapsis, resulting in transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Handel, 2004</xref>). However, independent of whether human chromosome 21 would be unsynapsed and in proximity to the XY body or self-synapsed and located away from XY, the presence of human chromosome 21 did not lead to increased pachytene apoptosis in epithelial stage IV tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mahadevaiah et al., 2008</xref>). Whether this would allow the production of viable sperm and the transmission of chromosome 21 to the next generation, however, was not tested.</p><p>The first successful passage of human DNA via mouse germline followed the development of microcell-mediated chromosome transfer of human chromosome fragments into mouse ES cells. Mice derived from these ES cells were able to passage fragmented regions of human DNA via the female and occasionally male germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tomizuka et al., 1997</xref>). To date, the largest successful and stable germline transmission of human DNA via mouse sperm was of a circularized 5–10 megabase human artificial chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Voet et al., 2001</xref>); a linearized version of this same artificial chromosome containing short telomeres can also be passaged via sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weuts et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated that mouse male meiosis can produce viable sperm that both carries and transmits the complete 42 MB copy of human chromosome 21 to generate viable aneuploid offspring. Consistent with the reduced fertility described above for aneuploid males, Tc1 testes show macro- and microscopically visible disruptions to their tissue architecture. Nevertheless, despite frequent spermatogenic arrest at metaphase I leading to increased apoptosis, the majority of Tc1 males tested in this study were able to produce viable aneuploid offspring, albeit at lower frequencies. The observed lower transmission rate of HsChr21, however, cannot be fully accounted for by the reduced number of HsChr21 positive cells produced during male meiosis. This indicates that failures are likely to occur further downstream, i.e. during sperm maturation, at fertilization or during early embryonic development, eventually resulting in only ~ 11% aneuploid offspring. If the deficit in Tc1-positive offspring arises post-fertilization, then these embryos lost during early development may have been unable to accurately deploy the Tc1 chromosome. While female meiosis is more error-prone than male meiosis due to weaker checkpoint mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morelli and Cohen, 2005</xref>), the percentage of aneuploid cells produced via male meiosis (34%) is strikingly similar to the percentage of aneuploid offspring generated via female germline transmission.</p><p>Attempts to establish the Tc1 chromosome on three different inbred genetic backgrounds led to a complete loss of HsChr21 over only a few generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O'Doherty et al., 2005</xref>). The loss of the human chromosome was independent of the sex of the transmitting parent, and stable transmission was only observed when Tc1 mice were crossed with F1 hybrids between BL6 and 129S8 mice. It is currently unclear why a heterozygous genetic background is necessary to maintain stable transmission of HsChr21 or to what extent strain-specific checkpoint mechanisms may be involved. Studies in XO females have suggested that C3H mice have a weaker spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) than C57/BL6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LeMaire-Adkins and Hunt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagaoka et al., 2011</xref>); no equivalent studies are available for the 129S8 strain. However, few transcriptional differences exist between the testes of 129S8xBL6 F1 hybrids (Tc0) and inbred wild-type BL6 mice (data not shown).</p><p>The Tc1 mouse has long been an elegant model of human Down syndrome that recapitulates many clinical features of human trisomy 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O'Doherty et al., 2005</xref>). Histologically, the subfertility phenotypes we observed for the Tc1 mouse may be similar to developmental abnormalities reported for human males trisomic for chromosome 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johannisson et al., 1983</xref>). Down syndrome, especially when paternally inherited, exhibits a strong sex bias (up to a 3.5 male/female ratio), which has been attributed to a preference of the extra chromosome to segregate with the Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hassold et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nicolaidis and Petersen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petersen et al., 1993</xref>). In contrast, however, we did not observe a sex bias amongst aneuploid offspring from either female or male germline transmission (1.0 and 1.1, respectively), possibly reflecting interspecies differences in segregation patterns.</p><p>The successful passage of the human chromosome through the male germline held the potential to further unmask human-specific repetitive elements, because of the genome-wide transcriptional activation occurring during spermatogenesis and the (assumed) absence of species-specific mechanisms that co-evolved to repress human repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacobs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zamudio and Bourc’his, 2010</xref>). However, no additional repeat elements appeared to be transcriptionally activated in somatic tissues following male germline transmission. Instead, the massive epigenomic remodelling associated with histone removal during spermatogenesis and the subsequent rebuilding post fertilization resulted in the same patterns of DNA hypomethylation, transcriptional activation, enhancer deployment, transcription factor binding, and RNA transcription in male-derived offspring as was found in female germline passaged mice.</p><p>Our results reveal the remarkable insight that mouse male meiosis can tolerate the presence of an aneuploid 42 MB human chromosome to generate viable sperm. The radically differing developmental dynamics of male- versus female-germline passage of this aneuploid chromosome can nevertheless result in indistinguishable transcriptional and regulatory phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse material</title><p>The Tc1 mouse line was obtained from Dr. E.

These tracks were used for visualization on the UCSC Genome Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kent et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Differential binding analysis</title><p>Differential binding analysis on enriched regions was performed as in Ross-Innes <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ross-Innes et al., 2012</xref>), using the R/Bioconductor package DiffBind (version 1.14.5). Using dba.count, peaks were required to be present in at least one fourth of all replicates and reads were normalised using the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) method using the effective library size after subtracting control reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robinson and Oshlack, 2010</xref>). Differentially bound sites were defined to have at least 2.5-fold difference in binding intensity with an FDR of less than 0.1 between conditions. The log2 mean read concentration as defined by DiffBind was plotted using ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wickham, 2009</xref>). The correlation between samples was calculated using Pearson’s correlation.</p><p>Functional annotation for genomic regions were obtained using the R/Bioconductor package compEpiTools function GRannotateSimple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kishore et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Generation of ChIP-Seq intensity heatmaps</title><p>Pileup bedGraph files normalised to reads per million as generated by macs2 were used to plot ChIP-Seq intensity heatmaps. Bigwig files for ChIP and input libraries were uploaded onto Galaxy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afgan et al., 2016</xref>) and input reads were subtracted from ChIP reads. Heatmaps were generated using the ‘computeMatrix’ and ‘plotHeatmap’ function from deepTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramírez et al., 2014</xref>). Regions were sorted by decreasing signal strength in tissues from female germline-derived Tc1 mice, each row representing a 5 kb window around a H3K4me3 peak summit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Repeat overlap</title><p>Peak summits for shared and Tc1-specific sites were redefined in DiffBind using dba.count (summits = 25) and obtained using dba.peakset. The obtained 50 bp windows centred on H3K4me3 peak summits were then overlapped with repetitive elements on HsChr21 obtained from RepeatMasker (Smit, AFA., Hubley, R., Green P., RepeatMasker Open-3.0.1996–2010) with simple, telomeric and centromeric repeats removed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the CRUK-CI Genomics, Bioinformatics, Flow Cytometry (M Strzelecki, R Grenfell), Light Microscopy and Histopathology (J Miller, J Jones) cores and the Biological Resources Unit for technical assistance.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Ernst et al. report successful transmission of the human chromosome 21 derivative Tc1 through the male germ line, albeit at low frequency. This is surprising not only because it demonstrates successful paternal transmission of a trisomic chromosome, but also because it concerns transmission of a human chromosome with a human centromere. In mice, trisomy is associated with germ cell arrest at meiotic metaphase I, due to activation of the meiotic spindle checkpoint by the univalent trisomic chromosome. The spindle checkpoint is more efficient in males than in females, which means that transmission of trisomic chromosomes through the male germ line is problematic. The influence of spermatogenesis versus oogenesis on epigenetic remodelling of trisomic chromosomes has thus been difficult to examine, and the authors present a model, albeit with a human chromosome, where this can be addressed. The authors use this Tc1 mouse model to ask whether paternal versus maternal transmission imparts differences in the transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of the Tc1 chromosome in somatic tissues from offspring. Using a selection of complementary genome-wide approaches to look at chromatin marks, transcription and tissue-specific transcription factor binding in somatic tissues, they find no notable differences, implying that the Tc1 can be equivalently deployed irrespective of parent of origin. The authors also find signs of globally increased gH2AX levels during spermatogenesis in Tc1 males, which they attribute to apoptosis due to aberrant activation of the spindle check point, which may account for the incomplete transmission of the Tc1 chromosome.</p><p>This study represents a unique, in depth molecular evaluation of the impact of paternal versus maternal transmission of a trisomic human chromosome in the mouse. It is a succinct, well written and interesting manuscript that will appeal to a broad audience encompassing germ cell and chromosome biologists.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors did not examine the fate of the human chromosome after paternal or maternal inheritance following fertilization and zygotic gene activation. Indeed, any carry over of DNA damage or altered chromatin of the trisomic, human chromosome 21 might lead to loss of some embryos following paternal inheritance. As the authors note that only 11% of offspring, presumably genotyped post weaning, inherit the Tc1 from carrier fathers, it is important to assay when this skewing appears. If at earlier stages of development the% of Tc1 positive offspring is higher, the authors might be assaying a selected population of carriers whose survival is contingent on a particular Tc1 epigenetic signature. The authors could resolve this point by genotyping pre-implantation embryos and/or haploid spermatids from Tc1 fathers. Using superovulated females crossed to the Tc1 males numerous embryos could be collected (morula or blastocyst stages) for genotyping using Tc1 chromosome PCR or FISH. Genotyping spermatids could be performed using Tc1 chromosome FISH.</p><p>2) The authors show that in Tc1 males apoptosis, revealed by caspase staining, occurs at meiotic metaphase I (stage XII of the epithelial cycle). To support their conclusion that this causes germ cell arrest, the authors should demonstrate that the numbers of metaphase I cells per tubule in Tc1 males at stage XII are elevated relative to controls (see Odorisio et al. Nat Gen. 1998 18:257 for methodology).</p><p>3) The ability to transmit Tc1 through males is surprising, and will be of interest to other groups struggling to perform similar experiments. The authors should comment on how they envisage this property arose in their stock. Is there evidence that the background strains used to maintain their lines exhibit weakened checkpoint mechanisms?</p><p>4) Although speculation about human meiosis is not necessarily warranted from this paper, the authors might consider if they can comment on chromosome transmission in people with Down syndrome.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20235.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>1) The authors did not examine the fate of the human chromosome after paternal or maternal inheritance following fertilization and zygotic gene activation.

Genotyping spermatids could be performed using Tc1 chromosome FISH.</italic> </p><p>This was an extremely interesting point that we addressed by characterizing the distribution and fate of the aneuploid human chromosome during spermatogenesis in Tc1 positive males. In sum, we found that a surprisingly high fraction (ca. 95%) of 4N spermatocytes have the aneuploid human chromosome, which is far higher than we (Wilson et al., 2008) or others (O’Doherty et al., 2005) have observed in the past for somatic tissues. Using FISH to genotype 1N spermatids revealed that there was a modest reduction (30% versus expected 50%) in the fraction containing HsChr21. We have added a paragraph (subsection “Efficient passage of a complete human chromosome through mouse male meiosis”, fourth paragraph) and supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) reporting these new results and indicating that this reduction only partially accounts for the much lower Tc1 chromosome transmission rate observed in males versus females. We now elaborate in the Discussion (fifth paragraph) that the balance of ‘missing’ aneuploid mice must disappear either from reduced fertility of the aneuploid 1N sperm or developmental failures of successful fertilizations prior to birth.</p><p><italic>2) The authors show that in Tc1 males apoptosis, revealed by caspase staining, occurs at meiotic metaphase I (stage XII of the epithelial cycle). To support their conclusion that this causes germ cell arrest, the authors should demonstrate that the numbers of metaphase I cells per tubule in Tc1 males at stage XII are elevated relative to controls (see Odorisio et al. Nat Gen. 1998 18:257 for methodology).</italic> </p><p>Following this recommendation, we have now performed extensive quantification of the different cell populations in seminiferous tubules of both Tc1 and wild-type mice, resulting in one new figure and one new Results section (see subsection “Tc1 males arrest at metaphase I and display chromosome congression defects” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with figure supplements 1 and 2).</p><p>We observe a consistent increase in the number of Stage XII tubules, as well as 4N spermatocytes and meiotic cells in Tc1 tubules compared to wild-types. This is consistent with an arrest at metaphase I, and a subsequent reduction of both round and elongating spermatids in Tc1 males, which we observed both in our immuno-fluorescence stainings as well as with FACS.</p><p>The manual classification of pro-metaphase and metaphase cells did not yield as strong results as described in Odorisio et al., however, we did observe a clear trend towards an increase of metaphase I cells in 3 out of the 5 inspected Tc1 males. The mice investigated by Odorisio et al. were completely sterile due to their arrest at metaphase I; in contrast, most Tc1 males were fertile and were thus not expected to show as strong a block at metaphase I. Interestingly, these experiments also revealed that congression defects occur more frequently in Tc1 tubules compared to wild-types. These lagging chromosomes would likely trigger the spindle assembly checkpoint, causing the block at metaphase I and thus increased apoptosis of Stage XII tubules.</p><p><italic>3) The ability to transmit Tc1 through males is surprising, and will be of interest to other groups struggling to perform similar experiments. The authors should comment on how they envisage this property arose in their stock. Is there evidence that the background strains used to maintain their lines exhibit weakened checkpoint mechanisms?</italic> </p><p>Our inquiries and literature searches have not identified published studies that directly address this issue. We ourselves have never attempted breeding setups in other genetic backgrounds, but have now added a section to the Discussion describing the breeding experiments performed by O’Doherty et al. (see Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><p>We have compared total testis RNAseq data from wildtype BL6 mice as well as our 129S8B6 F1 mice that we use for breeding with Tc1 animals to see whether there are any changes on the transcriptional level that could explain a weakened spindle checkpoint (Discussion, sixth paragraph). We observed only moderate changes between these two strains and GO analysis did not identify any mechanisms involved in meiotic control mechanisms. Amongst the spindle checkpoint genes we observed Septin2 to be differentially expressed, but only to a very modest extent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). While this could be an interesting candidate for future investigations given its previous implications in the control of metaphase-to-anaphase transition in female oocytes (Zhu et al., 2010), cell cycle control mechanisms usually go beyond transcriptional control. Therefore, little conclusions can be drawn from an increased expression level of this gene, as the crucial regulatory mechanisms could be post-translational.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20235.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20235.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20235.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-20235-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>4) Although speculation about human meiosis is not necessarily warranted from this paper, the authors might consider if they can comment on chromosome transmission in people with Down syndrome.</italic> </p><p>We have added a section in the Discussion comparing our gender ratios with the observed sex bias in human DS. While there is an increase in males with human DS, especially when the origin is paternal, the underlying mechanism has not been demonstrated. We do not observe such a bias in neither female or male germline transmission of the aneuploid chromosome and can therefore only state that the Tc1 model is not suitable to dissect the underlying mechanisms of the sex bias observed in human DS (see Discussion, seventh paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
