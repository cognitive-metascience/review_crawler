Consistent with previous electron and fluorescence microscopic studies, cofilin formed clusters along actin filaments, where the filaments were 2-nm thicker and the helical pitch was ∼25% shorter, compared to control filaments. Interestingly, the shortened helical pitch was propagated to the neighboring bare zone on the pointed-end side of the cluster, while the pitch on the barbed-end side was similar to the control. Thus, cofilin clusters induce distinctively asymmetric conformational changes in filaments. Consistent with the idea that cofilin favors actin structures with a shorter helical pitch, cofilin clusters grew unidirectionally toward the pointed-end of the filament. Severing was often observed near the boundaries between bare zones and clusters, but not necessarily at the boundaries.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04806.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04806.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04806.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Actin is one of the most abundant proteins found inside all eukaryotic cells including plant, animal, and fungal cells. This protein is involved in a wide range of biological processes that are essential for an organism's survival. Actin proteins form long filaments that help cells to maintain their shape and also provide the force required for cells to divide and/or move.</p><p>Actin filaments are helical in shape and are made up of many actin subunits joined together. Actin filaments are changeable structures that continuously grow and shrink as new actin subunits are added to or removed from the ends of the filaments. One end of an actin filament grows faster than the other; the fast-growing end is known as the barbed-end, while the slow-growing end is referred to as the pointed-end.</p><p>Over 100 other proteins are known to bind to and work with actin to regulate its roles in cells and how it forms into filaments. Cofilin is one such protein that binds to and forms clusters on actin filaments and it can also sever actin filaments. Severing an actin filament can encourage the filament to disassemble, or it can help produce new barbed ends that can then grow into new filaments. Previous work had suggested that cofilin severs actin filaments at the junction between regions on the filament that are coated with cofilin and those that are not. It was also known that cofilin binding to a filament causes the filament to change shape, and that the shape change is propagated to neighboring sections of the filaments not coated with cofilin. However, the details of where cofilin binds and how changes in shape are propagated along an actin filament were not known. Furthermore, the findings of these previous studies were largely based on examining still images of actin filaments, which are unlike the constantly changing filaments of living cells.</p><p>Ngo, Kodera et al. have now analyzed what happens when cofilin binds to and forms clusters along actin filaments using a recently developed imaging technique called high-speed atomic force microscopy. This technique can be used to directly visualize individual proteins in action. Consistent with previous findings, Ngo, Kodera et al. observed that filaments coated with cofilin are thicker than those filaments without cofilin; and that cofilin binding also substantially reduces the helical twist of the filament. Ngo, Kodera et al. also found that these changes in shape are propagated along the filament but in only one direction—towards the pointed-end. Moreover, cofilin clusters also only grew towards the pointed-end of the actin filament—and the filaments were often severed near, but not exactly at, the junctions between cofilin-coated and uncoated regions. Such one-directional changes in shape of the actin filaments presumably help to regulate how other actin binding proteins can interact with the filament and consequently regulate the roles of the filaments themselves.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04806.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04806.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>cofilin</kwd><kwd>cooperative conformational change</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Dictyostelium</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uyeda</surname><given-names>Taro QP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kodera</surname><given-names>Noriyuki</given-names></name><name><surname>Ando</surname><given-names>Toshio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cluster of cofilin along an otherwise bare actin filament induces distinctively asymmetric cooperative conformational changes to the filament on either side of the cluster.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Actin filaments are involved in a variety of important functions in eukaryotic cells, including muscle contraction, amoeboid movement, cytokinesis, intracellular transport, and transcriptional regulation within the nucleus. These diverse functions depend on the interaction between actin and specific actin binding proteins (ABPs), and it is generally assumed that specific biochemical signaling is involved in the spatial and temporal regulation of each actin–ABP interaction. During migration of amoeboid cells, for instance, cofilin plays essential roles in continuous extension of lamellipodia by severing actin filaments to promote filament depolymerization or to initiate polymerization from new barbed ends (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bravo-Cordero et al., 2013</xref>). Three independent biochemical mechanisms are known to inhibit cofilin activity; phosphorylation of Ser3, sequestration to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) in plasma membrane, and lower pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein and Bamburg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bravo-Cordero et al., 2013</xref>). These inhibitory mechanisms are implicated in the regulation of cofilin activity during cell migration, since experimental unleashing of inactive cofilin has been shown to initiate cofilin-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein and Bamburg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bravo-Cordero et al., 2013</xref>). Critically speaking, however, these data do demonstrate that active cofilin is required, but there is little experimental evidence that localized activation of cofilin is necessary for proper cofilin functions in cell migration. Indeed, overexpression of constitutively active S3A cofilin did not inhibit motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Popow-Wozniak et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, biochemical signaling is not sufficient to explain how cofilin activities are properly regulated spatially and temporally in cells.</p><p>On the other hand, many ABPs alter the atomic structure of actin subunits within filaments, and in certain cases these conformational changes are cooperative. For instance, the pioneering work of Oosawa and his colleagues demonstrated that the increase in fluorescence intensity of a fluorophore on actin saturates when only one molecule of the myosin motor domain is added for each 10 actin subunits within filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oosawa et al., 1973</xref>). Similar myosin-induced cooperative conformational changes have been detected in various other assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tawada, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujime and Ishiwata, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loscalzo et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miki et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prochniewicz et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, dense binding of cofilin shortens the helical pitch of actin filaments by 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGough et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galkin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>), and time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prochniewicz et al., 2005</xref>) and differential scanning calorimetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dedova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bobkov et al., 2006</xref>) showed that one molecule of bound cofilin changes the structure of ∼100 actin subunits within a filament. Moreover, binding of cofilin to actin filaments is cooperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hawkins et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayden et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGough et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De La Cruz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayakawa et al., 2014</xref>). This implies that cooperative conformational changes induced by an ABP are propagated to neighboring actin subunits, increasing their affinity for that, or another, ABP. This could provide a novel mechanism by which actin filaments change their function by regulating their affinities for various ABPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tokuraku et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michelot and Drubin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schoenenberger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Uyeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romet-Lemonne and Jegou, 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, the currently available information on structural changes to actin filaments is limited to high-resolution static images (electron microscopy), low-resolution dynamic changes (fluorescence microscopy), and bulk biochemical analyses. There is little information available in the molecular mechanism that mediates the propagation of structural changes to neighboring actin subunits. Atomic force microscope (AFM) is unique in that it enables detailed structural analysis of wet protein samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller and Dufrêne, 2008</xref>), and recent dramatic improvements in scanning speed now enables real time imaging of conformational changes in protein samples with high-spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ando et al., 2013</xref>). This high-speed AFM (HS-AFM) has been used to visualize molecular movements such as the stepping motion of myosin V along actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kodera et al., 2010</xref>), rotary catalysis of F<sub>1</sub> ATPase without a rotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Uchihashi et al., 2011</xref>), and light-induced conformational changes in bacteriorhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shibata et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we used HS-AFM to directly visualize conformational changes in actin filaments induced by cofilin binding. We found that conformational changes within cofilin clusters unidirectionally propagate to the neighboring bare actin zone in a cooperative manner and that the growth of the cofilin cluster follows this unidirectional cooperative conformational change.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Observation of actin filaments on a supported lipid bilayer</title><p>For AFM, actin filaments must be immobilized on the stage, yet they must have the freedom of movement to bind cofilin and exhibit the resultant changes in the helical twist that accompany cofilin binding.

These images were generated using Chimera software. When the true crossover point coincides with the position of an actin subunit (<bold>A</bold>) or a bound cofilin molecule (<bold>C</bold>), the position of the peak is equal to that of the crossover point, and its height is the tallest of the various possible orientations of the filament on the substrate. When the true crossover point is at the middle of two actin subunits (<bold>B</bold>) or two bound cofilin molecules (<bold>D</bold>), the peak height is the shortest of the possible orientations. In this latter case, the observed peak position is away from the true crossover point by as much as ∼2.5 nm. Depending on the orientation of the filament, therefore, the distance between the observed peak position and the true crossover point fluctuates between 0 and 2.5 nm. Random distribution of distances between the true crossover points and the highest points of the closest actin subunits would result in ±1.7 nm of error in the estimation of the positions of the true crossover points. If the peak positions at both ends of a half helix have this much error, the half helical pitch would have ±2.3 nm (±1.7 nm × √2) error. This is somewhat smaller than the ±3.0 nm standard deviation of the half helical pitches of actin filament paracrystals, and the difference should derive from small structural fluctuations in the paracrystals and/or measurement error from various other sources. In either case, it is safe to use the 3.0 nm standard deviation as the upper limit of the combined measurement errors and to estimate the lower limit of the structural fluctuations of control and cofilin-bound filaments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04806.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04806.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04806-fig1-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>We approximated the positions of the crossover points, where the two strands of actin filament are aligned vertically, using the position of the highest point (peak) in each half helix identified in the AFM images. Quantitative analysis indicated that the height of those peaks, or the thickness of the filaments, was 8.6 ± 0.8 nm (average ± SD), and the spacing between the peaks, or half helical pitch, was 36.8 ± 4.3 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). These values, which are consistent with previously reported structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanson and Lowy, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25a">Hanson, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egelman et al., 1982</xref>), will hereafter be referred to as normal height and normal half helical pitch, respectively. The distribution of half helical pitches ranged from ∼26 nm to ∼45 nm and was well fit by a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 4.3 nm. This distribution should reflect natural variation in half helical pitch, as was proposed on the basis of a similar distribution of half helical pitches in electron micrographs of negatively stained specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanson, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egelman et al., 1982</xref>) and also measurement errors. To assess the overall magnitude of the measurement errors, we prepared paracrystals of actin filaments in the presence of 30 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (Hanson, 1973). The distribution of the half helical pitches of the paracrystals measured under the same conditions was narrower than that of free filaments, with a mean of 36.5 nm and standard deviation of 3.0 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In a hypothetical case where the paracrystals do not undergo spontaneous conformational changes, this distribution is the upper limit of the measurement errors in our system. Furthermore, assuming normal distributions of the true half helical pitches and measurement errors, the true standard deviation of the half helical pitches of control filaments was calculated to be 3.1 nm or larger, by subtracting the variance of the actin paracrystals from that of control filaments. This indicated that the structure of the actin filaments does indeed vary with changes in helical twist.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Observation of actin filaments fully bound with cofilin</title><p>When 75 nM cofilin was added to actin filaments immobilized on the lipid surface, cofilin gradually bound to the actin filaments, and sections of filaments bound with cofilin molecules were easily identified, as the bound filaments appeared thicker and the peaks were taller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Peak heights within long cofilin clusters (longer than eight consecutive half helices) showed a single distribution of 10.6 nm ± 1.0 nm, approximately 2 nm taller than the control filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This is consistent with electron microscopic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galkin et al., 2011</xref>), which showed that filaments fully decorated with cofilin are ∼2.3-nm thicker than control filaments due to the presence of cofilin molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We therefore estimated the helical pitches on both sides of single rod-like structures sticking out from the filaments by measuring the filament length that encompassed three actin subunits along one strand on either side of the bound molecule. In addition, because we did not know the polarity of each filament, we compared the helical pitches on both sides by dividing the longer helical pitch by the shorter one. This yielded a value of 1.02 ± 0.02 (average ± SD, n = 9), which was much smaller than the 1.30 ± 0.18 (n = 4) measured for cofilin clusters in electron micrographs or 1.37 calculated from the AFM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and was comparable to the value of randomly selected regions along control actin filaments (1.04 ± 0.05, n = 18).

In most experiments we used 75 nM cofilin since we were able to observe de novo formation of clusters and tractable growth, after mixing and settling of the system. When 1 µM cofilin was added and mixed, we were unable to find bare zones of actin filaments. When actin filaments were incubated with 1 mM ADP and 10 mM Pi, much higher concentrations of cofilin (e.g., 900 nM) was needed to induce cofilin clusters. The growth rates of cofilin clusters were within tractable range even in the presence of 1 µM cofilin, when 10 mM Pi was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Severing also occurred in half helices in bare zones neighboring a cofilin cluster, which accounted for approximately 40% of severing events. Overall, ∼80% of the severing events occurred within one-half of a helix on either side of the boundary between a bare zone and a cofilin cluster. Severing in bare zones far from cofilin clusters was very rare.</p><p>In the presence of 40 nM cofilin, the lowest concentration we used for quantitative severing assay, we observed a total of 22 cases of severing events in 31 actin filaments.

Since our current analysis method only measures heights and distances between peaks, we were unable to examine if the supertwisted structure returns to a normal state abruptly or gradually. Also, we were unable to determine the positions of the ends of cofilin clusters precisely above the spatial resolution of half helices, making it difficult to estimate accurately how far the supertwisting conformational changes propagate into neighboring bare zones. Nonetheless, the fact that the pitches of the neighboring half helices second from the cofilin clusters were nearly normal suggests that the effect does not propagate longer than one-half of a helix.</p><p>The neighboring bare zone on the barbed-end side of the cluster had slightly longer helical pitch than the control. Although a <italic>t</italic>-test indicated that the untwisting was statistically significant, we are not certain if it was an active process. If interactions between actin filaments and the lipid surface produced resistive force against local rotation of the filament, supertwisting in the cluster would induce passive, compensating untwisting of the nearby helix. If that is the case, the fact that actin filaments are not necessarily free to rotate in vivo suggests similar passive untwisting may occur in vivo as well. In any case, it is noteworthy that cofilin clusters induced distinctly asymmetric cooperative conformational changes in neighboring bare zones. Propagation of the supertwisted conformation from cofilin clusters to neighbor bare zones had been suggested by image analysis of electron micrographs of cofilin–actin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galkin et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Growth of cofilin clusters is also unidirectional and independent on actin-bound nucleotides</title><p>Our observation that the cofilin clusters grew in the pointed-end direction supports the conclusion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galkin et al. (2001)</xref> that cofilin preferentially binds to the supertwisted segments of actin subunits. This tendency of cofilin clusters to grow unidirectionally was unaffected when most of the filament subunits carried ADP or ADP+Pi, demonstrating that the directional growth of cofilin clusters does not depend on a gradient of different nucleotide states on actin subunits within each filament. Instead, it presumably depends on asymmetric cofilin-induced conformational changes in the actin filaments, which is an intrinsic property of the polar structure of the actin filaments.</p><p>The rise of peaks and shortening of half helical pitches that accompanied the growth of cofilin clusters were sometimes rapid, but at other times slow and gradual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). If we assume that the rise was due to simple addition of cofilin molecules at the two binding sites closest to the crossover point, and if the cofilin clusters grow in perfect synchrony along two strands of the double helix, then the crossover points should rise abruptly in one step. If, on the other hand, there is a time-lag between cofilin bindings at the two critical binding sites, due to delayed growth along one strand, for example, the rise would occur in two smaller discrete substeps. Indeed, in many cases, the rise of peaks appeared to occur in two discrete substeps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), supporting this possibility. In other cases, however, the peaks rose gradually over the course of 40 s (e.g., P2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), although we have no mechanistic explanation for those events.</p><p>In certain cases the next peak (P1 in the case shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) only rose when the previous peak (P2) had reached a plateau, whereas in other cases the new peak (P2) started to rise while the previous one (P3) was still rising. This latter case is more consistent with the possibility that cofilin clusters do not necessarily grow in concert along the two strands, and the delay may sometimes exceed one-half of a helix.</p><p>Another uncertainty is whether the new cofilin molecule always binds to the vacant binding site immediately neighboring the cluster. If the unidirectional cluster growth to the pointed-end is driven by the shortened helical pitch on the pointed-end side of the cluster, the new molecule is likely to bind any of the vacant binding sites in the supertwisted, apparently, bare zone on the pointed-end side of the cluster. This view is consistent with the result of recent high-resolution single molecule fluorescence microscopic assays that showed that free cofilin molecules prefer to bind within 65 nm of an already bound cofilin molecule, but not necessarily to the site immediately neighboring the already bound molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayakawa et al., 2014</xref>). We thus speculate that there are vacant binding sites behind the advancing front of cofilin clusters, which are eventually filled by other cofilin molecules to form tight clusters, and that the advances are not necessarily in concert between the two strands of the double helix.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Severing</title><p>In the presence of cofilin, actin filaments are frequently severed at or near the boundary between cofilin clusters and bare zones, at least when examined at the spatial resolution of fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suarez et al., 2011</xref>). That observation is consistent with the idea that severing preferentially occurs at sites of structural discontinuity, such as the boundary between supertwisted and normal helical pitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michelot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De La Cruz, 2009</xref>). An alternative view is that cofilin binding weakens longitudinal contacts between actin subunits within cofilin clusters and also in neighboring bare zones, but because bound cofilin bridges two actin subunits, strengthening interactions between them, severing occurs in nearby supertwisted bare zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galkin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bobkov et al., 2002</xref>). Roughly 40% of the severing events in our AFM observations occurred at the boundary between a cluster and a bare zone or within the neighboring bare zone, which may be explained by these hypotheses. However, more than half of the severing events occurred within the cofilin clusters, albeit close to the cluster ends. One plausible explanation is that the scattered unoccupied cofilin binding sites near the ends of the cluster, discussed above, may be easy to break due to the lack of bridging cofilin molecules. Alternatively, if growth of cofilin clusters on one of the two filament strands lags the growth on the other, conformational stress may develop between the two strands, leading to breaks in the filament near the ends of cofilin clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>How many bound cofilin molecules are required for severing and cluster growth?</title><p>Previous biochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>) and simulation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De La Cruz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De La Cruz, 2009</xref>) suggested that one or a few bound cofilin molecules are sufficient to sever actin filaments. However, our AFM observations are more consistent with the view that efficient severing requires a cofilin cluster longer than one-half of a helix, since most of the severing events were observed within or very near cofilin clusters that were recognizable in our AFM images. The need of contiguously bound cofilin molecules for efficient severing is consistent with our earlier mutant analysis. Within filaments in solution, D11Q mutant actin subunits rapidly exchange bound ADP for ATP in solution. Consequently, most subunits within D11Q actin filaments have ATP bound, reducing their affinity for cofilin and protecting them from severing. Interestingly, cofilin was able to bind to copolymers of D11Q and wild-type actins, but severing was inefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Umeki et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that contiguous clusters of cofilin-bound actin subunits are necessary for efficient severing activity.</p><p>A related question is how many bound cofilin molecules are required to induce cooperative supertwisting conformational changes in actin filaments? Answering this question is technically difficult when the imaging power is not sufficient to see individual bound cofilin molecules, but our observations using a cofilin-rod fusion protein showed that one is not enough. Consistent with this view, previous simulation studies suggested that two cofilin molecules bound close to one another along an actin filament serve as a nucleus to initiate cooperative binding of cofilin to form a cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ressad et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanchoin and Pollard, 1999</xref>). Future high-resolution HS-AFM studies using cofilin fused with a rod or some other structural marker to make it visible with AFM will directly test those hypotheses.</p><p>Even if a singly bound cofilin molecule cannot induce supertwisting of the helix or initiate cluster growth, it does not exclude the possibility that single bound cofilin molecules induce subtler, perhaps longer range, cooperative conformational changes, such as those indirectly detected through biophysical measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dedova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prochniewicz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bobkov et al., 2006</xref>). Apparently cofilin is able to induce at least two distinct types of cooperative conformational changes: one that requires cluster formation, involves ∼25% supertwisting of the helix, and propagates over half a helix toward the pointed-end of the filament; and a second type that singly bound cofilin molecules can induce which involves relatively subtle conformational changes, and propagates much longer. Simulation studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15a">De La Cruz and Sept (2010)</xref> suggest that there are two distinct states of cofilin–actin complexes, which may be correlated with the two types of cooperative conformational changes we propose here.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Physiological implications of cofilin-induced unidirectional cooperative conformational changes in actin filaments</title><p>Cooperativity in the binding of cofilin to actin filaments could have multiple physiological implications. Generally speaking, cooperativity would amplify small changes in the input (concentration of active cofilin) to a larger difference in output (cluster formation and severing). In addition, the cellular concentration of cofilin is lower than that of polymerized actin, and cooperativity would be a useful means of disrupting selected filaments under those conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pollard et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Second, we propose that the propagation of cofilin-induced conformational changes into neighboring cofilin-unbound zones of actin filaments would give cofilin an advantage in competition with other ABPs, once a small cofilin cluster is established as a foothold. For example, cofilin is implicated in severing and depolymerization of aged actin filaments in lamellipodia. However, those actin filaments are often bound with tropomyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gunning et al., 2008</xref>), which inhibits binding of cofilin and protects the filaments from cofilin's severing and depolymerizing activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein and Bamburg, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ono and Ono, 2002</xref>). If cofilin forms a small cluster at a vacant site on an actin filament that is otherwise decorated and protected by tropomyosin, the cluster would induce, or apply conformational stress to induce, supertwisting on the neighboring tropomyosin-bound segment on the pointed-end side. This would accelerate dissociation of tropomyosin, resulting in faster growth of the cofilin cluster than when cluster growth needed to wait for spontaneous dissociation of neighboring tropomyosin molecules. Furthermore, that cluster growth is directed only to the pointed-end may be beneficial in selective disassembly of aged actin filaments.</p><p>Within cells, formin remains bound to the barbed-end when it catalyzes filament elongation. This causes relative rotation between the formin molecule and the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mizuno et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, if the formin molecule and the filament are not free to rotate, the filament will be untwisted, and if cofilin has a lower affinity for untwisted actin filaments, rapidly polymerizing actin filaments in a formin-dependent manner will be protected from severing by cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mizuno and Watanabe, 2012</xref>). It should be noted, however, that formin bound to the barbed-end of an actin filament also allosterically changes the structure of the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bugyi et al., 2006</xref>), which may interfere with the interactions of the filament with cofilin, independent of mechanically forced untwisting of the filament helix.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sharma et al. (2012)</xref> discovered that the untwisted conformation of actin filaments induced by a drebrin N-terminal fragment propagates to neighboring bare zones; however, their findings seem to indicate that this propagation is in both directions from the drebrin clusters, though the authors did not address that point. It thus appears that there are multiple forms of ABP-induced cooperative conformational changes to actin filaments that propagate into bare zones, which implies there are also multiple physiological functions for such cooperative conformational changes to actin filaments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Proteins</title><p>cDNA encoding human cofilin 1 was amplified from a human cDNA library using PCR with primers 5′-ggtaccatggcctccggtgt and 5′-tctagacaaaggcttgccctcca.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor), a guest Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Brad Nolen (Reviewing editor); Roberto Dominguez and Thomas Pollard (peer reviewers). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Here, Ngo et al., applied high-speed AFM to visualize interactions of cofilin with actin filaments. This method offers unprecedented resolution for studying the process in real time, so there is no question about the technical advance over previous methods. They show that cofilin forms clusters along actin filaments and discovered that the shortened helical pitch propagates to the neighboring 'cofilin-free' zone towards the filament pointed end. Furthermore, they demonstrate that cofilin clusters grew unidirectionally towards the filament pointed end. Finally, they show that severing most frequently occurs within the cofilin clusters (&gt;50%), while 1/3 of severing events were observed to occur near these clusters. Because of the critical importance of cofilin severing in nearly all actin cytoskeleton activities, these findings have general relevance and interest for the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, additional experiments are required to support the authors' conclusions:</p><p>1) Control experiments are needed to validate the cofilin constructs used. Specifically, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>, should be replotted as binding density versus free cofilin, and the figure should include binding isotherms for wild type cofilin, both with His-tag cleaved and with His tag uncleaved. The authors should indicate the molar concentrations of components used instead of the ratios in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> and show a control with cofilin-rod alone at the maximum concentration used in the assay to show that this protein is not sedimenting on its own. The authors also should clarify why at 1:1, there is more actin in the supernatant than in the pellet, and then at 2:1 most of the actin goes back to being in the pellet.</p><p>2) The authors should repeat experiments done with a mix of Pi and ATP with only Pi. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>, adding Pi is reasonable, because it will result in ADP-Pi -bound subunits. However, there is no reason to add ATP because the bound nucleotide does not exchange on polymerized actin, and addition of ATP makes it impossible to determine the orientation of filaments since ATP dissociates S1. Therefore, the authors should repeat this experiment with Pi and no ATP, so that S1 decoration and filament orientation can be determined. In addition, the authors should clarify the issue of the nucleotide state of the filament throughout the manuscript, including in setting up the rationale for the experiments and in the interpretation of the results. For example, in the Discussion section, the authors state that “This tendency of cofilin clusters to grow unidirectionally was unaffected when most of the filament subunits carried ADP or either ATP or ADP+Pi”, but the filaments would not have bound ATP under any of the conditions that they tested.</p><p>3) The authors should explicitly specify in the figure legends the concentrations of cofilin used in the severing assay. If the concentrations are not at or near the optimal severing concentration for cofilin (Andrianantoandro, 2006), the severing experiments should be repeated at the optimal concentration. In addition, severing data should also be more precisely analyzed to indicate where severing occurs. The new analysis should allow the authors to make statements about where within the cluster severing is occurring (e.g. closer to the ends or evenly distributed throughout the clusters). The authors should also clarify how many severing events were analyzed (i.e. does the 'frequency' correspond to absolute numbers of the severing events?). Disagreement with previous severing models/results should be more clearly addressed.</p><p>The authors should also address the following issues in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) The strategy for the alpha-actinin-cofilin fusion construct should be better explained. Please be more specific about the region of alpha-actinin that was fused (what is meant by “half of an a-actinin rod”?) State what amino acid numbers were used.

Specifically, the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 2</italic></xref><italic>, should be replotted as binding density versus free cofilin, and the figure should include binding isotherms for wild type cofilin, both with His-tag cleaved and with His tag uncleaved. The authors should indicate the molar concentrations of components used instead of the ratios in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>and show a control with cofilin-rod alone at the maximum concentration used in the assay to show that this protein is not sedimenting on its own. The authors also should clarify why at 1:1, there is more actin in the supernatant than in the pellet, and then at 2:1 most of the actin goes back to being in the pellet</italic>.</p><p>According to this suggestion, we repeated cosedimentation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) and replotted the data on cofilin with and without His tag as a function of free cofilin concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>). It is evident that both cofilin with and without His tag and cofilin-rod with and without His tag do not sediment on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>). Cofilin with and without His tag appeared to have slightly different affinities for actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>), but we did not pursue that issue further, since that is not a main topic of this paper.</p><p>In the first version, the 1:1 data point was strange, which was because we loaded that pair of supernatant and pellet in a wrong order. We apologize for not mentioning that in the original manuscript, which confused the reviewers.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should repeat experiments done with a mix of Pi and ATP with only Pi. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5"><italic>Figures 4 and 5</italic></xref><italic>, adding Pi is reasonable, because it will result in ADP-Pi -bound subunits. However, there is no reason to add ATP because the bound nucleotide does not exchange on polymerized actin, and addition of ATP makes it impossible to determine the orientation of filaments since ATP dissociates S1. Therefore, the authors should repeat this experiment with Pi and no ATP, so that S1 decoration and filament orientation can be determined. In addition, the authors should clarify the issue of the nucleotide state of the filament throughout the manuscript, including in setting up the rationale for the experiments and in the interpretation of the results. For example, in the Discussion section, the authors state that “This tendency of cofilin clusters to grow unidirectionally was unaffected when most of the filament subunits carried ADP or either ATP or ADP+Pi”, but the filaments would not have bound ATP under any of the conditions that they tested</italic>.</p><p>Based on this constructive comment, we observed growth of cofilin clusters in the presence of ADP and 10 mM Pi, but no ATP. The results were clear, enabling us to conclude that the clusters grew unidirectionally to the P-ends regardless of the nucleotide states of actin subunits. We have thus replaced the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> with this new set of data.</p><p>In addition, we have re-examined the nucleotide states of actin subunits during the experiments, and made revisions accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should explicitly specify in the figure legends the concentrations of cofilin used in the severing assay. If the concentrations are not at or near the optimal severing concentration for cofilin (Andrianantoandro, 2006), the severing experiments should be repeated at the optimal concentration. In addition, severing data should also be more precisely analyzed to indicate where severing occurs. The new analysis should allow the authors to make statements about where within the cluster severing is occurring (e.g. closer to the ends or evenly distributed throughout the clusters). The authors should also clarify how many severing events were analyzed (i.e. does the 'frequency' correspond to absolute numbers of the severing events?). Disagreement with previous severing models/results should be more clearly addressed</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for failing to specify the concentrations of cofilin used in the severing assays. It was 75 nM, and it is now written in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. 75 nM is significantly higher than that reported to be optimum by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref> (10 nM), and therefore, we observed severing in the presence of lower concentrations, down to 10 nM. However, we did not detect severing in the presence of 10 cofilin, and only very infrequently in 20 nM. In the presence of cofilin higher than 500 nM, binding was so rapid that it was difficult to follow the growth of cofilin clusters even by HS-AFM, but we did confirm that severing is very infrequent in the presence of 500 nM cofilin and almost not at all in 1 µM. Thus, we also found that intermediate concentrations of cofilin (around 40-200 nM) are optimum for severing, although we do not have quantitative data. This is qualitatively consistent with Andrianantoandro and Pollard’s finding. However, our optimum concentrations are higher by several-fold, and we can only speculate that this discrepancy may be due to differences in experimental conditions. In Andrianantoandro’s experiments, actin filaments were immobilized by small number of NEM-myosin molecules, while in our experiments, actin filaments were attracted to the positively charged lipid membrane. Furthermore, in Andrianantoandro’s experiments, actin filaments were chemically labeled with fluorophores. All these may affect the state of actin filaments in different manners. In addition, movements of actin filaments are more or less restricted to two-dimension on the lipid surface under our conditions. Furthermore, Andrianantoandro reported that the severing activity is dependent on filament length, and it is plausible that our filaments were shorter than Andrianantoandro’s.</p><p>We have also performed a more careful analysis of severing position with respect to the cofilin clusters (in the Discussion section), which supports our original conclusion that severing occurs primarily near the boundary of cofilin clusters and bare zones, but not deeper inside the clusters or in bare zones far from clusters.</p><p>Regarding the number of severing events, the numbers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> are the number of events. To make this point clear, we relabeled the x-axis as “Number of events” instead of “Frequency”.</p><p>At 40 nM cofilin, we did observe infrequent severing (N=22). In the majority of the cases, we detected a short cofilin cluster near the severing site. This finding strongly supports our conclusion that cofilin clusters, but not singly or sparsely bound cofilin molecules, accelerate severing of the filaments. This point is now highlighted in the Discussion section, referring to contradictory earlier reports including that by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrianantoandro and Pollard (2006)</xref>.</p><p><italic>The authors should also address the following issues in the revised manuscript</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The strategy for the alpha-actinin-cofilin fusion construct should be better explained. Please be more specific about the region of alpha-actinin that was fused (what is meant by “half of an a-actinin rod”?) State what amino acid numbers were used. Cite literature that supports the argument that the construct used will form a 6 angstrom long rod. Also, please address the possibility that the fusion protein could possibly form antiparallel dimers via spectrin repeat interactions</italic>.</p><p>We have added a more detailed description on the actinin-rod to the Materials and methods section, including references for the monomeric nature and the length of the rod. The references are also cited in the main text. In addition, we wrote erroneously that the rod is ∼6 nm long in the original manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The observation that the conformational change in the filament spreads asymmetrically is an important result but is unexpected based on thermodynamic considerations. The authors are encouraged to repeat the analysis of this data using a blinded observer</italic>.</p><p>We had two researchers not involved in this study judging the polarity of the filament based on the appearance of transiently bound S1 molecules. In all of the cases tested, their judgment agreed with the original judgment.</p><p><italic>3) The extent of the propagation of the supertwisted conformation from a cofilin cluster to the neighboring bare zone at the pointed end should be precisely described. How many repeats become supertwisted after a cofilin cluster? Also, is this a structural effect that decreases gradually or abruptly? The authors are encouraged to quantitatively address these questions</italic>.</p><p>We have measured half helical pitches of the neighbors second from the cofilin clusters, and found that they were nearly normal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Unfortunately, our current measurement algorithm only allows for the measurement of half helical pitches between peaks. It is also impossible to determine where exactly the cofilin cluster ends. For those two reasons, it is difficult to obtain more detailed information about how far the conformational change propagates into neighboring bare zones and whether the structural effect decreases abruptly or gradually. However, the fact that the second neighboring bare zone had almost the normal pitch length seems to suggest that the length of supertwisted neighboring bare zone is shorter than one half helix. This speculation is added in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
