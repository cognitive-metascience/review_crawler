tissue morphogenesis. A central feature of actin dynamics is the capacity of filaments to polymerize and depolymerize at their ends in response to cellular conditions. It is currently thought that filament kinetics can be described by a single rate constant for each end. In this study, using direct visualization of single actin filament elongation, we show that actin polymerization kinetics at both filament ends are strongly influenced by the binding of proteins to the lateral filament surface. We also show that the pointed-end has a non-elongating state that dominates the observed filament kinetic asymmetry. Estimates of flexibility as well as effects on fragmentation and growth suggest that the observed kinetic diversity arises from structural alteration. Tuning elongation kinetics by exploiting the malleability of the filament structure may be a ubiquitous mechanism to generate a rich variety of cellular actin dynamics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04599.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04599.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04599.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in cells. It forms networks of filaments that provide structural support and generate the forces needed for cell movement, division, and many other processes in cells.</p><p>Filaments of actin continuously change in length as actin molecules are added or removed at the ends. One end of an actin filament—called the barbed-end—grows much faster than the other, known as the pointed-end. Many other proteins also help the actin filaments to form. Some of these proteins bind to the ends of the filaments, where they directly control the growth of the filaments. Other proteins bind along the length of the filaments, but how these ‘side-binding’ proteins influence the growth of filaments is not clear.</p><p>In this study, Crevenna et al. used a technique called ‘total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy’ to study how several side-binding proteins affect the growth of actin filaments in an artificial system. The growth of the barbed-ends was strongly influenced by which side-binding protein was interacting with the filament. For example, the barbed-end grew rapidly when a protein called VASP was present but grew more slowly in the presence of the protein α-actinin. Although the growth at the pointed-end was generally slow and sporadic, the side-binding proteins also had noticeable effects.</p><p>Crevenna et al. found that when the side-binding proteins were present at low levels, filament growth was similar for all proteins studied. It was only when the proteins were present at higher levels that the growth of the actin filaments was altered depending on the specific side-binding protein present. One side-binding protein called α-actinin also altered the shape of the actin filament so that when it was present at high levels, the filaments curved in a particular direction. Together, these results suggest that the growth, structure, and flexibility of actin filaments can be strongly influenced by the various proteins that bind along the length of the filaments.</p><p>The next challenges are to understand the precise details of how these side-binding proteins are able to alter the growth and shape of actin and investigate how they influence other processes that control the structure of actin networks in cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04599.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04599.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>treadmilling</kwd><kwd>actin-binding protein</kwd><kwd>TIRF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wedlich-Söldner</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamb</surname><given-names>Don C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lange</surname><given-names>Oliver F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CONACYT DAAD- A/09/7253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arciniega</surname><given-names>Marcelino</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The kinetics of actin polymerization are strongly influenced by the binding of proteins to the lateral filament surface.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central cellular processes such as cell migration, cytokinesis, endocytosis, and mechanosensation depend critically on actin-based force generation and actin filament turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lecuit et al., 2011</xref>). The molecular basis of actin filament turnover derives from the association and dissociation of monomers from each filament end and depends on the nucleotide (ATP, ADP · Pi, or ADP) bound to the actin monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>). The filament is kinetically asymmetric, where one end (called the barbed-end) is observed to grow an order of magnitude faster than the other end (the pointed-end) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>). In addition, the critical concentration for polymerization is different for the two ends. The origin of the asymmetry is not fully understood. Measurements of filament elongation as a function of solution viscosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drenckhahn and Pollard, 1986</xref>) and particle-analysis from cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narita et al., 2011</xref>) suggest the existence of a non-elongating state at the pointed-end. Although growth pauses have been previously observed during filament elongation measured using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuhn and Pollard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujiwara et al., 2007</xref>), these pauses were attributed to artifacts and were not characterized further. The dynamics of the pointed-end plays an important role in both the origin of the differences in critical concentration observed at the two ends in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujiwara et al., 2007</xref>); and in filament treadmilling, where, barbed-end growth and pointed-end shrinking occur simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bugyi and Carlier, 2010</xref>). Thus, we have focused on performing an accurate and detailed analysis of both barbed-end and pointed-end dynamics using TIRF microscopy.</p><p>In cells, a large number of proteins interact with actin filaments, either at the ends or with the lattice. End-binding proteins regulate actin dynamics by limiting elongation (at the barbed-end) or serving as anchor points (for the pointed-end). Side-binding proteins, on the other hand, are much more diverse encompassing myosin motors, cross-linkers or bundlers as well as severing proteins. The interaction of the actin filament with a particular subset of proteins defines the molecular composition, architecture, and overall turnover of sub-cellular arrays such as stress fibers and filopodia. Some of these arrays are tightly packed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jasnin et al., 2013</xref>) and dynamics of the filaments are influenced by the local environment. The mechanisms of how some proteins are recruited to these structures while others are excluded are a subject of intense research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>). Although the overall filament dynamics have been thought to be sensitive to the concentration of the side-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breitsprecher et al., 2009</xref>), it is not understood how and to what extent side-binding proteins alter filament kinetics, structure, and flexibility.</p><p>In this study, we used TIRF microscopy to study the effect of side-binding proteins on the dynamics of actin filament growth in vitro. We chose three cross-linking proteins and one motor protein to represent the large variety of interacting proteins and used them to tether filaments directly to the surface of a glass slide for visualization. We used the chemically inactivated myosin II motor protein (NEM-myosin) as it is the standard choice for this type of assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuhn and Pollard, 2005</xref>). The filamin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kueh et al., 2008</xref>) was used, which is an important player in cellular mechanosensing that is evolutionary-conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Razinia et al., 2012</xref>), as its use as a tether has recently generated some debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mullins, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niedermayer et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, we selected α-actinin, a molecule that, together with myosin II, forms stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langanger et al., 1986</xref>), and VASP, a protein that localizes to areas of dynamic actin reorganization such as filopodia and the lamelipodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rottner et al., 1999</xref>). By carrying out these assays with several proteins that bind to the side of actin filaments, we were able to explore the possible range of modulation available to actin filament dynamics and delineate intrinsic filament properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kinetic modulation at the barbed-end</title><p>Fluorescently labeled actin was used to visualize the growth of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) using TIRF microscopy.

The elongation velocity ‘<italic>E</italic>’ at the barbed-end was the fastest with VASP and the slowest with α-actinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By varying the free actin concentration from 0.3 to 2 μM, we estimated the barbed-end association and dissociation rates, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), using only the periods of elongation (i.e., E &gt; 1.5 sub·s<sup>−1</sup>, referred to hereafter as the ‘kinetically active’ phases). Compared to the previously reported value of 11.6 sub·μM<sup>−1</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup> for actin only in the absence of tethering proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>), we found a higher value of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> in the presence of VASP, a similar value for actin alone and for NEM-myosin, and lower values when α-actinin or filamin were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Extrapolating the elongation velocity as a function of actin concentration to zero actin provides an estimate of the dissociation rate, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>, of ATP-actin at the barbed-end (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In the presence of filamin, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> is indistinguishable from zero, whereas in the presence of VASP, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> increased compared to the value in the presence of NEM-myosin (1.6 ± 0.5 s<sup>−1</sup>). The estimated <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> we measured in the presence of NEM-myosin was in agreement with the previously reported value of 1.4 s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>), whereas in the presence of α-actinin, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> was lower than 1.4 s<sup>−1</sup>. The ratio of inferred dissociation rates to the calculated association rate (i.e., <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub>) is the critical concentration at which polymerization will occur and has been estimated to be ∼150 nM for the barbed-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>). We find a similar value (∼0.2 μM) for filaments elongated in the presence of VASP, α-actinin and NEM-myosin, but close to zero for filamin. The use of VASP induced the largest change in the measured kinetics. In contrast to the other three proteins measured, the kinetics were enhanced. VASP is known to act as a polymerase at the barbed-end by delivering subunits to the growing end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</xref>). It achieves this function through its two actin-binding domains: a G-actin-binding domain that delivers monomers (via G-actin binding or GAB domain) while remaining attached to the filament via the F-actin-binding or FAB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>). To rule out the polymerase activity of VASP as the cause of enhanced kinetics, we also tested a VASP construct that lacks the GAB domain but retains its capacity to interact with the filament lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</xref>). We continued to observe fast polymerization using this VASP-ΔGAB protein as a tether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</xref>). The measured kinetic rates were 70 ± 30 sub·μM<sup>−1</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup> for <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> and 14 ± 9 s<sup>−1</sup> for <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>, about half of those determined using the full-length VASP construct. Therefore, the effect of immobilized VASP on filament kinetics is not only due to recruitment of monomers to the growing filament. These results demonstrate that ATP-actin kinetics at the barbed-end are sensitive to the particular side-binding protein interacting with the filament.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04599.005</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Rate constants of Mg-ATP-actin monomer association and dissociation at both ends of the actin filament in the absence and presence of side-binding proteins</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04599.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04599.005</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>End</th><th><italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> (sub·μM<sup>−1</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup>)</th><th><italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> (sub·s<sup>−1</sup>)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2"><sup>†</sup></xref></th><th><italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> (μM)</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>actin alone</td><td>Barbed</td><td>11.6 ± 1.2</td><td>1.4 ± 0.8</td><td>0.12 ± 0.07</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Pointed</td><td>1.3 ± 0.2</td><td>0.8 ± 0.3</td><td>0.6 ± 0.17</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Barbed</td><td>9.7 ± 2<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></td><td>1 ± 0.3</td><td>0.1 ± 0.04</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Pointed</td><td>2.1 ± 0.8</td><td>0.8 ± 0.4</td><td>0.4 ± 0.35</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td>Surface adsorbed</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> NEM-myosin</td><td>Barbed</td><td>11 ± 1</td><td>1.6 ± 0.7</td><td>0.15 ± 0.03</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Pointed</td><td>0.8 ± 0.1</td><td>0.4 ± 0.1</td><td>0.5 ± 0.2</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>Dd</italic> VASP</td><td>Barbed</td><td>120 ± 30</td><td>1 ± 3</td><td>0.01 ± 0.03</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Pointed</td><td>48 ± 10</td><td>0.5 ± 2</td><td>0.01 ± 0.05</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td> filamin</td><td>Barbed</td><td>8.5 ± 1.3</td><td>0.1 ± 0.4</td><td>0.012 ± 0.002</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Pointed</td><td>5.3 ± 0.1</td><td>2.6 ± 0.2</td><td>0.5 ± 0.04</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td> α-actinin</td><td>Barbed</td><td>7.7 ± 1.5</td><td>0.7 ± 1</td><td>0.1 ± 0.2</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Pointed</td><td>0.9 ± 0.3</td><td>0.9 ± 0.3</td><td>1 ± 1</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>Dd</italic> VASP ΔGAB</td><td>Barbed</td><td>70 ± 13</td><td>14 ± 9</td><td>0.2 ± 0.2</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Pointed</td><td>16 ± 12</td><td>5 ± 8</td><td>0.3 ± 0.2</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td>In solution</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> <italic>Dd</italic> VASP</td><td>Barbed</td><td>126 ± 30</td><td>43 ± 33</td><td>0.3 ± 0.2</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Pointed</td><td>12 ± 8</td><td>3 ± 8</td><td>0.3 ± 2</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td> filamin</td><td>Barbed</td><td>8.6 ± 1.1</td><td>−1.3 ± 2</td><td>0.0 ± 0.1</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Pointed</td><td>5.5 ± 1.5</td><td>2.8 ± 1.6</td><td>0.5 ± 0.4</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>Dd</italic> VASP ΔGAB</td><td>Barbed</td><td>24 ± 11</td><td>4 ± 15</td><td>0.2 ± 1</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Pointed</td><td>3 ± 2.5</td><td>0.5 ± 4.5</td><td>0.2 ± 7</td><td>this work</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>Hs</italic> VASP</td><td>Barbed</td><td>24 ± 4</td><td>−3 ± 5</td><td>0 ± 0.1</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Pointed</td><td>Not reported</td><td>Not reported</td><td>Not reported</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>*</label><p>All reported errors from this work are 95% confidence intervals whereas those of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>) represent SD.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><label>†</label><p>All reported dissociation constants from this work are inferred from extrapolation of the elongation velocity as a function of actin concentration to zero concentration, data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig4">Figures 1, 2 and 4</xref>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Kinetic modulation at the pointed-end</title><p>Pointed-end association and dissociation rates were estimated in the same manner as those for the barbed-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Such kinetically inactive phases were observed for all free actin concentrations tested (250 nM–2 μM). Above the pointed-end critical concentration (e.g., using a free actin concentration of 1 μM), we observed a discontinuous (i.e., growth-pause) behavior for all side-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the presence of VASP or filamin, pointed-end elongation was readily observed. Pointed-end elongation was much more difficult to visualize when using NEM-myosin and α-actinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) where elongation occurred for brief periods of time and with slower rates. The elongation velocity during kinetically active phases was influenced strongly by the different tethering proteins used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Elongation velocity followed the order of VASP &gt; VASP ΔGAB &gt; filamin &gt; α-actinin &gt; NEM-myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). On the other hand, at 300 nM free actin monomer concentration, i.e., below the pointed-end critical concentration of ∼600 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>), we observed barbed-end growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and pointed-end depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), i.e., treadmilling, in the presence of filamin as a tethering protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Treadmilling was also present using NEM-myosin and α-actinin, albeit with slower rates, since pointed-end depolymerization establishes the overall treadmilling rate. In contrast to our expectations, there was no shrinkage at the pointed-end below the critical concentration but polymerization in the presence of VASP or VASP ΔGAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results suggest that side-binding proteins can also determine actin filament pointed-end growth and depolymerization dynamics. Additionally, these results show that observed effects at one end do not necessarily represent effects at both ends. For example, filamin reduces only the dissociation rate (and therefore the critical concentration) at the barbed-end although it alters both the association and dissociation rate at the pointed-end.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The elongation rate varies with occupancy of the side-binding proteins</title><p>Next, we studied how sensitive filament dynamics are to the presence of each of the proteins tested. Therefore, we measured the elongation rates and pausing as a function of the side-binding protein surface density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For this, we varied the total protein concentration that was allowed to adsorb to the glass surface, therefore changing the number of tethering proteins that interact with a single filament. We estimated the lattice-binding protein surface density from the protein concentration, the sample volume (∼10 μL) and the surface to which the sample was adsorbed (a flow cell of 5 mm × 20 mm, giving 100 mm<sup>2</sup>) as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Howard et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crevenna et al., 2008</xref>). All protein in solution was assumed to adsorb on the upper and lower glass surfaces. To achieve consecutive lower tether densities, the total protein concentration was serially diluted. At low tethering protein concentrations, individual filaments swiveled around distinctive attachment points indicating that they are bound to single tethering molecules as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Howard et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crevenna et al., 2008</xref>). To estimate the density in an alternative manner, we measured the average number of pivot points per micron of filament at the two lowest protein concentrations and divided that by the average area covered during swiveling. Assuming a linear scaling with protein concentration, this estimate results in a lower density (by a factor of 2) compared to those reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and throughout the text. Estimated densities ranged from ∼5 up to ∼18,000 molecules·μm<sup>−2</sup>, which are equivalent to values between 0.1 and 110 tethers per micron of filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04599.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Barbed-end actin filament elongation as a function of the surface density of side-binding proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) The change in length, Δ<italic>L</italic>, of actin filaments as a function of time when using filamin as the surface tethering protein at the (<bold>A</bold>) lowest (5.9 molecules/μm<sup>2</sup> or 0.03 molecules per micron of filament) or (<bold>B</bold>) the highest (5900 molecules/μm<sup>2</sup> or 35 molecules per micron of filament) density.

As an example, filamin is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>. Elongating actin filaments (at a free actin monomer concentration of 1 μM) showed mostly kinetically active phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and the elongation velocity distributions were centered around ∼9 subunits·s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). At high tether densities (600–18,000 μm<sup>−2</sup> or 3–110 molecules per micron of filament), each side-binding protein tested generated a particular elongation behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using filamin, increasing the surface tether density decreased the mean elongation velocity of kinetically active phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>) and increased the fraction of time the filament spent in a paused state, i.e., the pausing probability ‘<italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub>’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D,F</xref>). In contrast, increasing the VASP or the VASP-ΔGAB density increased the elongation velocity while VASP also increased the <italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Higher surface concentrations of α-actinin or NEM-myosin had also an effect on the elongation velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and, in addition, the density of NEM-myosin had a strong effect on the <italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>One possible explanation for these results could be geometric and/or mechanical constrains imposed on the filament by the high density of the surface-immobilized side-binding protein used. To investigate this possibility, we carried out experiments where a very low density of NEM-myosin was used to tether filaments to the surface while a second, side-binding protein was present in solution. We tested the effects of VASP, VASP-ΔGAB, and filamin on filament growth. The influence of all three side-binding proteins on the elongation rate of both the barbed- and pointed-end were similar to what we observed when using them to immobilize the actin filaments to the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

These results suggest that a variety of elongation kinetics can arise from the specific interaction of actin filaments with the particular associated side-binding protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Intrinsic filament dynamics</title><p>To further verify that the observed kinetic changes and pauses originate from the particular side-binding protein used as a tether, we investigated the intrinsic properties of filament elongation and controlled for artifacts. Single elongating filaments were measured at the lowest protein surface density possible that still allowed filament visualization. At the lowest α-actinin tether density used (5 molecules μm<sup>−2</sup>, which corresponds to 1 tether molecule every 5–10 microns along the filament), the ends swiveled around their tethering site due to Brownian motion and were clearly free of the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Under these conditions, barbed-ends showed continuous elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) while pointed-ends were typically in the kinetically inactive state (only 2 of 50 filaments showed growth or depolymerization, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). For the other tethering proteins, only the paused state was observed on freely swiveling pointed-ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using only the pause-free elongation velocities for each actin concentration tested, we estimated association and dissociation rates (slopes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Our estimated values for the pause-free elongation kinetics agree well with those previously obtained by EM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), which were measured on the 20–60 s time scale. When we convolute our pointed-end pause-free elongation rate with the pausing probability, our results are comparable to the kinetics estimated by TIRF experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuhn and Pollard, 2005</xref>). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that continuous pointed-end growth occurs at the beginning of filament assembly, which is suggested from our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and is the time scale on which the EM data was acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>).

Another possible source of pauses is light-induced photo-dimerization. From the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niedermayer et al. (2012)</xref>, it is possible to quantitatively predict the accumulated fraction of filaments where depolymerization has been paused as a consequence of exposure to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast with this prediction, we observed all swiveling filament pointed-ends, under depolymerizing conditions, to be in a kinetically inactive state at the beginning of image acquisition (N = 40, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Only in the presence of a medium to high density of tethering proteins did we observe depolyermization of pointed-ends (12 of 55, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>As an additional test to rule out any tether, surface or light-induced effect of the pausing, we used a two-color solution assay to investigate pointed-end growth. Here, a small seed (formed with atto565-labeled actin) was allowed to grow in solution for 15 min in the presence of atto488-labeled monomers, followed by stabilization, dilution, and visualization of the filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). At a free actin concentration of 1 μM, the concentration used in solution to allow filament elongation, all pointed-ends are expected to grow at an average rate of ∼0.5 sub/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard, 1986</xref>). In contrast to this expectation, we observed that only 20% of the seeds grew at the pointed-end (N = 1000, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). This percentage is higher than we observe in the surface-based experiments, which could be due to annealing of filaments in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sept et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrianantoandro et al., 2001</xref>) or due to lack of the tethering protein. What is clear is that the non-elongating or paused state is not due to either surface or light-induced effects. Taken together, these results show that a single rate constant describes filament elongation kinetics from ATP-monomers in the absence of side-binding proteins and that the pointed-end has an intrinsic kinetically inactive state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Structural effects of side-binding proteins on filaments</title><p>During the course of filament elongation analysis as a function of side-binding protein density on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we noticed that filaments appeared more bent as the tether density increased.

We also tested the mechanical effect of the side binding proteins on the actin filament when the actin filaments were attached to the surface with a low density of NEM-myosin and the side-binding protein was present in solution.

Second, barbed-end elongation when tethered with α-actinin had a preference to grow in a counterclockwise direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This counterclockwise elongation observed when α-actinin was present was independent of the length the filament had when it landed on the surface.

We hypothesize that structural alteration might be the origin of kinetic modulation. To test how well this interpretation could explain our results, we constructed a simple model based on long-range structural alterations to describe elongation as a function of tether density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In our model, the interaction between a growing filament and a tethering protein gives rise to a modified association rate (i.e., <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) at the site of interaction, which then propagates over a certain distance <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). From the interaction site, there is a linear decay of the modified association rate, as a linear decay would be expected for the release of torsional stress. Using a Monte Carlo method (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details), we calculated <italic>α</italic> and <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub> (which are the only free parameters) by comparing the simulated elongation rates to the experimental values and minimizing the χ<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

We propose that the existing discrepancy in estimated critical concentrations at both ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujiwara et al., 2007</xref>) originates from the presence of a previously uncharacterized kinetically inactive or non-elongating state at the pointed-end. This kinetically inactive state is consistent with a non-elongating structural conformation observed by cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narita et al., 2011</xref>). The kinetic asymmetry of the pure actin filament may be low (∼3) and such non-elongating or closed conformation at the pointed-end would reinforce the effective filament asymmetry. The transition at the pointed-end from the open to the closed state may be coupled to ATP hydrolysis or phosphate release at the terminal subunit. The presence of this open-to-closed transition at the pointed-end would explain why the terminal subunit has an estimated different rate of phosphate release compared to the filament lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujiwara et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Actin filaments in association with any of the five proteins tested displayed a change in elongation velocity, an increase in pausing, and a change in filament flexibility. Therefore, it is possible that these three characteristics have a common origin. For three of these filament-binding proteins (myosin, α-actinin, and filamin), the binding interface to the actin filament is formed by two consecutive monomers along the same strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galkin et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lorenz and Holmes, 2010</xref>). These side-binding proteins might directly occlude the binding site for the next monomer either partially (reducing the elongation velocity) or completely (giving rise to an elongation pause). Partial distortion of the filament could turn into a defect that propagates along the lattice decreasing the observed filament stiffness and impacting the association rate. In this respect, side-binding proteins could be thought of as allosteric regulators of actin filament kinetics. Indeed, actin filaments are known to be subject to allosteric regulation by other associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egelman and Orlova, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galkin et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prochniewicz and Thomas, 1997</xref>), cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galkin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prochniewicz et al., 2005</xref>), dystrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prochniewicz et al., 2009</xref>), and utrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prochniewicz et al., 2009</xref>) are known to induce structural changes in the actin filament. Similar to filamin and α-actinin, dystrophin and utrophin bind actin through calponin-homology (CH) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galkin et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, binding to the filament is cooperative for cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De La Cruz, 2005</xref>), αE-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>), and myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orlova and Egelman, 1997</xref>). The basis for this allosteric regulation could originate from the stabilization of an existing structural state of the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galkin et al., 2001</xref>), given that the actin filament is structurally polymorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galkin et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the observed elongation kinetics and pauses arise from direct modulation of the filament structure. In line with this hypothesis, two other proteins, the actin-binding domain of αE-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>) and an N-WASP construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khanduja and Kuhn, 2014</xref>), have recently been shown to alter filament kinetics and one of them, the actin-binding domain of αE-catenin, also influences filament structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>). Although atomically accurate simulations and more high resolution experiments are required to understand the molecular basis of monomer association and dissociation from the filament ends, our results provide evidence that lattice structural changes affect actin filament growth kinetics. The influence of different side-binding proteins on the growth kinetics was found to persist over different length scales. Although we do not currently know the mechanism of this difference, it is interesting to note that actin-binding proteins with globular binding domains (α-actinin, filamin, and NEM-myosin) have short-range affects whereas VASP and VASP ΔGAB, which have an unstructured binding motif, have more long-range affects.</p><p>Our experimental approach of using tethers immobilized on a solid surface imposes geometric and/or mechanical constrains on filament growth. As actin filaments form part of the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biro et al., 2013</xref>) and focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>) where they assemble into oligomeric membrane-anchored complexes with many actin-binding proteins tethered to the plasma membrane surface, our studies may not be too far from the biologically relevant situation in living cells. Moreover, the cell interior is very crowded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luby-Phelps, 2000</xref>) and some sub-cellular actin arrays are tightly packed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jasnin et al., 2013</xref>). Both of these conditions may lead to the immobilization of actin-binding proteins and generate similar constrains during filament growth. In addition, the presence of side-binding proteins in solution is sufficient for altering the filament kinetics and mechanics. Depending on the local cross-linker protein abundance in the cell, turnover kinetics on the order of 1 μm of filament within ∼1 min can be achieved, a rate at which treadmilling could become a contributing factor to cellular retrograde flow in the lamellipodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watanabe and Mitchison, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ponti et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, filament structural changes generated by side-binding proteins may also play a more active role in the identity and turnover of actin-based sub-cellular structures than previously thought, by regulating processes such as branching and fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>) or network mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>). Given the vast number of side-binding proteins, kinetic modulation via structural alteration may be a general regulatory mechanism of actin dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Proteins</title><p>Actin was obtained from chicken muscle using the method of acetone powder.

Myosin was purified and chemically inactivated with N-Ethyl-Maleimide according to the published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breitsprecher et al., 2009</xref>). Atto488-actin, α-actinin, and filamin were purchased from Hypermol (Bielefeld, Germany).

Actin labeling was performed under polymerization conditions (50 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) followed by depolymerization and gel filtration in G-buffer. The functionality of 1:1 dye:protein lysine-modified actin was found to be unaffected by the labeling as has been previously characterized using pyrene polymerization assays, TIRF elongation, EM and FCS experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crevenna et al., 2013</xref>). Unlabeled and labeled actin were mixed to yield a final ratio of 2:1 unlabeled:labeled actin molecules. The actin mixture (20 μl) was snap frozen and stored at −80°C until further use.

MBP-VASP was used without cleavage, since removal of the tag resulted in protein aggregation and degradation. For VASP ΔGAB purification, the VASP coding sequence without residues 198–220 was amplified using the pCoofy28-full-length VASP as a template, forward primer 5′-GCGCTTTTATCAACACCGCCACCTGCGGCTGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCAGGTGGCGGTGTTGATAAAAGCGCTGGTGTACCAACAAAAAC-3′.

Flow cells were washed three times with 90 μl of G-buffer. The tethering protein was then applied for 5 min and the flow cell was then washed again three times with 90 μl of G-buffer.

All protein in solution was assumed to adsorb on the upper and lower glass surfaces. To achieve consecutive lower tether densities, the total protein concentration was serially diluted. At low tethering protein concentrations, individual filaments swiveled around distinctive attachment points indicating that they are bound to single tethering molecules as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Howard et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crevenna et al., 2008</xref>). To estimate the density in an alternative manner, we measured the average number of pivot points per micron of filament at the two lowest protein concentrations and divided that by the average area covered during swiveling. Assuming a linear scaling with protein concentration, this estimation resulted in a slightly lower density (by a factor of 2) compared to those reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The concentration-based estimated densities represent an upper limit and are easy to reproduce.

For each condition, a 10<sup>5</sup> monomer long actin filament was polymerized, and the instantaneous elongation rate was calculated for every point and then averaged over the total length of the filament. The average elongation rate was calculated from the length of the polymer over time for each condition. The effect of the tethering protein was simulated by a change in the effective <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> at the site and vicinity of the tethering protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

This gives on the order of 10<sup>4</sup> side binding proteins for the highest densities computed. First, the tethering protein's positions were randomly chosen according to the protein density. The surface density was calculated assuming that all added tethering proteins adsorbed to the surface and were functionally active. To convert from surface density to fractional occupancy, we used the area occupied by 1 μm of actin filament (0.006 μm<sup>2</sup>), using a value of 370 subunits per micron of filament.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you can see from the reviews, there is enthusiasm for the role of side binding in modulating actin filament dynamics. There is no question in our minds that this could be a significant contribution to the field. However, we feel that there is a lot of work required to make many of the experiments solid.</p><p>We think that one of the key problems is summarized by Reviewer 1. Your main results come from VASP, while the other proteins have a more modest effect.</p><p>The problem with VASP as a 'side-binder' is that it contains a g-actin binding domain and can function as a polymerase. We think at minimum you would need to perform experiments using VASP with a debilitated or missing g-actin binding domain to unambiguously ascribe the effects they observed to the side-binding activity of VASP.</p><p>A second problem highlighted by another reviewer is that the experiments here were all done with the side-binding proteins acting to tether the actin to the slide surface. It seems important to also conduct experiments where the side-binders are not tethered. It is possible that some of the effects seen here result from torque induced by sequentially attached immobilized proteins, at least at high tethering density, and also the kinetic of side-binder binding and detachment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors report the effects of 'side-binding' proteins on actin polymerization kinetics. They use TIRF microscopy to measure the rates of growing and shrinking at the level of individual actin filaments, observe that the side-binders give different density-dependent effects, and attempt to connect their findings to the structure of the filament using computational simulations. This is a potentially interesting study that combines a variety of approaches to study a challenging and timely problem: how allostery can modulate the polymerization dynamics of biologically important polymers. From my perspective the most interesting claim is that different side-binding proteins can differentially tune the polymerization kinetics by perturbing/modulating the structure of the filament over length scales that exceed nearest neighbor relationships. Even while recognizing the challenging and interesting nature of the subject under study, however, I am not convinced that the authors' data provide unambiguous support for their headline claims.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) VASP gives by far the largest effects (e.g. 10-fold increase in apparent <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>, etc.), and is presented and interpreted as a 'side-binding' protein. Without the big effect evident from VASP, I think the results are less striking because much more modest in nature. The problem with VASP as a 'side-binder' is that it contains a g-actin binding domain and can function as a polymerase. I think at minimum the authors would need to perform experiments using VASP with a debilitated or missing g-actin binding domain to unambiguously ascribe the effects they observed to the side-binding activity of VASP. Otherwise they need to do some significant re-phrasing and acknowledge that maybe the VASP polymerase activity is contributing to the fast elongation, and this will mitigate and confuse the impact of their findings about the possible role(s) of side-binders. I think such an experiment should be readily achievable.</p><p>2) Excepting VASP, the observed effects on instantaneous growth rates are relatively modest and require substantial amounts of the side-binder. Effects on pausing are more substantial but it seems possible those are artifacts (see next point). In any event, pausing does not seem to be the core point of the paper. If I understand <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> properly, beside VASP there is little effect on 'pause-free E' until a density of about 1000 side-binders per μM^2. If I calculated right that is 1 side-binder roughly every 8 nm. But at 370 actins/μM of polymer, 8 nm average spacing between side-binders equates to something like one every 3 actins. Requiring such high densities undermines the claim of longer-range effects.</p><p>3) The authors presented some controls for non-specific surface effects, but I'm not sure they can rule out specific surface effects. Is the rate of filament growing or shrinking affected by how close the filament end is to the coverslip? Is it possible to do a subset of these experiments with side-binder in the solution but not on the coverslip (and using low densities of NEM-myosin on the coverslip)? If so, and if similar changes were observed it would help argue against the possibility that the results were an artifact of having a coverslip coated with filament binders. I don't view such an experiment as essential, but it would help. Likewise, unless I am overlooking something the bending seemed like it could be largely explained by a model in which the high density of side-binder simply 'grabbed' a fluctuating filament end.</p><p>4) There seems to be too wide a gap between the TIRF measurements and the Brownian dynamics simulations. The simulations show that different filament structures can give rise to different on rate constants, but by itself this claim is not surprising to me and I don't think it can be taken as evidence that the side-binders actually exerted their effects by altering the structure of the filament. Maybe they did, of course, but alternative explanations have not been convincingly ruled out. How to fix this is not obvious, but for me the connection between the TIRF results and the Brownian dynamics was too tenuous, and for me this weak connection undermined the thrust of their interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>The relationship between actin filament structure and actin filament dynamics, and how these can be modulated by filament binding proteins, is a long-standing and important question in the cytoskeletal field. Although some studies suggest that side-binding proteins can, through long range conformational effects, affect the kinetics and thermodynamics of monomer addition and dissociation at the filament ends, this has not yet been carefully examined. Moreover, there is some controversy in the recent literature on single actin filament dynamics arising from technical problems in the measurements. The work here addresses these issues through quantitative TIRF imaging of filament dynamics, and some computational analyses. The authors have used a new, more accurate procedure to determine the instantaneous position of the filament ends during imaging, which has revealed new aspects of filament dynamics not observed (or observable) in previous studies. This has led to several interesting conclusions, including that different side-binding proteins have different effects on actin binding and dissociation rates at the filament ends, and that the pointed end significantly populates a kinetically-trapped state.</p><p>In my opinion these advances would merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, I have concerns about some of the data that the authors will need to address before the work is technically solid. I am also less positive about the computational work at the end of the manuscript, and feel that is detracts from the experimental observations and should be down-played or removed.</p><p>First, the experiments here were all done with the side-binding proteins acting to tether the actin to the slide surface. It seems important to also conduct experiments where the side-binders are not tethered. It is possible that some of the effects seen here result from torque induced by sequentially attached immobilized proteins, at least at high tethering density, and also the kinetic of side-binder binding and detachment. Perhaps one molecule could be used at low density to immobilize the filaments, and a second could be added in solution?</p><p>Second, it is unclear to me how the kinetic parameters at the pointed end measured here for single filaments agree so well with previous bulk measurements, given the high pause probability illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. That is, according to line 201, the <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> are derived from the pause-free elongation rates. But the previously reported bulk measurements should represent a convolution of those parameters with the pausing probability, which is very high for the pointed end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). So the bulk rate constants should be much lower than those measured from the pause-free portions of the single-filament data.</p><p>Third, given recent controversies regarding the effects of unintended photo-crosslinking on actin filament dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niedermayer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kueh et al., 2008</xref>), the authors need to make certain that the interesting behaviors they observe are independent of such processes. The data in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> supplements are compelling in this regard. Nevertheless, both of their fluorophores, atto565 and atto488, are attached to actin in the same manner, through non-specific coupling to lysine residues. It is possible that the modified sites are particularly prone to photo-crosslinking. It would add even greater strength to their arguments (and be easy to do) to also try maleimide labeling, which uniquely modifies cysteine 376 in actin. Related to this point, the authors need to characterize and describe the labeling of their actin with atto488/565: how many sites on average were modified, what was the variability from preparation to preparation, what collection of sites were modified? How do they know that the labeling did not affect the properties of the actin?</p><p>Fourth, the modeling to fit the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> should be described in more detail in the main text. This information should not all be shifted to the methods section. Why does the effect of VASP propagate over a much longer range than the other ligands? Shouldn't <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub> be largely dependent on actin itself? It's hard to see how there could be 2 orders of magnitude difference between α-actinin and VASP. Can the authors explain this based on other observations? Perhaps related, while I am not an expert at modeling, the huge 68% confidence interval and large difference between VASP and the other proteins raises concerns about this analysis.</p><p>Finally, in my opinion the computations at the end of the paper do not strengthen the conclusions of the work, and provide a false sense of validation of the experimental data. I am highly suspect of the ability of MD simulations to accurately predict binding rates from the different structural models. The system is too complex, and the structural models themselves are at too low resolution. Further, it is almost certain that an actual filament samples many different structures contained within the manifold sampled by the available models. The finding that different structures produce different predicted rates in the calculations is not surprising; different starting points should give different simulations. But I don't see how these computed rates can be meaningfully interpreted or related back to the experimental data (e.g. is the Namba mode 3 structure a better model for the filament because it gives kinetic parameters that better match the experimental data? We can't know, since we don't know how well the simulations predict the kinetics in the first place). So I don't feel that the simulations either support or refute a relationship between structure and kinetics.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>Crevenna et al. used TIRF microscopy to conduct a detailed study on how the dynamics at the barbed end and the pointed end of the actin filaments change in response to binding of four proteins to the side of actin filaments.

To address the two main issues summarized by the editor above, we have performed measurements with VASP-ΔGAB and with a low density of tethering proteins and additional side-binding proteins in solution. The results have been included in the revised manuscript. Below is the detailed point-by-point response to the comments raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p><italic>In this paper, the authors report the effects of 'side-binding' proteins on actin polymerization kinetics. They use TIRF microscopy to measure the rates of growing and shrinking at the level of individual actin filaments, observe that the side-binders give different density-dependent effects, and attempt to connect their findings to the structure of the filament using computational simulations. This is a potentially interesting study that combines a variety of approaches to study a challenging and timely problem: how allostery can modulate the polymerization dynamics of biologically important polymers. From my perspective the most interesting claim is that different side-binding proteins can differentially tune the polymerization kinetics by perturbing/modulating the structure of the filament over length scales that exceed nearest neighbor relationships. Even while recognizing the challenging and interesting nature of the subject under study, however, I am not convinced that the authors' data provide unambiguous support for their headline claims</italic>.</p><p><italic>Major concerns</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) VASP gives by far the largest effects (e.g. 10-fold increase in apparent</italic> k<sub><italic>on</italic></sub><italic>, etc.), and is presented and interpreted as a 'side-binding' protein. Without the big effect evident from VASP, I think the results are less striking because much more modest in nature. The problem with VASP as a 'side-binder' is that it contains a g-actin binding domain and can function as a polymerase. I think at minimum the authors would need to perform experiments using VASP with a debilitated or missing g-actin binding domain to unambiguously ascribe the effects they observed to the side-binding activity of VASP. Otherwise they need to do some significant re-phrasing and acknowledge that maybe the VASP polymerase activity is contributing to the fast elongation, and this will mitigate and confuse the impact of their findings about the possible role(s) of side-binders. I think such an experiment should be readily achievable.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion and have now included experiments using a VASP construct with a deletion of the GAB domain. Filaments growing with this VASP ΔGAB construct as a tether showed very similar behavior to those using the full length VASP construct. The new data has now been incorporated throughout the manuscript and strengthens the hypothesis that it is the side-binding capacity of VASP that alters kinetics of filaments.</p><p><italic>2) Excepting VASP, the observed effects on instantaneous growth rates are relatively modest and require substantial amounts of the side-binder. Effects on pausing are more substantial but it seems possible those are artifacts (see next point). In any event, pausing does not seem to be the core point of the paper. If I understand</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E</italic></xref> <italic>properly, beside VASP there is little effect on 'pause-free E' until a density of about 1000 side-binders per μM^2. If I calculated right that is 1 side-binder roughly every 8 nm. But at 370 actins/μM of polymer, 8 nm average spacing between side-binders equates to something like one every 3 actins. Requiring such high densities undermines the claim of longer-range effects</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for this confusion. To convert from surface density to filament density, we have multiplied the surface density with the area occupied by 1 micron of filament (1μm x 6nm). Using this calculation, (1000 molecules μm<sup>-2</sup> * 0.006 μm<sup>2</sup> filament area) we obtain that VASP starts to exert an effect in kinetics at binding densities of ∼ 6 molecules per micron of filament and at filament densities of 10-20 binders per μm for the other proteins, supporting our observation of long-ranged interactions. To aid in the result presentation and help the reader in understanding the effects of side-binders on the filament growth, we have added a second x-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and we now mention the linear density throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) The authors presented some controls for non-specific surface effects, but I'm not sure they can rule out specific surface effects. Is the rate of filament growing or shrinking affected by how close the filament end is to the coverslip? Is it possible to do a subset of these experiments with side-binder in the solution but not on the coverslip (and using low densities of NEM-myosin on the coverslip)? If so, and if similar changes were observed it would help argue against the possibility that the results were an artifact of having a coverslip coated with filament binders. I don't view such an experiment as essential, but it would help. Likewise, unless I am overlooking something the bending seemed like it could be largely explained by a model in which the high density of side-binder simply 'grabbed' a fluctuating filament end</italic>.</p><p>Again, we thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion and agree that experiments with a low density of NEM-myosin on the surface while another side-binding protein is present in solution would help in clarify the origin of pauses. Therefore, we performed experiments with VASP, VASP ΔGAB or filamin in solution while filaments are tether using a low density of NEM-myosin. The growth behavior of such filaments was similar to what we observed when the side-binding protein was used as the tethering protein. These results are now discussed throughout the main text and included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig5">Figures 1-3 and 5</xref>.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we have also plotted the persistent length for filaments at low tethering densities while having the side-binding proteins in solution. In these experiments, a significant change in persistent length is observable although slightly smaller than for experiments performed at high tethering protein densities. Hence, we can conclude that bending is due to binding of the side-binding proteins and not a surface-induced affect.</p><p><italic>4) There seems to be too wide a gap between the TIRF measurements and the Brownian dynamics simulations. The simulations show that different filament structures can give rise to different on rate constants, but by itself this claim is not surprising to me and I don't think it can be taken as evidence that the side-binders actually exerted their effects by altering the structure of the filament. Maybe they did, of course, but alternative explanations have not been convincingly ruled out. How to fix this is not obvious, but for me the connection between the TIRF results and the Brownian dynamics was too tenuous, and for me this weak connection undermined the thrust of their interpretation</italic>.</p><p>We carried out Brownian dynamics simulations to explore the idea that subtle structural changes could give rise to changes in kinetics, which we observed in our estimates of the kinetic rates based on the different filament models. However, we acknowledge that there is little information regarding how the side-binding proteins modulate the filament structure and, more importantly, the connection is weak on how this structural alteration might translate into a kinetic effect. Therefore, we have now removed the entire section regarding the Brownian dynamics simulations from the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p><italic>The relationship between actin filament structure and actin filament dynamics, and how these can be modulated by filament binding proteins, is a long-standing and important question in the cytoskeletal field. Although some studies suggest that side-binding proteins can, through long range conformational effects, affect the kinetics and thermodynamics of monomer addition and dissociation at the filament ends, this has not yet been carefully examined. Moreover, there is some controversy in the recent literature on single actin filament dynamics arising from technical problems in the measurements. The work here addresses these issues through quantitative TIRF imaging of filament dynamics, and some computational analyses. The authors have used a new, more accurate procedure to determine the instantaneous position of the filament ends during imaging, which has revealed new aspects of filament dynamics not observed (or observable) in previous studies. This has led to several interesting conclusions, including that different side-binding proteins have different effects on actin binding and dissociation rates at the filament ends, and that the pointed end significantly populates a kinetically-trapped state</italic>.</p><p><italic>In my opinion these advances would merit publication in</italic> eLife<italic>.

Therefore, we have performed experiments with VASP, VASP ΔGAB or filamin in solution while filaments are tether using a low density of NEM-myosin.

Our pause-free elongation rates convoluted with observed pause rate (∼90%) would result in elongation rates (<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> of ∼ 0.2 and <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> ∼0.1) consistent with previously estimated rates using TIRF microscopy (Kuhn and Pollard, Biophys J, 2001, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The pause-free elongation rates agree with data obtained from EM data (Pollard, JCB, 1986) (misnamed “bulk” in the manuscript). EM data was obtained by measuring the length of individual filaments at various times points from 20 to 60 s using negative-stain electron microscopy (Pollard, JCB, 1986). We have noticed that pointed-end growth also occurs at the beginning of filament growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) before going to a paused state. One possible explanation for this difference is that the “initial pointed-end growth” could originate from an unconstrained ATP-actin monomer-based elongation. The appearance of the paused state could originate from ATP hydrolysis, actin flattening and/or a non-elongating structure (Narita et al., EMBO J, 2010) at the pointed-end. The origin of the paused state and it possible relationship to nucleotide or structure is unclear at the moment and we are working towards elucidating the mechanism behind it. We have included this discussion in the main text (subsection headed “Intrinsic filament dynamics”).</p><p><italic>Third, given recent controversies regarding the effects of unintended photo-crosslinking on actin filament dynamics (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46"><italic>Niedermayer et al., 2012</italic></xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35"><italic>Kueh et al., 2008</italic></xref><italic>), the authors need to make certain that the interesting behaviors they observe are independent of such processes.

How do they know that the labeling did not affect the properties of the actin?</italic></p><p>To ensure actin functionality is indeed a key issue with respect to protein labeling. We agree with the reviewer that, whenever possible, it is preferable to use a specific labeling strategy than stochastic labeling. Unfortunately, the use of the cysteine residue at position 376 for fluorophore attachment is problematic as the polymerizability is compromised (Kuhn and Pollard, Biophys J, 2001) and elongation rates are decreased with increasing amounts of labeled protein. In order to test for possible artifacts with stochastic labeling, we have previously characterized the functional properties of lysine atto-labeled actins where we used 1:1 dye:protein ratios for labeling (Crevenna et al., JBC, 2013), which leads to an average labeling of one fluorophore per protein. In Crevena et al., JBC, 2013, we carried out pyrene polymerization assays, TIRF elongation, EM and FCS experiments. Our results suggested that the lysine-labeled protein is fully functional. We have not observed (by mass spectrometry) a preference for lysine modification of the solvent exposed residues (data not shown). For TIRF assays, we mixed fully-functional labeled actin (Crevenna et al., JBC, 2013) with unlabeled actin to a final ratio of 2:1 unlabeled:labeled protein. We have now added the requested detailed information regarding the labeling procedure, etc., in the Material and methods.</p><p><italic>Fourth, the modeling to fit the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E</italic></xref> <italic>should be described in more detail in the main text. This information should not all be shifted to the methods section. Why does the effect of VASP propagate over a much longer range than the other ligands? Shouldn't</italic> L<sub>C</sub> <italic>be largely dependent on actin itself? It's hard to see how there could be 2 orders of magnitude difference between α-actinin and VASP.

The propagation length of the VASP ΔGAB construct is roughly 2 helical repeats, VASP is 4 helical repeats and the effects of α-actinin, filamin and NEM-myosin are on the order of 13 monomers, i.e. half a helical repeat. This could possibly implicate that the structure of the actin is important in determining the propagation length. However, as this is very speculative, we have decided not to discuss this in the current manuscript.</p><p>To have an estimate of the propagation length, we proposed the simplest model necessary. Hence, we have two free parameters (an amplitude and the <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>) and wished to avoid making more assumptions (e.g. fixing the amplitude). The results of our model yield the above range in <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub> values. However, the important point here is that altered kinetics parameters can be propagated along the actin filament in a side-binding protein dependent manner.</p><p><italic>Finally, in my opinion the computations at the end of the paper do not strengthen the conclusions of the work, and provide a false sense of validation of the experimental data.

However, they have been considered as potential artifacts and not as an intrinsic property of filaments. We have rephrased the main text to clarify this point. The text now reads: “Although growth pauses have been previously observed during filament elongation measured using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Kuhn et al., 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujiwara et al., 2007</xref>), these pauses were attributed to artifacts and were not characterized further.)</p><p><italic>2) The authors document that at higher side-binding protein density, actin filaments tend to grow either in a clockwise or in a counter-clockwise fashion.
