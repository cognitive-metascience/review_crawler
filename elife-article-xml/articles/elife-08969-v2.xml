assignment. The neurotransmitter dopamine is an important modulator of LA activity and facilitates fear memory formation, but whether dopamine neurons aid in the establishment of discriminative fear coding by the LA is unknown. NMDA-type glutamate receptors in dopamine neurons are critical for the prevention of generalized fear following an aversive experience, suggesting a potential link between a cell autonomous function of NMDAR in dopamine neurons and fear coding by the LA. Here, we utilized mice with a selective genetic inactivation functional NMDARs in dopamine neurons (DAT-NR1 KO mice) combined with behavior, in vivo electrophysiology, and <italic>ex vivo</italic> electrophysiology in LA neurons to demonstrate that plasticity underlying differential fear coding in the LA is regulated by NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons and alterations in this plasticity is associated non-discriminative cued-fear responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08969.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08969.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08969.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When we experience a situation that causes us to feel fearful, the brain processes information about the events that led up to it. This information is encoded by groups of nerve cells called neurons in a region of the brain called the lateral amygdala. The nerve cells communicate with each other through chemicals called neurotransmitters. At a junction between two neurons—called a synapse—neurotransmitters are released from one cell and influence the activity of the other cell.</p><p>Long-term changes in the strength of these communications in response to specific cues underlie the formation of memories about fearful events. When these changes occur incorrectly they can lead to memories about particular events becoming inaccurate, which can lead to fear being associated with related, but non-threatening, situations. This ‘generalization’ of fear can lead to generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in forming memories of fearful events. However, it is not clear whether neurons that release dopamine are also involved in correctly discriminating fearful events from non-fearful ones.</p><p>‘Receptor’ proteins called NMDARs on the surface of neurons that release dopamine are critical for preventing generalized fear. These receptors detect another neurotransmitter called glutamate. Jones et al. used genetics and ‘electrophysiology’ techniques to study these receptors in mice. The experiments show that a gene that encodes part of an NMDAR in dopamine neurons plays a key role in how fear memories are formed. When this gene is selectively switched off in the dopamine neurons, mice are more likely to develop generalized fear and anxiety behaviors after a threatening experience.</p><p>The experiments also demonstrate that these generalized threat responses are associated with differences in the way the synaptic connections in the lateral amygdala are strengthened. The next major challenge will be to find out which specific synaptic connections are strengthened and to establish how dopamine neuron activity patterns influences this connectivity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08969.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08969.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>genetic</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH094536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zweifel</surname><given-names>Larry S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21-MH098177</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zweifel</surname><given-names>Larry S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Discrimination of predictive and non-predictive fear stimuli requires plasticity in the lateral amygdala that is regulated by midbrain dopamine neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Across taxa the amygdala is a central locus for fear processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weiskrantz, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldstein, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Slotnick, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolphs et al., 1995</xref>). Comprised of several interconnected subdivisions that are populated by different types of neurons, the prevailing view is that substructures within the amygdala have specific roles for the acquisition, expression, and extinction of fear-related memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maren and Quirk, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehrlich et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Within the amygdala the LA is a major site of convergence for information that arrives from cortical and thalamic nuclei and represents an early processing point for emotionally salient information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LeDoux, 2000</xref>). Consistent with an early role of the LA in fear memory formation, inactivation of this area prior to, but not after, fear conditioning prevents cued fear behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LeDoux et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilensky et al., 1999</xref>). Optogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johansen et al., 2010</xref>) or suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johansen et al., 2014</xref>) of principal neurons in the LA facilitates and impairs cued fear memory formation, respectively. Direct stimulation of principal neuron cell bodies in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) can also increase anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tye et al., 2011</xref>), thus activation of the LA/BLA is a key neural substrate of fear and anxiety. In addition to principal projection neurons, distinct interneuron populations within the BLA can also potently regulate fear memory formation and fear coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission within this region regulates fear-related behavior and learning.</p><p>Fear generalization has been proposed to occur through a failure in an animal's ability to define specific outcome contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grillon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lovibond and Shanks, 2002</xref>). Thus, aberrant fear coding in the LA may be an early site of generalized fear manifestation. Consistent with this hypothesis, exposure to fear-inducing stimuli has been demonstrated to increase activity in the amygdala of human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breiter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morris et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rauch et al., 2000</xref>), and hyper-amygdala activation is observed in numerous disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rauch et al., 2000</xref>). In rodents, increasing the intensity of an unconditioned fear stimulus increases fear generalization that correlates with enhanced activation of LA neurons to both conditioned (CS+) and non-conditioned (CS−) stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh and Chattarji, 2015</xref>). In addition, suppression of GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated signaling in the LA facilitates non-associative long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses that correlates with generalized fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shaban et al., 2006</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that aberrant plasticity in the LA that facilitates non-selective potentiation of excitatory drive or suppression of inhibitory tone is an important neural substrate of generalized fear.</p><p>LA neurons demonstrate short latency responses to auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Ari and Le Gal la Salle, 1971</xref>). Following fear conditioning the latency of responses to predictive auditory stimuli decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quirk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maren, 2000</xref>) and the response amplitude increases selectively to predictive, but not non-predictive, stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins and Pare, 2000</xref>), thus demonstrating acquired selectivity in responding to CS+ and CS− stimuli. Acquisition of differential coding of predictive and non-predictive fear-related information is correlated with studies investigating changes in synaptic strength in the LA after fear conditioning. Auditory fear conditioning elicits LTP-like effects in LA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rogan and LeDoux, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogan et al., 1997</xref>) and elicits presynaptic enhancement of inputs arriving in the LA from the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKernan and Shinnick-Gallagher, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsvetkov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zinebi et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Dopamine is a potent modulator of plasticity in the LA. In the anesthetized rat, odor-evoked potentials in the LA are potentiated following pairing with a footshock that is dependent on dopamine receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosenkranz and Grace, 2002</xref>). In addition, dopamine signaling modulates local inhibitory networks in the LA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loretan et al., 2004</xref>), facilitates LTP induction through suppression of feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bissiere et al., 2003</xref>), and regulates intrinsic excitability of principal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with the modulation of fear-evoked plasticity in the LA, suppression of dopamine signaling attenuates acquisition of conditioned fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borowski and Kokkinidis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamont and Kokkinidis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guarraci et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greba et al., 2001</xref>) and fear memory expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nader and LeDoux, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Subsets of dopamine neurons are activated by aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schultz and Romo, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guarraci and Kapp, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brischoux et al., 2009</xref>) and undergo plasticity following an aversive experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lammel et al., 2011</xref>) or fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guarraci and Kapp, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brischoux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gore et al., 2014</xref>). NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons regulates both synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonci and Malenka, 1999</xref>) and phasic activation of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Overton and Clark, 1997</xref>), and disruption of NMDARs in dopamine neurons of mice results in the development of behavioral correlates of generalized fear and anxiety following an aversive experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zweifel et al., 2011</xref>). These results suggest a potential link between cell autonomous functions of this receptor in dopamine neurons and the disruption of fear coding in the amygdala that may be an underlying cause of fear generalization.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that mice lacking NMDARs in dopamine neurons have deficits in cued fear discrimination and that this deficit is associated with altered fear coding in the LA. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, fear generalization in DAT-NR1 KO mice was not associated with a non-specific increased activation of LA neurons to a non-US predictive conditioned stimulus (CS−), but rather a lack of enhanced LA activation to a US predictive conditioned stimulus (CS+). These findings demonstrate that erroneous enhancement of LA activity alone is not necessary for fear generalization, but rather cued fear discrimination coding in general is an essential component for proper fear assignment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generalized fear in DAT-NR1 KO mice alters signaling in the LA</title><p>We have shown previously that DAT-NR1 KO mice develop non-selective enhancement of acoustic startle reflex and increased anxiety-like behavior following an aversive experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zweifel et al., 2011</xref>).

Mice were presented with 10 trials each of a 10 s light (constant illumination) cue (CS+) that co-terminated with delivery of an unconditioned (US) fear stimulus (0.3 mA, 0.5 s footshock), randomly interspersed with delivery of a distinct light (pulsing illumination) cue (CS−) that did not co-terminate with delivery of the US. 24 hours following conditioning mice were given interspersed presentations of the CS+ and CS− in a novel context. Both DAT-NR1 KO mice and littermate controls displayed enhanced fear (freezing behavior) following both one and two days of conditioning.

Previous studies have demonstrated that failure of LA neurons to discriminate between fear predictive and non-predictive stimuli is highly correlated with fear generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh and Chattarji, 2015</xref>). More specifically these authors demonstrate that increased intensity of the US results in non-selective enhancement of LA excitatory responses to a CS−, thus impairing the discrimination between CS+ and CS− (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh and Chattarji, 2015</xref>). Consistent with these findings it has also been shown that disruption of GABA<sub>B</sub> signaling in the LA results in non-associative plasticity, and mice lacking the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subtype GABA<sub>B(1a)</sub> develop generalized fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shaban et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast to previous reports of generalized fear being associated with an over-exuberance of plasticity and activation of the LA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shaban et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh and Chattarji, 2015</xref>), in DAT-NR1 KO mice with generalized fear the LA neurons appear as though no CS/US association has been made. More specifically, LA neurons in DAT-NR1 KO mice do not potentiate to the CS+, fail to reduce inhibition to the CS−, and demonstrate longer response latencies to the CS+ and CS−, similar to longer response latencies to the CS− in control mice. Although the manner in which discrimination occurs between activated and inhibited neurons differs, the end result is an acquired differential response that is dependent upon NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons. These results indicate that generalized freezing behavior to the CS− is not dependent upon excessive activation of the LA, but rather suggest that discriminative coding in the LA reflects the proper assignment of cue-outcome contingencies. Collectively, these findings suggest that disruption of plasticity underlying discriminative fear coding in the LA is associated with generalized fear responses. Our results extend previous findings and confirm that plasticity in the LA is associated with discriminative fear; however, it is not an over-exuberance of plasticity per se that underlies generalization but rather the lack of appropriate plasticity.</p><p>If a lack of synaptic strengthening occurs in the LA in the absence of NMDA receptor signaling in dopamine neurons, then where is the site of heightened threat responses following fear conditioning? It is well established that the LA is an early site of convergent sensory information processing that is essential for fear memory acquisition and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LeDoux, 2000</xref>); however, fear coding and plasticity are broadly distributed across multiple brain regions including the thalamus, cortex (sensory and prefrontal), and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, plasticity also occurs within other subdivision of the amygdala including the BLA and lateral subdivision of the central nucleus (CeAl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). More specifically, generalized defensive responses to threat have been correlated with non-specific coding of cue information in the CeAl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>), and activation of a specific population of CeAl neurons during discriminative fear conditioning results in response generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botta et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the generalized threat responses reported here are mediated by exaggerated responses in the CeA or other areas of the brain implicated in fear processing, many of which are innervated by midbrain dopamine neurons.</p><p>Consistent with plasticity in the activity of LA neurons in freely moving mice during fear conditioning, we observed synaptic plasticity in LA neurons in acute slice following fear conditioning in control mice that was absent in DAT-NR1 KO mice. Numerous studies have identified pathway-specific plasticity in the LA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rogan and LeDoux, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKernan and Shinnick-Gallagher, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zinebi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schroeder and Shinnick-Gallagher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2012</xref>). Examination of the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in response to stimulation of either thalamic or cortical input to LA neurons did not reveal a pathway-specific change in either excitatory or inhibitory drive. These findings indicate that either one or both pathways are enhanced with proportional increases in excitatory and inhibitory drive, or that neither pathway is altered specifically. Our observations of increased frequency of both mIPSCs and mEPSCs suggest a scenario in which one or both pathways are potentiated with proportional changes in excitatory and inhibitory inputs.</p><p>There are numerous mechanisms that have been identified that underlie plasticity in LA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodrigues et al., 2004</xref>) with both pre- and postsynaptic sites of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsvetkov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zinebi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apergis-Schoute et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schroeder and Shinnick-Gallagher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fourcaudot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2012</xref>). Our observed increase in the frequency of both mEPSCs and mIPSCs without a concomitant change in amplitude, is consistent with a presynaptic increase in synaptic transmission, similar to previous descriptions of facilitated synaptic transmission from cortical and thalamic inputs to LA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKernan and Shinnick-Gallagher, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsvetkov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zinebi et al., 2002</xref>). Although we did not observe an increase in mEPSC amplitude this does not exclude postsynaptic changes in glutamate receptors. It was previously demonstrated that trafficking of postsynaptic AMPA receptors in the LA is critical for associative memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rumpel et al., 2005</xref>). One potential explanation for these apparent discrepancies is the unmasking of previously silent synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008</xref>). Indeed, silent synapses have been reported in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) and stress has been shown to increase the formation of nascent silent synapses in the LA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suvrathan et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, it has been proposed that different synaptic sites of LTP in LA neurons (pre- vs postsynaptic) may occur depending on the strength the US, with low US intensities favoring presynaptic LTP and high US intensities favoring postsynaptic LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). Because we used a low intensity footshock (0.3 mA) it is possible that our protocol favored the induction of a presynaptic form of synaptic strengthening.</p><p>The mechanism by which NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons influences plasticity in fear coding in the LA remains to be elucidated. We have previously demonstrated that NMDARs in dopamine neurons regulate phasic activation of these neurons in response to an aversive stimulus, thus suggesting that phasic dopamine release may facilitate plasticity at excitatory and inhibitory synapses within the LA. Consistent with this hypothesis, previous studies have demonstrated that dopamine signaling within the LA modulates local inhibitory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loretan et al., 2004</xref>) and gates LTP induction in LA neurons through a suppression of feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bissiere et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to local inhibitory neurons, dopamine neurons innervate paracapsular intercalated cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marcellino et al., 2012</xref>) and potently modulate intercalated neurons through a D1 receptor dependent inhibitory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marowsky et al., 2005</xref>). More specifically, dopamine signaling in lateral paracapsular intercalated neurons suppresses feedforward inhibition from cortical inputs to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marowsky et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, phasic dopamine release facilitated by NMDARs in dopamine neurons is likely to regulate excitability and plasticity of LA neurons through both local inhibitory networks and feedforward inhibition from lateral paracapsular intercalated neurons.</p><p>In addition to suppression of inhibition, dopamine increases the excitability of LA neurons through induction of a slow afterhyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, these effects would significantly increase the spike firing of LA neurons. We find that the activity of a significant proportion of LA neurons increases after the first presentation of the US in control mice that parallels our finding of increased Fos levels in the LA following the first conditioning session. Footshock has been demonstrated to increase firing of midbrain dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brischoux et al., 2009</xref>), thus increased dopamine release facilitated by NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons could explain the observed increase in LA activity in control mice that is absent in DAT-NR1 KO mice. Such an increase in the activity of LA neurons would then facilitate the induction of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bissiere et al., 2003</xref>) and lasting changes in synaptic strength.</p><p>NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons regulates phasic activation of these neurons as well as synaptic plasticity. Thus, alterations in fear-evoked plasticity within dopamine neurons could also be a major contributor to the disruption of fear coding in the LA of DAT-NR1 KO mice. Using a similar fear conditioning paradigm we have previously shown that dopamine neurons undergo plasticity in fear-evoked increases in calcium signals in dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gore et al., 2014</xref>), which occurs on a similar time course to the results described here. Others have also demonstrated that mesocortical projecting dopamine neurons undergo synaptic plasticity following a painful experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lammel et al., 2011</xref>), indicating pathway specific activation of dopamine neurons. In support of an interdependent plasticity between dopamine neurons and target structures, it has been demonstrated that NMDAR-dependent cocaine-evoked plasticity in dopamine neurons occurs prior to plasticity in dopaminergic targets of the nucleus accumbens and that plasticity within the accumbens is dependent on NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mameli et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The interrelationship between plasticity and phasic activation of dopamine neurons and the relationship between phasic dopamine and plasticity in dopamine neurons that modulates plasticity in the LA remains to be determined. However, our results provide an important first step in linking NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons with fear discrimination coding in the LA and demonstrate that fear generalization can occur in the absence of hyperexcitation of the LA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All Materials and methods were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Mice were habituated to handling each day one week prior to conditioning. For baseline cue responding mice were placeplaced in the box with a white corrugated plastic insert placed in the chamber to cover the walls and shock grid. Mice were assessed for freezing in response to three randomly interspersed presentations of the CS+ and CS− following a two minute baseline period. Each session of the 2-day fear conditioning paradigm included a 2 min baseline period followed by 20 randomly interleaved trials, comprised of 10 CS + trials and 10 CS− trials, each followed by a 110 s inter-trial interval (ITI). The CS + trials consisted of a constant light cue presentation for 9.5 s, terminating with a 0.5 s 0.3 mA footshock (US) and the CS− trials used a different light cue that flashed 5 times for 200 ms every 2 s, ending with the last light flash and the absence of the US. For assessment of cue-specific freezing behavior 24 hr following conditioning mice were placed in the chamber with the white corrugated plastic insert and freezing was assessed in response to three randomly interspersed presentations of the CS+ and CS− following a 2 min baseline period.

Microdrive implantations in anesthetized mice were stereotaxically targeted at the LA (−1.65 mm A-P, ±2.85→3.25 mm M-L, −4.3 mm D-V; Paxinos); Bilateral targeting was achieved using coupled polyimide guide tubes (200 µm OD; source) spaced at 6.5 mm. One week after surgery, mice were connected to a 16-channel Medusa Preamplifier and filtered signals (300-5000 Hz) were acquired using a RZ5 Signal Processor (Tucker–Davis Technologies). Tetrodes were lowered daily in ∼40 μm increments until unit activity was observed, at which point the animals began the fear conditioning paradigm; tetrodes were not lowered on subsequent days unless cell activity was absent. For conditioning, mice were treated as above, except they were not exposed to the testing chamber (white corrugated plastic insert) and did not receive cue presentations prior to conditioning. Conditioning proceeded each day following a 10 min baseline period to establish basal neural activity. Tetrode placement was histologically confirmed postmortem using cresyl violet histochemical stain and the presence of implant-induced tissue damage. Neurons were isolated by cluster analysis using Offline Sorter (Plexon) and subsequently formatted and analyzed with MATLAB (Mathworks) and Prism (Graphpad Software). Data were acquired from 13 control and 12 DAT-NR1 KO mice.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the current manuscript, Jones and colleagues demonstrate that genetic inactivation of NR1 receptors in dopamine neurons results in aberrant fear discrimination and alterations of neural plasticity in the lateral amygdala, which they suggest may underlie fear generalization. While this is an important step towards elucidating the influence of dopaminergic signaling in discriminative learning, there are a few important points that should be clarified:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The c-fos experiment is performed after a single conditioning session. To what extent does this correspond to the behavioral procedure used for the subsequent experiments involving in vivo and in vitro recordings, in particular with regard to handling and pre-exposure?</p><p>2) The fear discrimination procedure implemented by the authors does not control for the possibility that constant illumination is more readily conditioned than pulsing illumination. Without this control, it remains possible that the impairment of the DAT-NR1 KO mice is simply due to altered sensory processing.</p><p>3) In the design of the in vitro recording experiments, the authors draw an equivalence between naïve mice and mice on Day 1 of in vivo recordings; similarly between mice 24 hr following the second conditioning session and mice on Day 3 of in vivo recordings. However, over the course of each conditioning day, mice receive 10 reinforced CS + trials and 10 non-reinforced CS- trials. Therefore, it seems particularly confounded to consider mice on Day 1 of in vivo recordings to be equivalent to naïve mice.</p><p>4) In the second paragraph of the Discussion, the authors conclude: “Our observations of increased frequency of both mIPSCs and mEPSCs, along with previous observations of increased excitatory input from both cortex and thalamus following fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKernan 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zinebi 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsvetkov 2002</xref>), suggest a scenario in which both pathways are potentiated with proportional changes in excitatory and inhibitory inputs.” The authors should therefore provide the data independently for excitatory and inhibitory PSPs in order to substantiate this conclusion.</p><p>5) In the third paragraph of the Discussion, the authors write: “In contrast to previous report of generalized fear being associated with an over exuberance of plasticity and activation of the LA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh 2015</xref>), in DAT-NR1 KO mice with generalized fear the LA neurons appear as though no CS-US association has been made. More specifically, LA neurons in DAT-NR1 KO mice do not potentiate to the Cs+, fail to reduce inhibition to the CS-, and demonstrate reduced response latencies to the CS+ and CS-, similar to reduced response latencies to the CS- in control mice.” However, this conclusion appears to be based upon the assumption that the Day 1 recordings represent the baseline CS+ and CS- responses, yet over the course of Day 1 the mice receive 10 reinforced CS + trials and 10 non-reinforced CS- trials. Therefore, it would be very helpful to see the baseline (pre-training) CS+ and CS- responses for the reported units in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>, in order to evaluate whether any plasticity of excitatory and/or inhibitory responses is already evident on Day 1 of conditioning.</p><p>6) Do the authors find a correlation between the magnitude of neural responsivity and/or proportion of CS-responsive neurons with the CS-responses of the mice?</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>, the authors should provide the proportion of neurons that respond to CS+, CS- and CS+/CS-? Does this differ between control and DAT-NR1 KO mice?</p><p>8) Is there a difference in response latencies between control and DAT-NR1 KO mice? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, there appears to be a shorter response latency for both CS+ and CS- in DAT-NR1 KO mice particularly on Day 3.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08969.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The c-fos experiment is performed after a single conditioning session.

The mice were treated the same way as animals that underwent fear conditioning for in vivo electrophysiology analysis except that in this assay mice were euthanized 90 min following conditioning. These animals would therefore be most representative of mice recorded during the first day of conditioning. All mice were handled for one week prior to conditioning. One major difference between mice that underwent conditioning for Fos and electrophysiology recordings (both in vitro and in vivo) vs mice that were analyzed for freezing is that mice for Fos and physiology did not receive any pre-exposure to the conditioning chamber. Mice used for Fos and physiology were also not exposed to the testing chamber and were only exposed to the conditioning chamber. Recording during conditioning allowed us to observe neural responses to both the CS and US presentations within the same session. We have included this additional information in our revised Methods section.</p><p><italic>2) The fear discrimination procedure implemented by the authors does not control for the possibility that constant illumination is more readily conditioned than pulsing illumination. Without this control, it remains possible that the impairment of the DAT-NR1 KO mice is simply due to altered sensory processing.</italic></p><p>We agree that it is possible that the two cues may be differentially conditioned based on whether they were constant or pulsing. It is also possible that this difference contributes to the discrimination deficits in DAT-NR1 KO mice. However, we have previously demonstrated that DAT-NR1 KO mice develop non-specific fear responses in novel contexts and generalized anxiety using a different conditioning paradigm indicating that generalization in these mice is broader than the context used here. In addition, we now report the electrophysiological responses of neurons activated and inhibited by CS+ and CS- stimuli in both control and DAT-NR1 KO mice during the first and last trial of conditioning on the first day. These results reveal that there are no major differences in the response profiles of these neurons on the first day indicating that at least at the level of the LA sensory information is initially processed equivalently. In addition, we also now provide in vivo electrophysiology data from control mice that received the same cues used in conditioning, but were not paired with footshock. This data reveals that response profiles of activated neurons does not change across multiple days of repeated stimulus presentation. Thus our results demonstrating enhanced responding of LA neurons to the CS+ during conditioning reflects associative fear processing and is not related to differential responding to repeated presentation of the different cue stimuli.</p><p><italic>3) In the design of the</italic> in vitro <italic>recording experiments, the authors draw an equivalence between naïve mice and mice on Day 1 of</italic> in vivo <italic>recordings; similarly between mice 24 hr following the second conditioning session and mice on Day 3 of</italic> in vivo <italic>recordings. However, over the course of each conditioning day, mice receive 10 reinforced CS + trials and 10 non-reinforced CS- trials. Therefore, it seems particularly confounded to consider mice on Day 1 of</italic> in vivo <italic>recordings to be equivalent to naïve mice.</italic></p><p>We apologize for the confusion on this matter. We have removed that statement from the manuscript and provided additional detail to the methods to clarify how each group of mice was treated. Although naïve mice were handled the same as conditioned mice they did not receive CS/US pairings. These mice were truly naïve and most closely represented conditioned mice at the start of day one of in vivo electrophysiology recording.</p><p><italic>4) In the second paragraph of the Discussion, the authors conclude: “Our observations of increased frequency of both mIPSCs and mEPSCs, along with previous observations of increased excitatory input from both cortex and thalamus following fear conditioning (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39"><italic>McKernan 1997</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67"><italic>Zinebi 2002</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61"><italic>Tsvetkov 2002</italic></xref><italic>), suggest a scenario in which both pathways are potentiated with proportional changes in excitatory and inhibitory inputs.” The authors should therefore provide the data independently for excitatory and inhibitory PSPs in order to substantiate this conclusion.</italic></p><p>We agree that we cannot support this conclusion based on the mEPSC and mIPSC frequency. We have removed this statement and provided a much more in-depth discussion of these findings. With regard to the quantification of the PSPs, we cannot provide an accurate individual average of the IPSP or EPSPs due to variability in stimulating electrode placement. Typically PSPs are normalized to baseline responses to allow for comparisons across slices and across animals. Because we are comparing two independent groups in which baseline responses cannot be established, an alternative method of normalization is required. To achieve this we compared the ratio of EPSPs to IPSPs, similar to what is done for the generation of AMPA/NMDA receptor ratios. Because we did not see selective effects on EPSPs or IPSPs in either pathway, we analyzed mEPSCs and mIPSCs which do allow for more accurate direct comparisons across groups. In the latter instance we observed and increase in the frequency of both mEPSCs and mIPSCs indicating that both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are changed in control mice, but not DAT-NR1 KO mice.</p><p><italic>5) In the third paragraph of the Discussion, the authors write: “In contrast to previous report of generalized fear being associated with an over exuberance of plasticity and activation of the LA (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"><italic>Ghosh 2015</italic></xref><italic>), in DAT-NR1 KO mice with generalized fear the LA neurons appear as though no CS-US association has been made. More specifically, LA neurons in DAT-NR1 KO mice do not potentiate to the Cs+, fail to reduce inhibition to the CS-, and demonstrate reduced response latencies to the CS+ and CS-, similar to reduced response latencies to the CS- in control mice.” However, this conclusion appears to be based upon the assumption that the Day 1 recordings represent the baseline CS+ and CS- responses, yet over the course of Day 1 the mice receive 10 reinforced CS + trials and 10 non-reinforced CS- trials. Therefore, it would be very helpful to see the baseline (pre-training) CS+ and CS- responses for the reported units in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5"><italic>Figures 4 and 5</italic></xref><italic>, in order to evaluate whether any plasticity of excitatory and/or inhibitory responses is already evident on Day 1 of conditioning.</italic></p><p>We agree that mice receiving CS/US presentations on day 1 are not equivalent to naïve mice and we have modified previous statements. We have also clarified the text to better convey that mice that underwent fear conditioning to assess freezing are not the same mice that were used for in vivo recordings, or slice recordings. Unfortunately, we did not record baseline cue responses prior to conditioning in mice that underwent in vivo recordings. However, we did investigate the initial responses to both the CS+ and CS- cue presentations in both groups (Day 1, trial 1) and compared those responses to the last trial of the day (Day 1, trial 10). We did not observe significant differences in the responses of either group to the CS+ and CS- cue presentation on the first vs last trial. This data is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) Do the authors find a correlation between the magnitude of neural responsivity and/or proportion of CS-responsive neurons with the CS-responses of the mice?</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, we did not perform behavioral analysis on mice undergoing in vivo recordings. We find that freezing behavior in mice implanted with microdrives and tethered to pre-amplifiers is unreliable. For this reason we assessed behavior in independent cohorts of mice and cannot directly correlate unit responses to freezing behavior.</p><p><italic>7) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</italic></xref><italic>, the authors should provide the proportion of neurons that respond to CS+, CS- and CS+/CS-?

We did not observe differences in this proportion across days or across groups, with the majority showing responses to both cues (∼80%).</p><p><italic>8) Is there a difference in response latencies between control and DAT-NR1 KO mice? In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 1C and D</italic></xref><italic>, there appears to be a shorter response latency for both CS+ and CS- in DAT-NR1 KO mice particularly on Day 3.</italic></p><p>We have included the analysis comparing the response latencies to the different stimuli on days 1 and 3 of conditioning.
