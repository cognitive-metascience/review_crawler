protein of known structure remains an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we report significant progress in this area. We first describe de novo blind  structure predictions of unprecendented accuracy we made for two proteins in large families in the recent CASP11 blind test of protein structure prediction methods by incorporating residue–residue co-evolution information in the Rosetta structure prediction program. We then describe the use of this method to generate structure models for 58 of the 121 large protein families in prokaryotes for which three-dimensional structures are not available. These models, which are posted online for public access, provide structural information for the over 400,000 proteins belonging to the 58 families and suggest hypotheses about mechanism for the subset for which the function is known, and hypotheses about function for the remainder.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09248.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09248.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09248.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are long chains made up of small building blocks called amino acids. These chains fold up in various ways to form the three-dimensional structures that proteins need to be able work properly. Therefore, to understand how a protein works it is important to determine its structure, but this is very challenging. It is possible to predict the structure of a protein with high accuracy if previous experiments have revealed the structure of a similar protein. However, for almost half of all known families of proteins, there are currently no members whose structures have been solved.</p><p>The three-dimensional shape of a protein is determined by interactions between various amino acids. During evolution, the structure and activity of proteins often remain the same across species, even if the amino acid sequences have changed. This is because pairs of amino acids that interact with each other tend to ‘co-evolve’; that is, if one amino acid changes, then the second amino acid also changes in order to accommodate it. By identifying these pairs of co-evolving amino acids, it is possible to work out which amino acids are close to each other in the three-dimensional structure of the protein. This information can be used to generate a structural model of a protein using computational methods.</p><p>Now, Ovchinnikov et al. developed a new method to predict the structures of proteins that combines data on the co-evolution of amino acids, as identified by GREMLIN with the structural prediction software called Rosetta. A community-wide experiment called CASP—which tests different methods of protein prediction—showed that, in two cases, this new method works much better than anything previously used to predict the structures of proteins. Ovchinnikov et al. then used this method to make models for proteins belonging to 58 different protein families with currently unknown structures.</p><p>These predictions were found to be highly accurate and the protein families each have thousands of members, so Ovchinnikov et al.'s findings are expected to be useful to researchers in a wide variety of research areas. A future challenge is to extend these methods to the many protein families that have hundreds rather than thousands of members.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09248.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09248.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>co-evolution</kwd><kwd>structure prediction</kwd><kwd>protein fold</kwd><kwd>protein family</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>H. salinarum</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. solfataricus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM092802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Hahnbeom</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM094575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grishin</surname><given-names>Nick V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation (Robert A.

For roughly 41% of protein families, there is currently no member with known structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>). While high-resolution ab initio structure prediction has remained a challenge, considerable success has been achieved in generating high-accuracy models when sparse experimental data are available to constrain the space of conformations to be sampled. This additional information, in combination with a reasonably accurate energy function, has enabled the determination of high-resolution structures for much larger proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DiMaio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lange et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has shown that residue–residue contacts can be accurately inferred from co-evolution patterns in sequences of related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morcos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hopf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nugent and Jones, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sułkowska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>). While early approaches estimated these restraints by inverting a covariance matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morcos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 2012</xref>), subsequent studies have shown that a pseudo-likelihood (PLM)-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balakrishnan et al., 2011</xref>) results in more accurate predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ekeberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>).

Starting from an extended polypeptide chain, Monte Carlo + Minimization searches through conformations with local structure consistent with the local sequence were carried out, optimizing first a low-resolution energy function favoring hydrophobic burial and backbone hydrogen bonding, and second a detailed all atom energy function describing hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, and solvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das and Baker, 2008</xref>). In the first phase, sampling was carried out in internal coordinates (the backbone torsion angles), and hence, to avoid loss of sampling efficiency by early formation of contacts between residues distant along the sequence, predicted contact information was first added for residues close along the chain and subsequently for residues with increasing sequence separation. The contact information was implemented through residue–residue distance restraints whose strength and shape were functions of the strength of the evolutionary covariance between the residues (see ‘Materials and methods’). Large numbers of independent trajectories were carried out using the <email>Rosetta@Home</email> distributed computing project, and the lowest energy (Rosetta all atom energy plus evolutionary restraint fit) models were recombined and further optimized using a new iterative version (see ‘Materials and methods’) of the RosettaCM hybridization protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Song et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). The five lowest energy structures were submitted as predictions to the CASP organizers.</p><p>When several months later the actual structures of these proteins were revealed, the predictions were found to be considerably more accurate than any previous predictions made in the 20 years of CASP experiments for proteins over 100 amino acids that lack homologs of known structure. Two particularly striking examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; the prediction for the complex 256 residue structure of T0806 is 3.6 Cα-RMSD from the crystal structure (2.9 Å over 223 residues), and the prediction for the 108 residue T0824 is 4.2 Cα-RMSD from the crystal structure (2.7 Å over 77 residues). The models accurately recapitulate the complex topologies of the proteins. Due to time restraints, the calculations could not be run to convergence during CASP; with additional sampling, the lowest energy model for T0806 has an RMSD of 2.1 Å over 245 residues to the experimentally determined structure. Both the co-evolution derived contacts and the new iterative hybridization protocol were critical to obtaining higher accuracy models: Rosetta calculations without constraints failed to converge (data not shown), and the ROBETTA server models generated without the hybridization step were considerably less accurate (11.6 vs 3.6 Cα-RMSD for T0806 and 14.0 vs 4.2 Cα-RMSD for T0824).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09248.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Accurate blind structure prediction of CASP11 targets T0806 and T0824.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Location of the most strongly co-evolving residue pairs.

To facilitate evaluation of such models, we developed a length-independent measure of the fit between a set of predicted contacts and a model: the ratio of the total GREMLIN score of the model to the score expected if it were the native structure (Rc, see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>We chose to focus on families with at least 4× (protein length) sequences to ensure that the predicted contacts have high accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>; at 4L sequences, the top 1.5L contacts are on average 50% correct)<italic>.</italic> Families with detectable structure homologs were excluded using a sensitive sequence search method (HHsearch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Söding, 2005</xref>]). For computational efficiency, an initial scan was done using a single sequence, excluding families where the top hit had an e-value of 1 or greater to any protein of known structure. We identified 100 families satisfying these criteria in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Gram-negative, Proteobacteria), and an additional 22, 5, and 4 families in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (Gram-positive, Firmicutes bacterium), <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> (Euryarchaeota), and <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (Crenarchaeota), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For each of these top families, we carried out a more sensitive profile–profile sequence search against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using HHsearch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Söding, 2005</xref>) and the fold recognition method SPARKS-X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). We eliminated families if the top HHsearch hit had an E-value less than 1E-04 and was consistent with GREMLIN contacts.</p><p>An alternative approach to structure modeling using predicted contacts is to search for weak fold recognition matches to known protein structures and determine if any of the hits fit the predicted contacts. This approach is not very effective for the families identified as described above; for only 4 of the 122 families with HHsearch E-values greater than 1E-04 did one of the top ten hits from HHsearch or SPARKS-X match the predicted contacts (have Rc values greater than 0.6).</p><p>Many of the families we identified with no homologs of known structure are transmembrane (TM) proteins. To evaluate the accuracy of our co-evolution-based structure prediction method on TM proteins, we tested it on a benchmark of 13 TM proteins with recently determined structures. Rather than evaluating the lowest energy five models as in the case of the CASP experiment, we instead selected the most central (see ‘Materials and methods’) low-energy model and eliminated positions not converged within the lowest energy models or not constrained by contact information (see ‘Materials and methods’). As shown in<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1</xref>, for the 11 of the 13 proteins for which the structure prediction calculations converged, the RMSD of the predicted structure to the experimentally determined structure over the converged and constrained residues was below 4.0 Å (the RMSDs over the structurally aligned regions were all below 2.8 Å). Features such as kinked, discontinuous, and re-entrant helices as well as coils within the bilayer that complicate approaches to membrane protein structure prediction that assume the accuracy of a TM helix prediction were all recovered correctly (for example, the re-entrant helices of aquaporin; the power of fragment-based approaches to model such features was noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nugent and Jones, 2012</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09248.006</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Transmembrane protein benchmark</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09248.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09248.006</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">PDB</th><th rowspan="2">Name</th><th rowspan="2">Seq/len</th><th colspan="2">Full protein</th><th colspan="2">Converged</th><th colspan="2">Aligned</th></tr><tr><th>rmsd</th><th>Length</th><th>rmsd</th><th>Length</th><th>rmsd</th><th>Length</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>4HE8_H (3.3)</td><td>NADH-quinone oxidoreductase subunit 8</td><td>17.3</td><td>4.9</td><td>269</td><td>2.1</td><td>183</td><td>2.2</td><td>234</td></tr><tr><td>1SOR_A (N/A)</td><td>Aquaporin-0</td><td>26.2</td><td>2.7</td><td>221</td><td>2.1</td><td>188</td><td>2.0</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>4Q2E_A (3.4)</td><td>Phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase</td><td>18.6</td><td>5.4</td><td>262</td><td>3.5</td><td>176</td><td>2.8</td><td>178</td></tr><tr><td>4HTT_A (6.8)</td><td>Sec-independent protein translocase protein</td><td>14.6</td><td>3.9</td><td>225</td><td>1.8</td><td>124</td><td>2.4</td><td>181</td></tr><tr><td>4P6V_E (3.5)</td><td>Na(+)-translocating NADH-quinone reductase subunit D</td><td>14.3</td><td>5.0</td><td>194</td><td>1.4</td><td>49</td><td>2.8</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td>4J72_A (3.3)</td><td>Phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase</td><td>19.9</td><td>6.6</td><td>323</td><td>3.1</td><td>251</td><td>2.4</td><td>237</td></tr><tr><td>3V5U_A (1.9)</td><td>Sodium/Calcium exchanger</td><td>10.2</td><td>3.9</td><td>297</td><td>3.7</td><td>284</td><td>2.3</td><td>245</td></tr><tr><td>4PGS_A (2.5)</td><td>Uncharacterized protein YetJ</td><td>15.4</td><td>3.5</td><td>207</td><td>2.7</td><td>175</td><td>2.2</td><td>183</td></tr><tr><td>4QTN_A (2.8)</td><td>Vitamin B3 transporter PnuC</td><td>9.0</td><td>4.2</td><td>202</td><td>3.0</td><td>155</td><td>2.8</td><td>178</td></tr><tr><td>4OD4_A (3.3)</td><td>4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase</td><td>22.8</td><td>3.9</td><td>275</td><td>3.4</td><td>242</td><td>2.8</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>4O6M_A (1.9)</td><td>CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase</td><td>13.3</td><td>4.1</td><td>188</td><td>4.0</td><td>165</td><td>2.3</td><td>159</td></tr><tr><td>4WD8_A (2.3)</td><td>Bestrophin domain protein</td><td>5.94</td><td>N/A</td><td>268</td><td colspan="4">Not converged</td></tr><tr><td>4F35_A (3.2)</td><td>Transporter, NadC family</td><td>14.5</td><td>N/A</td><td>434</td><td colspan="4">Not converged</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Column 1, PDB code (resolution of the crystal structure); column 2, protein name; column 3, sequences per length, after filtering to reduce the redundancy to 90%; column 4, RMSD of predicted structure to native structure; column 5, length of native structure modeled; column 6, RMSD over converged and constrained region; column 7, length of converged and constrained region; column 8, RMSD over TM-align structural alignment; column 9, length of structurally aligned region.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>We built models for representatives of the 121 families with unknown structures using the Rosetta co-evolution-guided structure prediction protocol, eliminating from the lowest energy structures the non-converged and non-constrained residues.

The biological implications of all of these structures cannot be explored in a single paper; here, we describe functional insights obtained from a subset of the models. These insights derive in part from the distribution of evolutionarily conserved residues in the models, as conserved sequence motifs tend to mark functional sites in structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Villar and Kauvar, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pei and Grishin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muth et al., 2012</xref>).

The enzyme has two integral membrane subunits (CydA and CydB) with three hemes (heme b595, heme b558, and heme d) that mediate transfer of electrons from quinol to oxygen. Using the co-evolution-guided structure prediction protocol described above, we generated models for the structures of CydA and CydB, and then docked the subunits together using inter-protein predicted contacts as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ovchinnikov et al. (2014)</xref> to generate a model for the entire TM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The models of CydA and CydB share the same fold—a duplicated four helix bundle unit—and form a pseudo symmetric heterodimer. Structure comparisons of CydA and CydB to the PDB revealed nearly full-length structural similarity to polysulfide reductase TM domain (PsrC) (PDB: 2VPX), an enzyme complex responsible for the quinone-mediated reduction of polysulfide, and structure comparisons for the four helix bundle unit revealed strong similarities to cyt b561 (PDB: 4O7G). The b595 and b558 heme-binding sites of each CydA four helix bundle have been mapped experimentally by mutagenesis: H19 ligates heme b595, and H186 and M393, heme b558. Strikingly, in our model, these residues are aligned with conserved axial ligands in cyt b561 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Residues ligating heme d have not yet been identified experimentally, but in our model, a third conserved CydA histidine, H126 structurally aligns to a known heme-binding site near the cytoplasmic surface of cyt b561. We hypothesize that this residue ligates heme d, which has been proposed to be on the periplasmic side (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), a location of heme d near the cytoplasm could explain the proton-motive force generated across the membrane. In addition to the heme-ligating residues, mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borisov et al., 2011</xref>) have identified residues involved in quinone binding and proton flow. In our model of the structure of CydA, the quinone-binding residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, red spheres) cluster together, and the proton channel residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, blue spheres) cluster together. Two additional conserved residues with no known function (R9 and R448) are near the quinone-binding Q loop on the periplasmic surface. Thus, the CydA model agrees with extensive mutagenesis data and places the cytochrome bd–I complex within the evolutionary context of other TM di-heme cytochromes.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09248.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Predicted structure of the Cytochrome bd oxidase complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Location of the top co-evolving residue pairs in our model.

TtdA is homologous to the N terminus of a class I fumarase, and TtdB, to the C terminus of the fumarase. The structures of TtdA and the fumarase N-terminus have not been determined, but the structure of the fumarase C-terminal domain has been solved (PDB: 2ISB) and is structurally related to the swiveling domain from aconitase enzymes that perform similar chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lauble et al., 1994</xref>). The TtdB-like swiveling domain from aconitase (PDB: 1ACO) binds its substrate near the interface of the swiveling domain and another catalytic domain that binds 4Fe-4S. Given the importance of the adjacent catalytic domain as well as the domain interface in aconitase, we predicted the structure of TtdA and assembled it into the hetero-tetramer complex with a homology model of TtdB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In our complex model, three conserved TtdA cysteines (C71, C190, and C277) cluster near the TtdB interface which maybe the 4Fe-4S cluster-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This potential active site also includes a conserved aspartate (D73) that might contribute to catalysis. The conserved TtdB H265 falls on the opposite side of the active site in our model and instead contributes to the active site of the second TtdB chain formed by the tetramer.

Each of these families have thousands of members (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, column 2), hence these models have quite broad impact. The analyses of a small subset of these structures provided here only begins to uncover the wealth of information relating to function they contain. In addition to the new structure-based interpretation of existing sequence conservation and mutational data the models enable, they illustrate the complex transformations occurring in membrane protein evolution: for example, the changes in YeiH and RarD structural element connectivity compared to previously known structures. With the advent of sensitive sequence profile–profile comparison methods, much of protein structure modeling has been reduced to sequence alignment, and indeed for functional interpretation often much can be learned simply by draping the query sequence on a homologous structure; in contrast, as illustrated in the examples above, in the co-evolution-guided de novo structure prediction case, structure modeling is critical to functional insight.</p><p>Large-scale genome sequencing is having an unanticipated impact on protein structure modeling, enabling accurate protein structure and protein complex modeling using co-evolution-based predicted contacts. The importance of this approach to structural biology over the next decade will depend on the balance between two opposing trends: as more organisms are sequenced, the number of protein families with sufficient sequences for accurate modeling will increase, but as more structures are determined, there are fewer families for which accurate models cannot be produced by reliable comparative modeling methods. An increase in the number of eukaryotes sequenced—for example, by projects such as the recent Tara Ocean expedition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bork et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sunagawa et al., 2015</xref>)—would make it possible to accurately model a large number of eukaryote-specific protein families of considerable biological interest. Because of the comparative difficulty in experimental structure determination, it is likely that co-evolution-based prediction will continue to have the most impact for membrane proteins.</p><p>In this article, we present models for half of the large protein families in prokaryotes which do not currently have structures. The value of a comparable number of structures of eukaryotic protein families may justify the investment in genome sequencing of a diverse set of ∼400 simple eukaryotes. For proteins not belonging to sufficiently large or diverse families but for which functional selections have been developed, it should be possible to develop experimental sequence covariation data sets by library generation, functional selection, and next generation sequencing. Significant resources were invested in the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI), with the initial goal ‘to make the three-dimensional, atomic-level structures of most proteins easily obtainable from knowledge of their corresponding DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burley et al., 2008</xref>)’. It is notable that structure models can now be generated for exactly the original class of proteins targeted by the PSI—large protein families without any available information—but at a small fraction of the cost.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Multiple sequence alignment generation</title><p>Protein-coding genes were extracted from the <italic>E. coli</italic> (AUP000000625), <italic>B.</italic> subtilis (AUP000001570), <italic>H. salinarum</italic> (AUP000000554), <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> (AUP000001974) reference genomes in the UniProt proteome database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">UniProt Consortium, 2014</xref>).

Distance restraints were implemented as sigmoidal functions of the form: restraint(d) = weight(1 + exp(−slope(d − cutoff)) + intercept), where d is the distance between the constrained Cβ atoms (Cα in the case of glycine), the distance cutoffs and slopes are amino acid pair specific (SI Table 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>), and the weight is the normalized Gremlin score multiplied by three to give the contact restraints roughly the same total dynamic range as the Rosetta energy. These distance restraints supplement the Rosetta energy function; the combination ensures the sampling of physically realistic structures consistent with the contact predictions. For TM proteins, the Rosetta energy function was modified to reflect the exposure of non-polar residues in the membrane-spanning regions: the lazaridis-karplus solvation energy term weight was set to zero (fa_sol = 0.00), and to compensate for the short range repulsion implicit in the solvation model, the Lennard-Jones repulsive and attractive terms were given equal weights. We found this simple approach was equally effective and considerably less computationally intensive than the RosettaMembrane approach, which requires estimating the TM region for energy evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Model generation</title><p>The Rosetta ab initio protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simons et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rohl et al., 2004</xref>) was used to generate 10,000 independent models guided by the covariance-derived restraints. For the benchmark set, fragments database from 2011 was used; for aquaporin, the fragments were filtered to remove any homologs with e-value &lt; 1. After the generation of fragments for aquaporin, we examined the PDB files that contributed the most to the fragment set and verified that they did not contain aquaporin-like structures. The models generated by Rosetta ab initio were refined with an iterative version of the RosettaCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Song et al., 2013</xref>) hybridization protocol used to refine models generated with contact information in CASP10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). In each iteration, 20 models are produced by recombination and minimization. In addition to the recombination of secondary structure chunks in the input models, fragment insertion was allowed in all positions. Iterations were continued until the procedure converged. For a 200-residue protein, the average runtime to produce a single model is about 30 min for RosettaAB and about 20 min for RosettaCM.</p><p>If in the initial Rosetta ab initio calculations, the top 10 models selected by restraint score converged (average pairwise TMscore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang and Skolnick, 2004</xref>] &gt; 0.8), the top five models were input directly into the iterative RosettaCM hybridization protocol. If models converged over substructures (average pairwise TMscore between 0.5 and 0.8), the top 10 models were first expanded by recombination to a population of 1000 structures, and the top five models were input into the RosettaCM hybridization protocol. If the Rosetta ab initio calculations did not converge (average pairwise TMscore &lt;0.5), we carried out an additional 10,000 Rosetta ab initio trajectories; if the top models did not converge, we considered the structure of the protein not accurately predictable using our approach. 15 of the 121 families were eliminated at this stage. We also eliminated families for which the models generated by the hybridization protocol did not satisfy the predicted contacts; 37 additional families were eliminated at this step.</p><p>Proteins over 400 amino acids for which there was little convergence of the lowest energy generated models were parsed into multiple domains (&lt;200 residues) guided by the predicted contact information keeping overlaps of at least 50 residues between each domain, and Rosetta ab initio was used to generate models for each domain separately. If the overlapping regions in each domain converged during modeling, these were used to assemble the full model, otherwise the domains were trimmed to converged residues and docked using RosettaDock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaudhury et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>If models converged overall in the Rosetta ab initio calculations but specific sets of contact restraints were consistently violated, we explored the possibility that the violations correspond to interactions between monomers in a homo-oligomer.

For the server comparison, we chose to predict contacts using the PLM option as this is very similar to GREMLIN.<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09248.025</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Comparison of methods on CASP11 targets</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09248.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09248.025</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="2">BAKER<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></th><th colspan="2">Jones-UCL<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></th><th colspan="2">Evfold-web server</th></tr><tr><th>Targets</th><th>Cα-RMSD</th><th>GDT-TS</th><th>Cα-RMSD</th><th>GDT_TS</th><th>Cα-RMSD</th><th>GDT-TS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>T0806</td><td>3.6</td><td>60.4</td><td>6.8</td><td>34.3</td><td>8.2</td><td>30.0</td></tr><tr><td>T0824</td><td>4.2</td><td>55.3</td><td>9.2</td><td>41.4</td><td>8.1</td><td>32.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>*</label><p>Full-length Cα-RMSD and GDT-TS calculation based on the best of five models submitted to CASP11 from BAKER and Jones-UCL groups.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yibing Shan (Reviewing editor) and Nir Ben-Tal (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Ovchinnikov et al. represents a bold attempt in predicting structures of proteins without structural templates. The predictions rely on a physical model (Rosetta conformational search) guided by residue–residue contacts derived from a large number of protein sequences. The latter has been an important source of progress in the field of protein structure prediction in recent years. Using evolutionary data in conjunction with a well-calibrated physical model is a more recent development. This manuscript reports atomic-details structural models of 58 proteins, each represents a large prokaryotic protein family of no 3D structures available. While the accuracy of these models will be examined against the crystal structures when they are available, there are reasons to feel optimistic given the impressive performance of the program in the CASP11 blind test. Importantly, these models are available online and some interesting lessons will be learned regardless of the outcome.</p><p>In spite of years of structure determination efforts using X-ray crystallography and other experimental techniques, including the various structural genomics projects, the structure of many important proteins has yet to be determined. To some extent, structure prediction can supplement this. Structures of query proteins can be predicted if suitable templates can be detected. However, this approach is limited by our current ability to assign templates to the queries. This situation is changing now because of two major breakthroughs. First, protein sequence data are becoming available at ever increasing rate. With this data there are now hundreds and thousands of homologues for many proteins. With this, we can think of large protein families, rather than single proteins. The second breakthrough is the emergence of new algorithms for accurate detection of evolutionary couplings between pair of amino acids in large multiple alignment of homologues, and the ability to translate these into distance restraints on the relative locations of the amino acid pair in the 3D protein structure. The premise here is that the detected evolutionary coupling (coevolution, compensatory mutations) results from evolutionary pressure, and is therefore indicative of direct contact.</p><p>Recently the Baker's lab introduced its own variant for the detection of coevolution. The improvements over previous implementations of coevolution are (<bold>A</bold>) making the distance restraint depended on the strength of the coevolution signal, (<bold>B</bold>) applying restrains between pairs of amino acids that are close in sequence first and adding restraints between remote residues later in the simulation to avoid trapping in wrong conformations, and (<bold>C</bold>) using the ROSETTA framework.</p><p>In the current manuscript, the Baker group joins forces with the Grishin lab in a large-scale application of this tool for predicting the structure of 58 of the most popular protein families in bacteria. This is a well thought of and highly important project, and the manuscript reads really well. The scale is particularly impressive; with so many predicted structures the impact of the work is likely to be high. Modeling was carried out professionally (for the most part, see comments below).</p><p>Essential points to address:</p><p>1) While the results of CASP11 blind test are important and indicative, they cannot serve as a systematic and direct assessment of the accuracy of Rosetta-GREMLIN. It is necessary to directly compare the accuracy of Rosetta-GREMLIN with other leading methods, particularly EVFOLD. With such comparisons, the extent of progress in terms of prediction accuracy brought by this new method will be more clear and the authors' claims of unprecedented accuracy can be measured in specific metrics (e.g. Ca RMSD or TM score) and calibrated appropriately.</p><p>2) The angle and the motivation of this paper is reminiscent of the previous paper by Hopf et al. (Cell, 2012), which reported structure predictions, through exploiting evolutions covariance, for a relative larger number of membrane proteins without experimentally resolved structures. Of course the methodology is different here, but additional discussion of previous work along this line will help place the current work in an historical context. There have been structural predictions for some membrane proteins this paper discussed (e.g. adiponectin receptor and YeiH transporters). Briefly discussing these previous predictions and comparing them with the predictions by Rosetta-GREMLIN is needed.</p><p>3) The paragraphs in the Introduction describing the method are too long, too technical, and difficult to read. The Introduction should describe the method at a high level in a language accessible by a general audience and the technical details should be moved to the Methods. One reviewer summed up the new ingredients of this method as (<bold>A</bold>) making the distance restraint depended on the strength of the coevolution signal, (<bold>B</bold>) applying restrains between pairs of amino acids that are close in sequence first and adding restraints between remote residues later in the simulation to avoid trapping in wrong conformations, and (<bold>C</bold>) using the ROSETTA framework. This apt summary could be considered as a framework for a brief description of the method.</p><p>4) As one reviewer pointed out, much of the descriptive text concerning the specific structure models is too detailed with not enough motivation. A substantial portion of such text could go in a supplement so that the main discoveries are more visible.

However, we appreciate the question of reviewer II about how much the increased computer time required for Rosetta structure predictions increases model accuracy, and more generally, the need for a more thorough comparison to existing methods, in particular EVFOLD. We have added to the manuscript a table comparing the Rosetta-GREMLIN method to the other methods for both the CASP targets and the membrane protein benchmark. For the CASP targets, we compare to the results of Jones who made submissions for the same targets for CASP. For EVFOLD, we used the excellent EVFOLD web server since EVFOLD did not officially participate in CASP11. For the membrane protein set, we do not compare to the benchmark/results of the previously published Evfold paper, as it would be unfair, given there were far less available sequences then and a less accurate contact prediction method (mfDCA) was used. For the comparison in the paper, the alignments we used were provided as input to the Evfold-webserver, and a contact prediction method very similar to GREMLIN (PLM) was selected. The EVFOLD web server returns 50 models, we computed the CA RMSD and GDT-TS for each of them, and selected the best one. The table compares this “best out of 50” selection to the single Rosetta-GREMLIN model chosen without knowledge of the correct structure as described in the text. We emphasize in the text that while the Rosetta models are more accurate, the EVFOLD models require orders of magnitude less computing time.</p><p><italic>2) The angle and the motivation of this paper is reminiscent of the previous paper by Hopf et al.

As described in the submitted manuscript, our adiponectin prediction is similar to the EVfold prediction, while in the other overlap case (EamA) the two models are quite different.
