We recently identified peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an enzyme required for generating amidated bioactive signaling peptides, in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and mammalian cilia. Here, we show that PAM is required for the normal assembly of motile and primary cilia in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, planaria and mice. <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> PAM knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone, had abnormal Golgi architecture and altered levels of cilia assembly components. Decreased PAM gene expression reduced motile ciliary density on the ventral surface of planaria and resulted in the appearance of cytosolic axonemes lacking a ciliary membrane. The architecture of primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in <italic>Pam<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse embryos was also aberrant. Our data suggest that PAM activity and alterations in post-Golgi trafficking contribute to the observed ciliogenesis defects and provide an unanticipated, highly conserved link between PAM, amidation and ciliary assembly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25728.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25728.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25728.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal cells produce many small proteins known as peptides that help cells to communicate with each other. To become active, many of these peptides need to be chemically modified. PAM is the only enzyme that carries out a type of peptide modification called amidation and it is essential for animals to grow and survive.</p><p>PAM was originally thought to have evolved in the nervous system of animals, but recent studies have found that it is also present in green algae and in hair-like projections known as cilia, which are found on the surface of most animal cells. There are two types of cilia: motile cilia beat rhythmically and are responsible for moving cells and fluids, while non-motile cilia sense the external environment and serve as signaling hubs. These observations suggest that PAM may have other roles in cells in addition to activating peptides.</p><p>Kumar et al. now set out to investigate the role of PAM in green algae, flatworms and mice. The results show that PAM is important for the formation of both motile and non-motile cilia. Reducing the levels of PAM in the algae and flatworms resulted in short stubs forming on the surface of cells instead of motile cilia. This reduced the ability of flatworms to glide around their environment. Furthermore, the cells of mutant mice lacking PAM produced non-motile cilia that were much shorter than those produced by normal mouse cells.</p><p>Further experiments suggest that PAM may be involved in the transport of certain proteins to the sites where new cilia will form. The findings of Kumar et al. reveal a link between the PAM enzyme, amidation and the assembly of cilia. The next step will be to identify the molecules that are modified by PAM and work out exactly how amidated products might regulate the formation of cilia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25728.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25728.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>chlamdyomonas</kwd><kwd>planaria</kwd><kwd>amidation</kwd><kwd>golgi</kwd><kwd>peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK032949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eipper</surname><given-names>Betty A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM051293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Stephen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM042143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merchant</surname><given-names>Sabeeha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, planaria and mice reveals a novel and unanticipated role for a peptide amidating enzyme in primary and motile ciliary assembly through effects on post-Golgi trafficking.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cilia are ancient microtubule-based organelles derived from the basal body, and were present in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2011</xref>). The signaling potential of primary cilia and the added ability of motile cilia to generate propulsive force established them as key organelles required for the development and homeostasis of diverse cell types and organisms. The protein and lipid complements of the cilium are distinct from the rest of the cell; more than 700 proteins and specific lipids such as sterols are enriched in this intricate structure. Thus, the biogenesis and maintenance of these complex organelles is a tightly regulated cell type specific event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsiao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nachury et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lechtreck, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taschner and Lorentzen, 2016</xref>). Disruption of ciliogenesis or ciliary function leads to ciliopathies, a group of multisystemic diseases that have partially overlapping, often severe phenotypes, highlighting the importance of understanding these processes in different cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Witman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fliegauf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Waters and Beales, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The roles of microtubule motors and intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins in trafficking the cargo proteins required to build and maintain ciliary architecture have been well described. The growing cilium also relies on the delivery of membrane vesicles and proteins derived from the Golgi, and disruption of the secretory pathway by brefeldin A inhibits ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dentler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haller and Fabry, 1998</xref>). Additionally, proteins and complexes involved in polarized vesicular trafficking such as the clathrin adaptor protein-1 complex (AP1), Rabs and Arf/Arl proteins, the exocyst and BBS complexes are critical for cilium biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsiao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zuo et al., 2009</xref>). The signaling processes coordinating these pathways and regulating ciliogenesis are poorly understood.</p><p>Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), a secretory pathway-localized enzyme, catalyzes one of the final steps in the biosynthesis of many signaling peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumar et al., 2016a</xref>). PAM-catalyzed C-terminal amidation confers bioactivity to secreted peptides such as oxytocin, vasopressin and neuropeptide Y. The two enzymatic domains of PAM act sequentially on glycine-extended peptide precursors. Peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) catalyzes the copper and ascorbate dependent hydroxylation of the α-carbon of the terminal glycine, and peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine α-amidating lyase (PAL) cleaves the N-C bond, generating glyoxylate and the α-amidated peptide. PAM is a type I integral membrane protein containing a cytosolic domain that is not essential for catalytic activity, but is necessary for routing the enzyme through the secretory and endocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Milgram et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Based on a phylogenetic study identifying PAM-like genes in green algal genomes, we recently demonstrated the presence of active enzyme in the unicellular eukaryote, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attenborough et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar et al., 2016b</xref>). Despite the evolutionary distance between green algae and mammals, the biochemical properties of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> PAM (CrPAM) are remarkably similar to those of rat PAM. In both species, the full-length enzyme is membrane tethered, with its two catalytic domains, PHM and PAL, residing in the secretory pathway lumen. We also demonstrated that the catalytic domains of CrPAM can be separated from its transmembrane and cytosolic domains, leading to the generation of soluble bifunctional enzyme that can be secreted from cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>The striking evolutionary co-occurrence of organisms containing PAM-like genes and cilia prompted us to explore PAM localization in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. Using an antibody recognizing the cytosolic domain of CrPAM, we found that this enzyme is present in the Golgi and cilia (<italic>aka</italic> flagella). PAM was also observed in motile and primary cilia of mammalian cells (tracheal epithelial cells, fibroblasts, spermatozoa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar et al., 2016b</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cilia, PAM activity displayed an unexpected, strong biochemical association with the axonemal superstructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar et al., 2016b</xref>). Together, these observations in multiple cell types suggested that PAM has a novel and highly conserved signaling or sensory function in eukaryotic cilia. Here we demonstrate that PAM plays a key conserved role during the early steps of ciliogenesis, revealing a novel link between amidation and cilium assembly in multiple cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Knockdown of PAM expression disrupts ciliogenesis in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic></title><p>To explore the function of PAM in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, we designed an artificial microRNA (amiRNA2) targeted to the 5’ region of the CrPAM gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); expression was under control of the strong, constitutive promoter, HSP70A-RBSC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Molnar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schroda et al., 2000</xref>).

Images procured under similar exposure settings confirmed reduction of CrPAM levels in PAM-amiRNA strain #8 when compared to the empty vector control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar et al., 2016b</xref>), most of the PAM protein localized to the Golgi region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while a small fraction (7% of total PAM activity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was present along the length of the cilia (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) in the empty vector controls. Most strikingly, staining for acetylated tubulin confirmed the absence of cilia in both knockdown lines. Although cilia were robustly stained in control cells, only cell body microtubules were visible in the PAM-amiRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To explore the possibility of the formation of short ciliary stubs in the PAM-amiRNA mutants, we utilized scanning electron microscopy. Most control cells had two cilia that were each ~10 µm in length. In contrast, cilia were never observed on cells of either knockdown strain; only short ciliary stubs were visible (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). PAM-amiRNA cells otherwise appeared morphologically normal in size and shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Both knockdown strains grew at the same rate as controls in both acetate-containing and minimal media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, growth under both photoautotrophic (CO<sub>2</sub> as the sole carbon source assimilated by photosynthesis) and photoheterotrophic (using acetate as a carbon source) conditions was unaltered.

Iron deficiency conditions (0.5 μM vs 20 μM Fe) stimulate the secretion of FEA1, an iron assimilation protein that is readily identifiable after electrophoretic separation of the spent medium, which in cell wall-less strains contains the secreted protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2007</xref>). Spent medium normalized to equal cell protein was analyzed by silver staining. As expected, the 40 kDa FEA1 protein was readily detected in all strains under iron deficiency conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). However, secretion of FEA1 was decreased in the PAM amiRNA strains compared to controls. Furthermore, there were striking differences in the secretome in PAM knockdown cells even under basal conditions (arrowheads and brackets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Surprisingly, FEA1 transcript levels were two-fold higher in PAM amiRNA cells than in controls, perhaps reflecting a compensatory measure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We next cultured cells under phosphate-deficient conditions, which stimulates secretion of alkaline phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Quisel et al., 1996</xref>) or sulfate-deficient conditions, which stimulates secretion of arylsulfatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Hostos et al., 1988</xref>). Cellular alkaline phosphatase activity levels were indistinguishable in phosphate-deficient control and PAM amiRNA cells; however, alkaline phosphatase secretion was greatly attenuated in PAM amiRNA strains compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). In contrast, secretion of arylsulfatase by sulfate-deprived cells did not differ in PAM amiRNA and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that the effect of PAM loss on secretion is selective and not a result of generalized Golgi dysfunction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>PAM plays a critical role in the assembly of motile and primary cilia</title><p>Our work has identified PAM as a crucial, evolutionarily conserved factor that is required for ciliogenesis in multiple cell types. PAM is important for the biogenesis of the motile cilia present in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and on the ventral epithelium of planaria, as well as the normal assembly of the primary cilia of neuroepithelial cells in mammals. In <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, reduction of PAM did not alter cell growth rate but led to a dramatic loss of cilia, with assembly failing beyond the transition zone; the ciliary stubs contained amorphous electron dense material thought to consist of IFT particles and short pieces of microtubules at abnormal orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Although basal body docking and cell division were comparable to control cells, extension of the microtubules from the basal body was disrupted in PAM amiRNA cells, similar to the phenotype of mutants defective for IFT88 and IFT46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pazour et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Analyzing the roles of monofunctional PHM and bifunctional membrane PAM in planaria revealed additional complexities in the regulation of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Planarians progressively showed motility defects as the PAM genes were silenced over the three-week treatment. PHM activity was reduced to a similar extent in <italic>Smed-phm(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>Smed-pam(RNAi)</italic> animals and to a greater extent when expression of both genes was reduced. Our RNAi analysis revealed a predominant role for PHM in gliding velocity; simultaneous knockdown of soluble PHM and membrane PAM resulted in a more robust defect in ciliogenesis than knockdown of either single gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the double knockdown animals, we observed a striking loss of motile cilia and the ectopic localization of fully assembled axonemes in the cytoplasm of cells in the ventral epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–K</xref>). Thus, along with extension of the microtubules from basal bodies docked at the plasma membrane, PAM activity may be important for proper docking of the ciliary vesicle and orienting the basal body. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ‘exposed’ axonemes in the cytoplasm of multiciliated cells in metazoans. A few studies reported the occurrence of microtubules in the cytoplasm in the absence of ciliary genes, but it is not clear that these microtubules formed an axonemal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boisvieux-Ulrich et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Park et al., 2006</xref>). The complete lack of a ciliary membrane around the apparently fully-assembled 9 + 2 axonemal structure raises the possibility that the supply of membrane to the growing cilium is a key limiting factor in the <italic>Smed-phm+pam(RNAi)</italic> animals.</p><p>While reduction of PAM in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and planaria resulted in a dramatic defect in ciliary assembly, complete loss of PAM in mice did not abolish primary cilia formation in neuroepithelial cells, although they were significantly shorter than cilia in wild type animals and in many cases only ciliary stubs were evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is unknown if these short cilia are functional.</p><p>Why does loss of PAM lead to closely related, yet pleomorphic defects in ciliogenesis in different organisms? The answer is unclear, but differences in the pathways utilized for assembling cilia in various cell types may contribute to the different phenotypes observed. Indeed, distinct cell- and organism-specific phenotypes have been observed when ciliary genes are mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lechtreck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lechtreck and Witman, 2007</xref>). Multiciliated epithelial cells and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells utilize an extracellular pathway of ciliogenesis, where the basal body first docks at a distinct region of the plasma membrane and ciliary extension into the extracellular environment is a result of axonemal growth. In contrast, fibroblasts and neuroepithelial cells employ an intracellular pathway of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>), where growth of the axoneme is initiated inside a ciliary vesicle in the cytoplasm. Docking of the ciliary vesicle subsequently leads to emergence of the cilium outward from the cell surface. Key steps in these ciliogenic pathways may exhibit differential sensitivity to the lack of PAM in distinct organisms and tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PAM deficiency alters Golgi ultrastructure, function and post-Golgi trafficking</title><p>The Golgi serves as a sorting station for proteins targeted to the secretory pathway, endosomes and lysosomes and the Golgi region is the main site of PAM localization in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar et al., 2016b</xref>); after exocytosis, mammalian PAM traverses the endocytic pathway, returning to the trans-Golgi network. The Golgi supplies membrane proteins required for ciliary expansion; vesicles carrying ciliary cargo must be assembled and trafficked to the growing ciliary base. Loss of PAM in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> altered Golgi architecture; Golgi stacks were more curved in PAM amiRNA cells than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,E</xref>). Golgi morphology is affected by the cytoskeleton and Golgi matrix, and mechanical and structural alterations to the Golgi are known to affect the formation of vesicles and tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guet et al., 2014</xref>). In agreement with alterations in Golgi function, PAM amiRNA <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells had enlarged starch grains, a response known to reflect defects in the secretory pathway and the trafficking of metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hummel et al., 2010</xref>). Although, we observed defects in secretion of FEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>) and alkaline phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>), arylsulfatase secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>) and contractile vacuole function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>) were unaffected in PAM knockdown strains, pointing to selective, rather than global, changes in vesicular trafficking.</p><p>The primarily Golgi-localized AP1 complex, known to be important for bi-directional trafficking of proteins between endosomes, secretory granules and the trans-Golgi network, has also been implicated in the ciliary trafficking of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaplan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dwyer et al., 2001</xref>). The μ1A subunit of AP1 interacts with the cytosolic domain of PAM; reducing μ1A expression impairs the formation of mature, secretagogue-responsive secretory granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnemaison et al., 2014</xref>). Mature secretory vesicles lack clathrin; clathrin-coated vesicles bud from immature secretory granules, which are localized near the trans-Golgi network. Clathrin levels were almost double that of control cells in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> PAM amiRNA strains, again suggesting that aspects of vesicular trafficking are abnormal in these cells. Thus, alterations in post-Golgi trafficking to the cilium might contribute to defects in ciliogenesis in PAM-deficient cells.</p><p>Although the levels of most of the IFT proteins analyzed were unchanged, PAM amiRNA cells displayed a striking increase in the retrograde trafficking IFT-A component, IFT139. IFT components normally assemble into IFT trains at the base of the cilium, displaying a peri-basal body distribution along with punctate staining in the cilium. In PAM amiRNA cells, several IFT-B components accumulated in the ciliary stubs and staining at the base of the stubs was decreased, suggesting disrupted transition zone function. The transition zone at the proximal end of the cilium is a site of protein sorting and trafficking that is critical for ciliogenesis. Mutations in transition zone components lead to ciliopathies such as Meckel-Gruber and Joubert syndromes. We were unable to identify distinct Y linkers in our PAM amiRNA <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells. Strikingly, although levels of transcripts encoding CEP290 and NPHP4 were unaltered in PAM amiRNA knockdown cells, levels of CEP290 protein, a component of the Y linkers and NPHP4 protein, a distal transition zone component, were elevated substantially. Furthermore, Golgi disruption by brefeldin A did not cause a similar increase in NPHP4 levels, pointing to a PAM-specific effect distinct from general Golgi dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). CEP290 still localized to the base of the cilium in PAM amiRNA cells, but additional foci of CEP290 staining were visible elsewhere in the cell. Together, our biochemical and ultrastructural data suggest that transition zone function is compromised in PAM amiRNA mutant cells. Post-transcriptional control mechanisms appear to play an important role in these responses, since these changes in IFT and transition zone protein levels do not occur at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting that there may not be a simple direct connection between the expression of known ciliary proteins and PAM. Post-transcriptional or protein stability changes that contribute to variations in the levels of these proteins in the absence of PAM need further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Possible mechanisms for the effects of PAM on ciliary assembly</title><p>Given the recognized roles of PAM in membrane trafficking mediated by its cytosolic domain, a key question is whether it is PAM protein per se or its enzymatic (amidating) activity that is the key factor in ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). Currently, four results point to a requirement for active PAM enzyme and an amidated product in ciliary assembly. First, <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> CrPAM-ΔCD cells, with a PAM protein that lacks most of its C-terminal domain, are capable of assembling a cilium. Second, treatment of wildtype <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells with a mechanism-based PHM inhibitor (4-phenyl-3-butenoic acid, PBA) delayed ciliary regrowth following deciliation. Third, mammalian PHM has a relatively low affinity for copper, and copper chelation is routinely used to inhibit PHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mains et al., 1986</xref>). Treatment of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells with the copper-selective chelator neocuproine mimics the effects of PBA on reciliation. Finally, knockdown of the <italic>Smed-phm</italic> gene, which encodes soluble PHM, alters planarian cilium biogenesis; the bifunctional <italic>Smed-pam</italic> gene is unable to compensate for its loss.</p><p>How might amidation influence cilium assembly? While a secreted, bioactive peptide product may act as a positive regulator of ciliogenesis, glycine-extended lipids are also PAM substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Merkler et al., 2004</xref>). The synthesis of oleamide, an amidated lipid, in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line was recently shown to require PAM; siRNA mediated knockdown of PAM resulted in accumulation of the N-acylglycine precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jeffries et al., 2016</xref>). Amidated lipids produced by PAM could generate lipid sub-domains in the secretory pathway and serve to enrich secretory pathway localized proteins into specialized vesicles. In support of this model, we find PAM loss selectively alters post-Golgi trafficking in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. Furthermore, doxycycline-induced expression of membrane PAM in mouse pituitary tumor cells has a profound effect on post-Golgi trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciccotosto et al., 1999</xref>). Soluble cargo proteins are diverted away from the regulated secretory pathway and constitutive secretion is increased. This effect is attributed, in part, to striking changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciccotosto et al., 1999</xref>), which may be mediated through interactions of the cytosolic domain of PAM with actin regulatory proteins.</p><p>A connection between actin and PAM is particularly intriguing since actin is required for basal body orientation and docking in multi-ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boisvieux-Ulrich et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meunier and Azimzadeh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Park et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, conventional actin is found near the Golgi complex and in ciliary inner arm dynein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kato-Minoura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Piperno and Luck, 1981</xref>), and participates in linking ciliary assembly to ciliary length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avasthi et al., 2014</xref>). Pharmacological studies and unbiased screens have revealed complex roles for the actin cytoskeleton in controlling primary ciliogenesis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phua et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nager et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2012</xref>). The small pool of PAM located in the cilium may also be essential for ciliogenesis. Identifying the domains/regions of PAM necessary for its localization to the cilium will be important to address this issue.</p><p>Our PBA and neocuproine studies indicate that wildtype cells can regrow cilia even when PHM activity has been inhibited. Thus, it is possible that cilia can regrow in the absence of enzymatically active PAM provided that all the necessary structures (such as attached basal bodies, functional IFT machinery <italic>etc</italic>) are already available. However, as <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> stockpiles sufficient components to regenerate two approximately half-length cilia in the absence of additional protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rosenbaum et al., 1969</xref>), it is also possible that these cells, which initially contain wild type levels of enzymatically active PAM, already have enough amidated products available to allow ciliogenesis to occur, albeit in a delayed manner.</p><p>The evolutionarily widespread occurrence of the PAM gene and the results presented here suggest that at least one of the ancestral and conserved roles of PAM is in ciliary assembly. The prevailing theory of ciliary evolution is that polarized trafficking of signaling proteins and receptors from the Golgi complex using coat proteins, such as IFT and COP proteins, gave rise to a plasma membrane sensory patch that ultimately gained a microtubule backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jekley Jékely and Arendt, 2006</xref>). It is possible that PAM was included in the set of signaling proteins trafficked to the ciliary compartment from the Golgi in the ancestral eukaryote. In conclusion, our results suggest that both the amidation and membrane trafficking roles of PAM contribute to ciliogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> strains and culture conditions</title><p>Two miRNAs targeting <italic>C. reinhardtii CrPAM</italic> were designed according to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Molnar et al., 2009</xref>) using the WMD3 tool at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wmd3.weigelworld.org/.">http://wmd3.weigelworld.org/.</ext-link> Resulting oligonucleotides for amiRNA1</p><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>PAMamiFor1</title><p>ctagtAAGACGAGCCACCCCAATGTAtctcgctgatcggcaccatgggggtggtggtgatcagcgctaTACAATGGGGTGGCTCGTCTTg;</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>PAMamiRev1</title><p>ctagcAAGACGAGCCACCCCATTGTAtagcgctgatcaccaccacccccatggtgccgatcagcgagaTACATTGGGGTGGCTCGTCTTa and amiRNA2</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>PAMamiFor2</title><p>ctagtCCGGTTCTTGTTAGCTGCTCAtctcgctgatcggcaccatgggggtggtggtgatcagcgctaTGAGTGGCTAACAAGAACCGGg;</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>PAMamiRev2</title><p>ctagcCCGGTTCTTGTTAGCCACTCAtagcgctgatcaccaccacccccatggtgccgatcagcgagaTGAGCAGCTAACAAGAACCGGa (uppercase letters representing miRNA*/miRNA sequences) were annealed by boiling and slowly cooling-down in a thermocycler and ligated into SpeI-digested pChlamiRNA2 (17).

DNase treatment was performed using Turbo DNAse (Ambion), concentrating and cleaning with the Zymo Research RNA Clean and Concentrator−5 Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For RNA-Sequencing, RNA quality and quantity were determined using a Nanodrop 2000 instrument (Thermo Scientific) and a Bioanalyzer ChiP RNA 7500 series II (Agilent). A stranded Illumina RNA-Seq library was prepared by the UCLA Clinical Microarray Core with standard Kapa RNAseq library preparation. Library quality control was performed with a Bioanalyzer Chip DNA 1000 series II (Agilent) and the libraries were quantified using Qubit. Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 1000 sequencer (Illumina) and single end 50 bp sequences were generated. Sequences were then aligned to the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> genome (v5.5) with RNA star. Relative expression estimates were generated using Cuffdiff 2.0.2.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Maya Yankova (UCHC Electron Microscopy Facility), Andrew Yanik, Taylor LaRese and Ping Wang (UCHC Neuropeptide laboratory) for outstanding technical assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes for the first time an evolutionarily conserved role of the peptide amidating enzyme, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), in cilium biogenesis. Using RNAi-mediated knockdown strategies (<italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and planarian) or PAM knockout animals (mouse), the authors show by fluorescence- and electron microscopy that loss of PAM leads to failure of ciliary assembly beyond the transition zone (TZ) in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and planarians, whereas a milder, yet still severe, ciliogenesis defect is seen in neuroepithelial cells of mutant mouse embryos. Furthermore, they provide evidence that total cellular levels of several ciliogenic factors (certain TZ and IFT proteins) are altered in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells lacking PAM. These cells also display measurable defects in the secretory pathway, including altered Golgi morphology, enlarged starch grains and defects in protein glycosylation. The authors therefore propose that PAM mainly affects ciliogenesis by regulating Golgi function and post-Golgi trafficking to cilia.</p><p>The large number of ciliopathies attests to the large number of gene products already known that participate in formation of a properly functioning cilium. The major strength of the manuscript is that it implicates an unexpected player in ciliogenesis. Thus, future research on identifying the molecular function of PAM in cells such as <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> could uncover novel steps in ciliogenesis. However, there are a number of serious concerns about the nature and specificity of the observed defects, which would need to be addressed to make this paper acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Because ciliogenesis was blocked in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> PAM knockdown (kd) cells, the authors examined expression of several cilium-related genes and found some were more highly expressed and some were expressed at lower amounts. Similarly, because the Golgi provides membrane proteins to the cilium, Golgi function was also examined in the PAM kd cells and found to be altered. These experiments were done to support favored models of the defects caused by PAM kd. It seems that a more objective approach would be to determine the effects of PAM kd on multiple structures and processes in cells, and if only those related to Golgi and ciliogenesis were affected then one could conclude that PAM functions specifically in those two systems. For example, the mitochondria in the PAM kd cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> appear much larger, more heterogenous in shape, and more vacuolated than in wild type. Is this typical? Was mitochondrial function affected by PAM kd? Photosynthesis? Autophagy? In particular, the manuscript should report whether cell cycle or growth rate properties were affected by PAM kd. One potential concern is that the cells are just unhealthy and this leads to other described phenotypes. The authors should also indicate whether the cells are in continuous light or a light-dark cycle.</p><p>2) The manuscript does not provide sufficient data to determine whether it is the PAM enzymatic activity per se that is required for ciliogenesis. As the authors point out, in some systems the cytoplasmic portion of PAM provides scaffolding/trafficking activities that appear to be independent of the enzymatic properties of PAM, and thus it could be the scaffolding activity mediated by the residual part of the cytoplasmic domain rather than the enzymatic activity that is important in ciliogenesis. Based on their results in planaria that PMH kd alone influences ciliogenesis, the authors favor the idea that PAM enzymatic activity is required for ciliogenesis. This model would be substantively strengthened if the PAM kd <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells were rescued with wild type and enzymatically inactive form of PAM. Rescue experiments are also important because without any results showing rescue of at least some of the observed phenotypes, it is unclear whether or not these changes are simply off-target effects or are specifically mediated by the PAM knock down. In this context it is somewhat disconcerting that the expression of certain BBS genes are altered in the PAM knock down cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>3) The manuscript straddles the fence on whether PAM disruption interferes with ciliogenesis directly, or whether PAM disruption alters Golgi properties and secretion and thereby only indirectly alters ciliogenesis. If the latter is correct, then the manuscript needs to do a much better job of explaining why this is such an important advance.</p><p>One suggested experiment is to assess secretion using the assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> in the insertional mutant of PAM1. Since the cyto-tail of PAM mediates Golgi localization, it is conceivable that CrPAM-∆CD fails to localize to Golgi and the CrPAM-∆CD cells are secretion defective. If this were the case, this would indicate that the ciliary defects in PAM knockdown cells are not caused by secretion defects.</p><p>4) Data analysis, presentation, quantification and interpretation:</p><p>A) The authors present a series of results indicating that PAM knockdown in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> affects the level of several proteins implicated in ciliary trafficking or function (e.g. CEP290 and NPHP4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) and that this occurs at the posttranscriptional level. But it is not clear how a defect in PAM would cause such an effect, nor is it clear if this change in protein level is a general phenomenon seen in cells lacking cilia and/or having perturbed Golgi function. One way to test this would be to determine if perturbation of Golgi in general (e.g. Brefeldin A treatment or knock down of AP-1 or clathrin etc.) or IFT (using available IFT mutant cells) causes the same effects on tubulin post translational modification and TZ protein expression as PAM knock down. It would be good to include at least some additional data on the specificity of the observed changes.</p><p>B) The manuscript asserts that the distribution of PAM antibody staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates that PAM is in the Golgi of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> without providing an independent marker for the Golgi. What is the evidence that the area indicated to be Golgi indeed is the Golgi? Also needed is a blot of whole cells documenting that the antibody stains just PAM. In this regard, an IF image of the ∆-cd mutant cells stained with the antibody that recognizes the cytoplasmic domain would be a useful negative control for the antibody.</p><p>C) The 2016 paper from this group on PAM in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> reported that PAM activity bound to the microtubules of isolated cilia. It was surprising that there was no increase in specific activity of the microtubule-associated enzyme, however, raising the question of the physiological significance of PAM in cilia. The current manuscript needs to present separate blots with equal protein and equal cell number equivalents to quantify the amount of PAM in cilia versus cell bodies in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</p><p>D) More quantitative data are needed for planaria experiments: Need to quantify percent of animals that were immotile and the frequency of reorientation of gliding direction. Did the cytoplasmic axonemes in the planaria cd cells have a basal body? Without providing the total numbers of animals counted for each sample that showed cytoplasmic axonemes, the reader cannot assess the importance of the result that 57 of the kd animals had cytoplasmic axonemes compared to 0 of the control animals.</p><p>E) Please provide quantitation to support the assertion in the subsection “PAM is required for primary cilia assembly in the developing neuroepithelium of mammals”, that ciliary density was unaffected in the pam<sup>-/-</sup> neuroepithelial cells.</p><p>F) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: Authors need to explain how it is possible to use TEM to quantify ciliary length. The SEM shows that most of the cilia are bent. Did the authors use serial sectioning for the TEM to identify the ciliary tip, which would be required to determine length? If these data are not reliable, the authors might consider removing them and using another way to quantify ciliary length.</p><p>G) The authors need to indicate how the differences in amounts of unidentified proteins detected in the Con A blots support their assertion that protein glycosylation was affected by PAM kd. As best I can tell, the Con A blots are silent about glycosylation per se; they show only that some unidentified proteins that happen to bind Con A are reduced in amount. Unless the authors can provide good arguments that this analysis indeed unambiguously reports on protein glycosylation, the data may better be removed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A bioactive peptide amidating enzyme is required for ciliogenesis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The slopes of both lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> appear to be almost identical. The line for the control is above the line for the PBA sample because the cilia in the control at 10 minutes were slightly longer, but after that the rates of increase seem similar.

To establish, as the text states, that the rates of growth were significantly different, the authors need to compare the slopes of the two lines.

Taken together with the miRNA results, one interpretation of the inhibitor experiments is that if cells possess the proper structures (properly attached basal bodies and IFT machinery, for example), then they can synthesize, transport, and assemble all of the components required to grow a cilium in the absence of PAM activity.

As stated in the original manuscript, we observed enlargement of starch grains in the PAM kd strains, without a concomitant increase in total starch. We evaluated growth of the PAM kd strains and saw no difference from EV controls. As requested by the reviewers, we now include growth curves for the EV and PAM kd strains in both minimal (M) and acetate-containing (TAP) media. These demonstrate the PAM kd strains grow at the same rate as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; subsection “Knockdown of PAM expression disrupts ciliogenesis in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>”, last paragraph). Thus, growth under both photoautotrophic (CO<sub>2</sub> as the sole carbon source assimilated by photosynthesis) and photoheterotrophic (using acetate as a carbon source) conditions is unaltered. The reviewers asked if mitochondria were larger and more heterogeneous based on the one micrograph shown. We examined numerous micrographs and found that there was no significant difference in mitochondrial organization. This clearly indicates that the PAM kd cells are generally healthy and do not exhibit major metabolic defects in chloroplast or mitochondrial function. Since membrane trafficking is essential for ciliogenesis, we examined the contractile vacuole cycle, another process that is highly dependent on membrane trafficking. We found that the PAM kd cells had a completely normal contractile vacuole cycle under standard culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>; see aforementioned paragraph). The reviewers asked if cells were grown in continuous light or a light/dark cycle – they were grown in continuous light and this is now indicated in the Methods subsection “<italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> Strains and Culture Conditions”.</p><p><italic>2) The manuscript does not provide sufficient data to determine whether it is the PAM enzymatic activity per se that is required for ciliogenesis. As the authors point out, in some systems the cytoplasmic portion of PAM provides scaffolding/trafficking activities that appear to be independent of the enzymatic properties of PAM, and thus it could be the scaffolding activity mediated by the residual part of the cytoplasmic domain rather than the enzymatic activity that is important in ciliogenesis. Based on their results in planaria that PMH kd alone influences ciliogenesis, the authors favor the idea that PAM enzymatic activity is required for ciliogenesis. This model would be substantively strengthened if the PAM kd Chlamydomonas cells were rescued with wild type and enzymatically inactive form of PAM. Rescue experiments are also important because without any results showing rescue of at least some of the observed phenotypes, it is unclear whether or not these changes are simply off-target effects or are specifically mediated by the PAM knock down. In this context it is somewhat disconcerting that the expression of certain BBS genes are altered in the PAM knock down cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</italic></p><p>To our knowledge, rescue experiments are not the normal standard used in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> amiRNA field (e.g. Zhao et al. [2009] Plant J 58: 157-164; Molnar et al. [2009] Plant J 58: 165-174; Dymek and Smith [2012] J Cell Sci 125: 3357-3366). However, we have tried the suggested rescue experiment but have been unable to express epitope-tagged versions of PAM. Therefore, to directly address the specificity of the knockdown obtained, we used a second amiRNA (amiRNA1), which targets a different region of the PAM gene (see updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and found that this also lead to reduction of PAM activity and defective ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the observed phenotypes are not the result of off-target effects from any given amiRNA. Furthermore, we examined multiple independently-derived amiRNA strains, all of which had the same phenotype; thus, as stated in the original manuscript, the observed phenotypes were not due to plasmid insertion at any one location within the genome. To directly address the role of PAM enzyme activity in ciliogenesis, we performed additional experiments in which we used two different methods to inhibit PAM activity: 4-phenyl-3-butenoic acid, a well-characterized, mechanism-based PHM inhibitor (Bradbury et al., [1990] Eur. J. Biochem. 189, 363-368), and neocuproine, a cell-permeant copper chelator (Mendelsohn et al., [2006] Cell Metabolism 4, 155-162), as the PHM-mediated hydroxylation reaction absolutely requires this metal. We found that both treatments resulted in a decrease in the rate of ciliary reassembly in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> following deflagellation by exposure to low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref> and subsection “PAM enzymatic activity is important for ciliogenesis”, last paragraph). Combined with our analysis of the C-terminal truncation mutant and the observation that reducing PHM activity alone leads to ciliary loss in planaria, these new data greatly strengthen the model that PAM enzyme activity is a key ciliogenic parameter. The reviewer comments on the observed changes in expression of two BBS genes; although flagged as significant, the measured changes are actually rather minimal (mean RPKM of 9.18 (EV) vs. 8.32 (KD) for BBS2 and 5.29 (EV) vs. 5.90 (KD) for BBS9). Therefore, we have removed reference to the BBSome.</p><p><italic>3) The manuscript straddles the fence on whether PAM disruption interferes with ciliogenesis directly, or whether PAM disruption alters Golgi properties and secretion and thereby only indirectly alters ciliogenesis. If the latter is correct, then the manuscript needs to do a much better job of explaining why this is such an important advance.</italic></p><p><italic>One suggested experiment is to assess secretion using the assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> in the insertional mutant of PAM1. Since the cyto-tail of PAM mediates Golgi localization, it is conceivable that CrPAM-∆CD fails to localize to Golgi and the CrPAM-∆CD cells are secretion defective. If this were the case, this would indicate that the ciliary defects in PAM knockdown cells are not caused by secretion defects.</italic></p><p>Our new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) clearly support a key role for PAM enzymatic activity in ciliogenesis, and thus provide a novel requirement for amidation in ciliogenesis. The active site of PAM can accommodate a variety of substrates (e.g. Merkler et al., [2004] Biochemistry 43, 12667-12674), and it is clear that PAM can produce both amidated peptides and amidated lipids (such as oleamide, which derives from an N-oleoylglycine precursor); amidated peptides or amidated lipids could link PAM activity to its trafficking roles. Although it is known that the Golgi is important for ciliogenesis, the factors controlling Golgi-cilia trafficking remain poorly understood. As indicated in the original manuscript, we did observe altered secretion of an iron assimilation protein and alkaline phosphatase in the PAM kd cells. However, we have now found that secretion of arylsulfatase, which occurs when cells are deprived of sulfur, is not altered in the PAM kd strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>). Thus, the lack of PAM leads to a selective defect in secretion from the Golgi. In addition, as mentioned above, the contractile vacuole cycle, which is heavily dependent on membrane trafficking, is unaffected in the PAM kd strain under normal conditions. The selective effect of PAM kd on post-Golgi trafficking is now more clearly described in the Discussion (subsection “PAM deficiency alters Golgi ultrastructure, function and post-Golgi trafficking”, first paragraph). Furthermore, the reviewers asked if PAM was still localized to the Golgi in the CrPAM-ΔCD strain; our new immunofluorescence data indicate that this is indeed the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Data analysis, presentation, quantification and interpretation:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) The authors present a series of results indicating that PAM knockdown in Chlamydomonas affects the level of several proteins implicated in ciliary trafficking or function (e.g. CEP290 and NPHP4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) and that this occurs at the posttranscriptional level. But it is not clear how a defect in PAM would cause such an effect, nor is it clear if this change in protein level is a general phenomenon seen in cells lacking cilia and/or having perturbed Golgi function. One way to test this would be to determine if perturbation of Golgi in general (e.g. Brefeldin A treatment or knock down of AP-1 or clathrin etc.) or IFT (using available IFT mutant cells) causes the same effects on tubulin post translational modification and TZ protein expression as PAM knock down. It would be good to include at least some additional data on the specificity of the observed changes.</italic></p><p>As much tubulin post-translational modification occurs in cilia (Wloga et al., [2016] CSH Perspective in Biology: Cilia pp. 17-30), we expected the aciliate PAM kd strain to exhibit reduced levels of acetylated and glutamylated tubulin; we have modified the Results to make this clear (subsection “PAM deficiency affects trafficking and transition zone proteins in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>”, first paragraph). The reviewers suggested we treat cells with brefeldin A to assess whether Golgi disruption caused the same effects on tubulin post-translational modification and transition zone protein expression as observed in the PAM kd strains. We treated control ciliated cells with brefeldin for 3 hours and observed a decrease in ciliary length, as shown previously (Dentler [2013] PLoS ONE 8(1): e53366). The levels of acetylated and glutamylated tubulin were decreased in both PAM kd and brefeldin-treated cells, consistent with loss of cilia. However, enhanced levels of the transition zone protein nephrocystin 4 were not observed following brefeldin treatment indicating that they are specific to PAM deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, brefeldin treatment increased Arf1 levels; no change in Arf1 levels was observed in the PAM kd strains. These data suggest that PAM defects are specific and not merely the result of generalized Golgi dysfunction.</p><p><italic>B) The manuscript asserts that the distribution of PAM antibody staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates that PAM is in the Golgi of Chlamydomonas without providing an independent marker for the Golgi. What is the evidence that the area indicated to be Golgi indeed is the Golgi? Also needed is a blot of whole cells documenting that the antibody stains just PAM. In this regard, an IF image of the ∆-cd mutant cells stained with the antibody that recognizes the cytoplasmic domain would be a useful negative control for the antibody.</italic></p><p>In mammalian cells, PAM is present in the Golgi and endocytic pathway. When <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> PAM is expressed in mammalian cells it shows a similar localization (Kumar et al. J Cell Sci 129: 943-956 [2016]). We previously demonstrated that the peri-nuclear staining of CrPAM in wildtype <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> was dispersed following treatment with brefeldin A, indicating that CrPAM was present in the Golgi; Arf1 showed a similar localization (Kumar et al. J Cell Sci 129: 943-956 [2016]). The reviewers also asked about the specificity of our PAM-CD antibody, which was characterized in our J Cell Sci paper: cell body and ciliary immunofluorescent staining were blocked by the antigenic peptide; the antibody immunoprecipitated PAM protein and activity from <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> lysates; only full-length CrPAM and the processed CD fragment were detectable by immunoblotting CrPAM-expressing HEK-293 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> of the original manuscript, this antibody did not stain PAM kd cells. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> EV and PAM kd lysates, non-specific bands are detected on immunoblots in addition to full-length PAM and the CD fragment, as now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. However, no immunofluorescent staining is observed in the CrPAM-ΔCD strain (these data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these data localize PAM to the Golgi area in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</p><p><italic>C) The 2016 paper from this group on PAM in Chlamydomonas reported that PAM activity bound to the microtubules of isolated cilia. It was surprising that there was no increase in specific activity of the microtubule-associated enzyme, however, raising the question of the physiological significance of PAM in cilia. The current manuscript needs to present separate blots with equal protein and equal cell number equivalents to quantify the amount of PAM in cilia versus cell bodies in Chlamydomonas.</italic></p><p>We are unclear why the reviewers found it surprising that, in our previous paper in J Cell Sci, we observed no increase in PAM specific activity in cilia compared to PAM in the cell body; these measurements were repeated multiple times. How much PAM is in cilia depends on many factors including the rate of trafficking through the secretory pathway, the rate of PAM entry into cilia, and its rate of loss from cilia, which might include recycling to the cell body and/or shedding in ciliary ectosomes. As requested, we quantified PHM specific activity in cilia and cell bodies and the% of the total PHM activity present in cilia <italic>vs.</italic> cell bodies; cilia contained ~7% of the total PHM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming our previous result demonstrating similar PHM specific activities in cilia and cell bodies. The ciliary membrane accounts for only a small fraction of the total cell membrane (Nachury, Phil Trans Royal Soc B 369, 20130465 [2014]). Further studies are needed to determine whether the 7% of total PAM present in this compartment performs a function distinct from PAM in the cell body.</p><p><italic>D) More quantitative data are needed for planaria experiments: Need to quantify percent of animals that were immotile and the frequency of reorientation of gliding direction. Did the cytoplasmic axonemes in the planaria cd cells have a basal body? Without providing the total numbers of animals counted for each sample that showed cytoplasmic axonemes, the reader cannot assess the importance of the result that 57 of the kd animals had cytoplasmic axonemes compared to 0 of the control animals.</italic></p><p>We now include two tables providing this information. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, for control and all experimental groups we quantified the% immotile animals, gliding velocity (mean ± SEM) and ciliary beat frequency (which was previously included in the main text). Reference to animal reorientation has been removed as it is not a readily interpretable parameter. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, we quantitated, with respect to length of epithelium examined, the number of docked basal bodies and cytosolic axonemes identified. These TEM data were obtained from two control and two knockdown animals. We have never observed cytosolic axonemes in control animals nor in our previous published knockdowns of other ciliary genes (IFT88, WDR92, outer arm dynein IC2 and LC1 and IFT dynein WDR60; Rompolas et al., Mol Biol Cell 21, 3669-3679 [2010]; Patel-King and King, Mol Biol Cell 27, 1204-1209 [2016]; Patel-King et al., Mol Biol Cell 24, 2668-2677 [2013]). It is currently uncertain whether these cytosolic axonemes emanate from a basal body; to date, we have not observed any undocked misoriented basal bodies in cross-section that might represent axoneme templating sites. This would require complete serial section reconstruction of the planaria ventral surface which is beyond the scope of this project.</p><p><italic>E) Please provide quantitation to support the assertion in the subsection “PAM is required for primary cilia assembly in the developing neuroepithelium of mammals”, that ciliary density was unaffected in the pam<sup>-/-</sup> neuroepithelial cells.</italic></p><p>Quantitation of ciliary density on pam<sup>-/-</sup> neuroepithelia was provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> of the original manuscript.</p><p><italic>F) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: Authors need to explain how it is possible to use TEM to quantify ciliary length.

We did not observe major changes in ciliary orientation by TEM even in 2 μm long cilia. We also quantified ciliary length from SEM images; these data are now provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. Both TEM and SEM data sets indicated that cilia were significantly shorter in the PAM<sup>-/-</sup> mice than in controls. It is perhaps noteworthy that the mean length of control cilia was estimated to be slightly longer by TEM than by SEM, whereas both methods gave essentially the same result for PAM<sup>-/-</sup>animals. This may reflect difficulties in accurately measuring the length of the longer bent cilia by SEM in these control animals.</p><p><italic>G) The authors need to indicate how the differences in amounts of unidentified proteins detected in the Con A blots support their assertion that protein glycosylation was affected by PAM kd. As best I can tell, the Con A blots are silent about glycosylation per se; they show only that some unidentified proteins that happen to bind Con A are reduced in amount.

In particular, the analysis and interpretation of the data describing the impact of chemical inhibitors on cilia growth needs to improved, and additional antibody validation is required.</italic></p><p><italic>1) Chemical inhibition of the rate of ciliary regrowth: The assertion that PBA and neocuproine inhibited the rate of ciliary regrowth is not supported by the evidence. The slopes of both lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> appear to be almost identical. The line for the control is above the line for the PBA sample because the cilia in the control at 10 minutes were slightly longer, but after that the rates of increase seem similar. Related to this, reporting that the individual points on the control and experimental samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> are significantly different, says only that the lengths at those times were different. To establish, as the text states, that the rates of growth were significantly different, the authors need to compare the slopes of the two lines. Another significant concern is that the X-axes for Figure I and J are not linear, this should be changed. Taken together, the data need to be completely re-assessed.</italic></p><p>On re-examining the plots, we realized that the way we presented the data may have led to a misunderstanding. We reanalyzed/replotted the data and included the zero-time point data. We made the x-axis linear for both plots, as requested (see updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). We wish to be clear that it is not that the cilia on control cells were initially longer than the cilia on inhibitor-treated cells and that this difference simply continued throughout the experiment; deflagellation of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> by pH shock leads to release of the cilia immediately distal to the transition zone (e.g. Sanders and Salisbury J Cell Biol 108, 1751-1760 [1989]). As expected, in both control and experimental treatments cilia were undetectable at the zero-time point. Thus, in the presence of the inhibitors, the absolute length of the cilia, and consequently the amount of regrowth, is significantly decreased until the latest time points. The new plots clearly indicate that it takes approximately 20-30 minutes longer for neocuproine- and PBA-treated cells to regenerate ~9.5 μm cilia. This is now stated in the text (subsection “PAM enzymatic activity is important for ciliogenesis”, last paragraph). Statistical analysis (unweighted means analysis) indicates that differences between the control and experimental curves are highly significant, with P&lt;0.0001. This is indicated in the figure legend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> legend). The term “rate” has been removed as the rate of cilia regrowth is known to change with ciliary length (e.g. Marshall et al. Mol Biol Cell 16, 270-278 [2005]). We now state that complete ciliary regrowth is delayed following the inhibitor treatments (subsection “PAM enzymatic activity is important for ciliogenesis”, last paragraph and subsection “Possible mechanisms for the effects of PAM on ciliary assembly”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Interpreting inhibitor experiments: Even if re-assessment of the ciliary regrowth data shows some effect of the inhibitors, the bigger message is that in the presence of the PAM inhibitors, cells can regrow cilia at a rate not much lower than controls, and the cilia reach nearly the same length as controls. Taken together with the miRNA results, one interpretation of the inhibitor experiments is that if cells possess the proper structures (properly attached basal bodies and IFT machinery, for example), then they can synthesize, transport, and assemble all of the components required to grow a cilium in the absence of PAM activity. This appears to be an important finding that should be highlighted more fully by the authors.</italic></p><p>The reviewer makes a good point and this is now addressed in the manuscript. Also, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> stockpiles sufficient proteins in the cytoplasm to rebuild approximately ½ length cilia without additional protein synthesis. Thus, it is also possible that these cells, which are not initially PAM-deficient, already have enough amidated product(s) available to allow for ciliogenesis to occur, albeit in a delayed fashion. We have added a comment to the manuscript (subsection “Possible mechanisms for the effects of PAM on ciliary assembly”, fourth paragraph) to highlight these points, as suggested.</p><p><italic>3) The antibody against the PAM luminal domain is not properly characterized: No evidence is presented that the PAM luminal domain antibody indeed recognizes PAM. Reactivity with a band on immunoblots that migrates similarly to PAM is wholly insufficient to validate the antibody.</italic></p><p>We expanded the description of our luminal domain antibody validation. First, it recognizes a band that co-migrates with the PAM band detected by the anti-CD antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>); 2) the intensity of this band is dramatically reduced in the PAM knockdown strains compared to empty vector controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), indicating that the detected band is indeed PAM; 3) the intensity of this band is greatly increased in the ∆-CD strain, which directly correlates with the increase in PAM enzymatic activity of this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>); 4) the luminal antibody shows the same immunofluorescence staining pattern in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> as does the CD antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We believe these data, which are already present in the manuscript, fully validate this antibody. We provide more information on the preparation and characterization of this antibody (subsection “PAM enzymatic activity is important for ciliogenesis”, second paragraph; subsection “Antibodies” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> legend)and include a map of the antigen and a gel showing its purity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
