as increased work. Muscle progenitors (MPs) control muscle repair due to severe damage, but the role of MP fusion and associated myonuclear accretion during exercise are unclear. While we previously demonstrated that MP fusion is required for growth using a supra-physiological model (Goh and Millay, 2017), questions remained about the need for myonuclear accrual during muscle adaptation in a physiological setting. Here, we developed an 8 week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol and assessed the importance of MP fusion. In 8 month-old mice, HIIT led to progressive myonuclear accretion throughout the protocol, and functional muscle hypertrophy. Abrogation of MP fusion at the onset of HIIT resulted in exercise intolerance and fibrosis. In contrast, ablation of MP fusion 4 weeks into HIIT, preserved exercise tolerance but attenuated hypertrophy. We conclude that myonuclear accretion is required for different facets of exercise-induced adaptive responses, impacting both muscle repair and hypertrophic growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myonuclear accretion</kwd><kwd>muscle hypertrophy</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>myomaker</kwd><kwd>cell fusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR068286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Millay</surname><given-names>Douglas P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Millay</surname><given-names>Douglas P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG059605</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Millay</surname><given-names>Douglas P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR060636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Se-Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL130356</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sadayappan</surname><given-names>Sakthivel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL105826</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sadayappan</surname><given-names>Sakthivel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR067279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sadayappan</surname><given-names>Sakthivel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1/R56HL139680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sadayappan</surname><given-names>Sakthivel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fusion of muscle progenitors drives continuous myonuclear accretion during exercise and impacts various adaptations in skeletal muscle including response to injury and hypertrophy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle is a unique tissue that comprises 40% of our total body mass and is essential for breathing, movement, and metabolism. In contrast to the majority of other cell types, a single skeletal muscle fiber, which is formed from the fusion of precursor cells during development, contains hundreds of nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2017</xref>). Muscle is a remarkably plastic tissue in the adult with the ability to regenerate due to the presence of <italic>bona fide</italic> muscle stem cells (MuSCs or also referred to as satellite cells), and also respond to various stimuli by altering its contractile and metabolic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egan and Zierath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoppeler, 2016</xref>). Proper regulation of skeletal muscle involves adaptations in the myofiber and an ability for MuSCs to activate and differentiate into muscle progenitors (MPs), which fuse to myofibers thereby increasing myonuclear number. While the role for MP fusion in response to major damage such as cardiotoxin-injury is well-recognized, its function during exercise-induced adaptations continues to be debated.</p><p>The adaptive response of skeletal muscle to exercise is diverse and includes an alteration in structure, metabolism, and function. The specific adaptation depends on the exercise stimulus, where resistance training induces an increase of myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) to deal with increased loads and endurance training elicits greater metabolic changes allowing muscle to become more fatigue resistant. There is consensus that MuSCs are indeed activated in humans after exercise, however whether MuSC activation and downstream myonuclear accretion is required for adaptive hypertrophy is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Snijders et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murach et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bamman et al., 2018</xref>). The requirement of myonuclear accretion for hypertrophy may depend on muscle fiber type as growth of 18% in slow, type I myofibers is associated with an increase of myonuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Snijders et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellamy et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, an increase in myonuclear content of fast, type II myofibers is only observed after 26–40% hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Snijders et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petrella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stec et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, while muscle adapts to exercise in various ways, the role of MP fusion and associated myonuclear accretion for hypertrophy is not clear.</p><p>While informative, the majority of human studies on the response of MuSCs to exercise are correlational in nature and biopsies reflect only a small portion of the entire muscle, therefore model organisms such as the mouse have also been utilized to shed light on MuSC-dependent exercise adaptations. Muscle overload by synergist ablation is the most often used stimulus to drive hypertrophy in the mouse, however it is an invasive procedure where a synergist muscle (e.g., gastrocnemius) is surgically removed leaving a smaller muscle (e.g., plantaris) to do all of the required work to ambulate the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirby et al., 2016a</xref>). While synergist ablation induces significant hypertrophy, there are questions about its physiological relevance due to its invasive nature and the potential to damage the muscle, and the magnitude of insult is far above anything experienced by muscle undergoing normal exercise. Recent work using models of MuSC ablation through diptheria toxin (DTA) has shown differing results as to whether they are required for hypertrophy in response to synergist ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCarthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCarthy et al., 2011</xref>). Current ideas include that MP fusion is required for synergist ablation at young ages (below 4 months of age) but not at older timepoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murach et al., 2017a</xref>). Through a complementary approach, we abrogated MP fusion by genetically deleting Myomaker (<italic>Mymk</italic>), a muscle-specific factor required for fusion, and found that synergist ablation-induced hypertrophy was significantly blunted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh and Millay, 2017</xref>). These results are consistent with Egner et al., that the presence of MuSCs are required for growth induced by synergist ablation, but questions still exist about whether there is an age dependence of MP fusion for hypertrophy and if they are required in a physiologically relevant system. While voluntary wheel running is a standard exercise stimulus for the mouse and ablation of MuSCs by DTA have minimal impact on adaptations to voluntary wheel running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murach et al., 2017b</xref>), this exercise stimulus does not lead to significant myofiber hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Lisio and Farup, 2017</xref>). A progressive weighted wheel running protocol was recently reported to increase myofiber size but it is not understood if this exercise regimen is associated with improved muscle function or if MP fusion is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dungan et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is not known if MP fusion is necessary for adaptive hypertrophy in a physiologically-relevant exercise protocol.</p><p>In addition to the lack of a physiological hypertrophy-inducing protocol for mice, another challenge in elucidating the role of MP-dependent myonuclear accretion during exercise-induced adaptations is that changes in muscle are dynamic. Indeed, initiation of an exercise regimen leads to mechanical damage of the muscle characterized by alterations of the cytoskeleton and structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damas et al., 2018</xref>). Because the classical stimulus activating MuSCs is muscle damage it is not surprising they are stimulated in this initial stage of exercise. It has thus been proposed that myonuclear accretion during exercise may occur as an early injury response and not specifically to drive hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murach et al., 2018a</xref>). Moreover, it is not understood if the increase in myonuclei resulting from accrual during the early response to exercise are sufficient for myofiber growth that occurs at later stages. Overall, a major obstacle in elucidating a causative relationship between MP fusion and myofiber growth has been the lack of a model that uncouples the addition of myonuclei for repair from accretion associated with hypertrophy.</p><p>We therefore sought to develop an exercise protocol that leads to muscle hypertrophy, thereby allowing interrogation of the requirement of MP fusion during the process. We utilized a high-intensity interval treadmill protocol (HIIT) that led to progressive myonuclear accretion, consistent hypertrophy of multiple muscles, and improved functional output. Through abrogation of MP fusion by deleting Myomaker in MPs, we demonstrate that myonuclear accrual is essential for normal adaptive remodeling in response to exercise. Most notably, our data indicate that accretion of myonuclei supports temporally distinct adaptive outcomes, which allows us, for the first time, to parse apart myonuclear accrual occurring in response to muscle damage and repair from growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A high-intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise protocol elicits an increase in muscle weight and strength</title><p>A hypertrophy-inducing exercise protocol for mice is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cholewa et al., 2014</xref>), although recently a high interval training protocol (HIIT) for aged mice was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seldeen et al., 2018</xref>). To determine the role of MP fusogenicity for physiological hypertrophy, we modified this protocol for non-aged adult mice. The aged HIIT protocol lasted 16 weeks and we hypothesized hypertrophy could be maximized in 8 weeks if the amount of work accomplished over 16 weeks could be condensed over 8 weeks. We designed an exercise regimen to increase the amount of work during each week of the protocol by training mice three times per week and either increasing the angle of incline or speed of the treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After 1 week of acclimation to the treadmill, 8-month-old wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to a treadmill speed of 15–16 meters/minute with an incline of 10°. Speed remained constant during the initial 4 weeks of the protocol, but incline was increased by 5° each week. For the final 4 weeks, incline was maintained at 25° but speed was progressively increased. Analysis of muscle weights revealed a significant increase of multiple muscle groups in HIIT-trained mice compared to sedentary mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next performed in vivo functional analysis to assess if HIIT resulted in an increase in muscle strength. The hindlimb plantar flexor muscles were stimulated at multiple frequencies and force was measured throughout each of these contractions, generating a force-frequency curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Peak isometric tetanic force of the hindlimb plantar flexor was increased after HIIT compared to sedentary mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The peak isometric tetanic force curve was then analyzed to calculate the rates by which the muscles contracted and relaxed. We observed an increase in rate of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) but no significant effect on rate of relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating that HIIT-trained muscle has the capability to generate peak tetanic force more quickly. Finally, calculation of impulse (area under the peak isometric tetanic force curve) revealed an increase after HIIT showing that those muscles can sustain higher force over a single contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Overall, HIIT leads to an increase in muscle size and strength suggesting that it could represent a novel protocol to investigate exercise-induced adaptations in the mouse.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44876.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High intensity interval training (HIIT) in mice increases muscle size and strength.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the HIIT protocol using a treadmill.

We stained nuclei of isolated myofibers from the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) from sedentary mice and mice subjected to 2, 4, and 8 weeks of HIIT. Qualitatively, we observed an increase of myonuclei at each stage of the protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Since initiation of an exercise regimen can lead to muscle damage that must be repaired to execute future bouts of exercise, and that Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup> mice displayed exercise intolerance 3 weeks into HIIT, we suspected that HIIT may elicit muscle damage that requires MP fusion. Although exercise-induced muscle damage is not well-characterized, especially in comparison to muscle damage as a result of genetic diseases such as muscular dystrophy, release of creatine kinase is a standard assay to measure damage-associated loss of cell membrane integrity. We therefore assessed if HIIT elicited membrane damage that results in release of creatine kinase into the serum. Levels of creatine kinase in the serum of Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup> mice were increased at 2 weeks and 4 weeks of HIIT compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Each of these contractile stress genes were upregulated during HIIT in Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, C and D</xref>). These data indicate that the initial stages of HIIT led to some level of mechanical stress of the muscle, which was subsequently attenuated as part of the normal adaptive response in control mice. Thus, the inability to resolve the initial mechanical stress could account for the exercise intolerance observed in Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup> mice. It should be noted that damage in Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup> HIIT mice was not major enough to elicit functional deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Analysis of myofiber size in the gastrocnemius and quadriceps of control mice subjected to HIIT displayed the expected 15–20% increase, however Myomaker<sup>scKO 4w</sup> muscle failed to hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>).

Taken together, HIIT-induced muscle growth requires MP fusion throughout the exercise protocol. While this indicates a tight relationship between myonuclear numbers and adaptive growth, it also raises the intriguing possibility that the mechanistic requirement for fusion at the later stages of HIIT is independent, and potentially distinct, from the need for accrual in the earlier stages that involve injury and repair.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44876.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Myonuclei added over the final 4 weeks of HIIT are required for HIIT-induced hypertrophy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing how Myomaker<sup>scKO 4w</sup> mice were generated.

Muscle growth driven by myostatin inhibition in the absence of MP fusion ability, further indicates that the reason underlying a lack of hypertrophy in HIIT-trained Myomaker<sup>scKO 4w</sup> muscle is due to deficient myonuclear accretion in the final stages of exercise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we evaluated the role of MP fusogenicity and associated myonuclear accretion during physiological exercise. Since the most often used exercise stimulus for mice, voluntary wheel running, does not lead to consistent hypertrophy we developed a HIIT protocol by exposing mice to a progressive increase in the amount of work performed through adjusting either the treadmill incline or speed over 8 weeks. We observed an increase in myonuclear numbers at each stage of HIIT indicating that MP fusion occurs throughout the exercise regimen. HIIT resulted in a 16% increase in myofiber CSA in the gastrocnemius and a 21% increase in the quadriceps, which developed between 4 and 8 weeks of the protocol. Ablation of MP fusion either at the onset of, or 4 weeks into, HIIT produces divergent observations with important ramifications. Absence of MP-derived Myomaker at the beginning of HIIT resulted in an inability to withstand the exercise stimulus, development of maladaptive remodeling, and lack of adaptive hypertrophy, whereas deletion of Myomaker 4 weeks into HIIT mainly impacted hypertrophy.</p><p>The requirement of MuSCs for myofiber hypertrophy has been debated for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Snijders et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murach et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cornelison, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Connor et al., 2007</xref>). Genetic perturbations of MuSCs and their MP descendants offer the most direct assessment of their role during muscle growth, but results have not led to a consensus paradigm. Ablation of MuSCs with a DTA allele in 4 month-old mice, which would inhibit the potential to generate fusogenic MPs, was initially reported to not impact the ability for myofibers to hypertrophy after synergist ablation, leading to the idea that MuSCs were dispensible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCarthy et al., 2011</xref>). This experiment was repeated by an independent group that antithetically found MuSC-ablated muscle was unable to hypertrophy in 3–4 month-old-mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egner et al., 2016</xref>). We also performed synergist ablation on fusion-incompetent mice (through deletion Myomaker in MPs) at 3–4 months of age and found an absolute requirement of MP fusogenicity for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh and Millay, 2017</xref>). Moreover, another study confirmed the requirement of MuSCs for overload-induced hypertrophy in 3 month old mice through genetic deletion of serum response factor (Srf), which is required for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Randrianarison-Huetz et al., 2018</xref>). Current ideas to explain the discrepancies are that young mice (younger than 4 months of age) are reliant on MP fusogenicity for growth but older myofibers can hypertrophy in the absence of new myonuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murach et al., 2017b</xref>). Recent evidence claims an age-dependence on MuSCs as ablation of MuSCs at 4 weeks of age reduces normal developmental hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bachman et al., 2018</xref>), while loss of MuSCs in the adult has minimal effects in sedentary mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keefe et al., 2015</xref>). We show here that ablation of MP fusion at the onset of HIIT in 8-month-old mice results in exercise intolerance and fibrosis. Since synergist ablation is a stronger stimulus compared to HIIT, we think it is unlikely that Myomaker<sup>scKO</sup> mice at 8 months of age would be able to properly adapt to synergist ablation. Overall, our data indicates that age dependence may not sufficiently explain the discrepancy about the role of MuSCs for synergist ablation-induced hypertrophy in mice that are 3–4 months of age.</p><p>Myonuclear accretion during HIIT is continuous where approximately 25 myonuclei per myofiber are added within the first 2 weeks, another 25–30 myonuclei between 2 and 4 weeks, and then 25 myonuclei over the final 4 weeks. While myonuclear number increases throughout HIIT, growth of myofibers occurred between 4 and 8 weeks indicating that myonuclear accretion precedes detectable growth. This is consistent with the response of muscle to synergist ablation where myofibers acquire new nuclei before an increase in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruusgaard et al., 2010</xref>). Our data not only demonstrate the persistent nature of myonuclear accrual during exercise, but we also shed light on whether myofibers require new nuclei throughout the protocol to grow. Ablation of Myomaker in MPs 4 weeks after HIIT resulted in a failure to hypertrophy even though this only corresponds to a lack of 25 myonuclei. These data show that the addition of 50–55 myonuclei added during the initial 4 weeks of HIIT are not sufficient to drive adaptive hypertrophy. Thus, a key finding from our work is that HIIT-induced adaptive growth requires continued myonuclear accrual throughout the protocol.</p><p>Exercise-induced adaptations involve the response to myofiber damage, increased contractile output, and growth of the myofiber, but it has been difficult to ascertain if myonuclear accrual is required for each of these adaptations. Surprisingly, the HIIT protocol described here may have uncoupled these adaptive processes since there are multiple lines of evidence suggesting distinct phases (mitigation of injury and growth) during HIIT. First, we show that muscle damage (assessed by levels of serum creatine kinase and contractile stress genes) is a normal response to HIIT and these damage markers progressively diminish over the duration of the protocol. If fusion is abrogated at the onset of HIIT (Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup>), mice are unable to repair HIIT-induced muscle damage, which causes exercise intolerance. However, when mice are allowed to accumulate new nuclei into the myofiber (approximately 50–55) during the first four weeks but further MP fusion is blocked (Myomaker<sup>scKO 4w</sup>), the mice are able to exercise normally indicating that the damage phase of exercise has been mitigated. These data are generally consistent with reports in humans that resistance training causes early increases in protein synthesis to support tissue repair but does not correlate with hypertrophy, which occurs only after the repair of damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Damas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitchell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>What could explain the observation that Myomaker<sup>scKO 4w</sup> mice are able to exercise normally during the final four weeks of HIIT? One possibility is that the nature of the stimulus changed from a gradual increase in treadmill incline in the first four weeks to an increase in speed (with constant incline) over the next four weeks. One argument against this possibility is that Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup> mice exhibit progressive failure to exercise even after the protocol changed. A limitation of our study is that we did not test if Myomaker<sup>scKO 4w</sup> mice eventually become exercise intolerant by extending the exercise protocol or performing an acute treadmill run-to-exhaustion test. Another possibility that could explain the ability for Myomaker<sup>scKO 4w</sup> mice to exercise is that nuclei added during the first four weeks of HIIT still support the reparative response in the final four weeks of HIIT, which allows them to tolerate the exercise.</p><p>Since Myomaker<sup>scKO 4w</sup> mice exercise normally during the final four weeks of HIIT and have accumulated 50–55 new nuclei/fiber, why do they not undergo muscle hypertrophy? This question is currently difficult to answer but dogma would argue that Myomaker<sup>scKO 4w</sup> muscle has not accumulated enough myonuclei to grow. Perhaps there is a tight correlation between absolute myonuclear numbers and growth potential, with minimal tolerance for reduced numbers. A more provocative explanation is that the added myonuclei may be assigned specialized roles depending on the stage of adaptation. In this scenario, the 25 new myonuclei added in the final 4 weeks of HIIT are specialized for growth whereas the 50–55 myonuclei added in the first 4 weeks of HIIT are mainly utilized for repair of tissue injury. Adding support to such an idea of specialized roles of accrued myonuclei is that our data also reveal a potential lack of redundancy within the population of the newly accrued nuclei, given the apparent inability of the 50–55 nuclei added early in HIIT to compensate for the lack of 25 nuclei late in HIIT to drive growth. The two ideas discussed here, that there is a threshold of myonuclear number that must be met for growth and the potential for myonuclear functional heterogeneity, are not necessarily inconsistent with each other. More specifically, it is possible that there is a tight correlation of myonuclear number for growth because new nuclei specialized for growth are required, thereby increasing overall myonuclear numbers. Precise mechanisms by which myofibers utilize the new nuclei during various stages of adaptation warrants further investigation.</p><p>The importance of myonuclear accretion has classically been viewed through the lens of the myonuclear domain theory, which postulates that a given myonucleus controls a certain volume of cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murach et al., 2018b</xref>), and that for muscle to grow it needs more nuclei to support the larger cellular volume. We propose that the myonuclear domain theory may be too simplistic to explain the complexity of muscle adaptability. A major issue with the myonuclear domain theory is that it links myonuclear numbers solely with growth. In doing so, it assumes all myonuclei, freshly accrued or added during development, are homogenous in terms of both magnitude and profile of transcriptional activity. However, myonuclei possess the ability to alter transcription in the absence of MuSCs suggesting a dynamic, heterogenous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirby et al., 2016b</xref>). Our data reveals that myonuclear accrual extends beyond just the maintenance of the myonuclear domain. Indeed, MP fusion and myonuclear accrual are essential for normal exercise-related adaptive responses that encompass both repair and growth, which has implications for maintaining muscle mass during disease and aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source <break/>or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (M. musculus)</td><td><italic>Mymk</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Millay et al., 2014</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh and Millay, 2017</xref></td><td/><td>Dr. Douglas Millay (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center)</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (M. musculus)</td><td><italic>Pax7</italic><sup>CreER</sup></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lepper et al., 2009</xref></td><td/><td>Dr. Chen-Ming Fan (Carnegie Science)</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>ACVR2B-Fc</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2012</xref></td><td/><td>Dr. Se-Jin Lee (The Jackson Laboratory)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Mymk</italic> mouse strains used in this study have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh and Millay, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Millay et al., 2014</xref>).

Prior to initiation of 8 weeks of HIIT, 8 month old mice were administered five daily doses of TAM at 0.075 mg/g/day through intraperitoneal injections (Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup>). In a second group of 8 month old mice, TAM treatment was delayed, and the five daily doses were administered after the 4<sup>th</sup> week of HIIT (Myomaker<sup>scKO 4w</sup>). After initial TAM dosing, all mice received a weekly TAM injection for the remaining duration of the HIIT protocol. For the ACVR2B-Fc study, 3 month old mice were subjected to five daily doses of TAM 3 days prior to administration of ACVR2B-Fc, and maintained on a TAM regimen (injections every three days) for 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>High-intensity interval training (HIIT)</title><p>We modified a recently reported high-intensity interval training protocol (HIIT) for aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seldeen et al., 2018</xref>). Our 8 week HIIT protocol was designed to increase the amount of work performed each week. For the first 4 weeks of HIIT, there was a weekly 5<sup>o</sup> increase in the angle of inclination from 10° at week 1 up to 25° at week 4. Treadmill speed was maintained at 15 m/min for this duration. From weeks 5–8, treadmill speed was increased by 1 m/min weekly to a maximum speed of 20 m/min at week 8, while the angle of inclination was maintained at 25°. Using the equation developed previously (Work (J) = body mass (kg) x gravity (9.81 m/sec<sup>2</sup>) x vertical speed (m/sec x angle) x time (sec)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nie et al., 2016</xref>) to determine the amount of work performed (J), we established that our HIIT protocol results in a weekly increase of 5–15% in work.</p><p>Prior to HIIT, mice were acclimated on the treadmill three times a week at a speed of 8 m/min for 15 min with no incline. After a week of acclimation, mice were subjected to 3 sessions of HIIT per week for 8 weeks. Each session consisted of a 5 min warm-up at 8 m/min, eight exercise intervals at the prescribed speed and angle of inclination for 3–5 min, and a 1 min rest interval at 8 m/min between each exercise interval. As a negative reinforcement, mice that were unable to stay on the treadmill were shocked by an electric stimulus emanating from a shock grid located at the back of the treadmill. The electric stimulus was set at a current of 1 mA and a repetition rate of 2 Hz. At the last HIIT session of each week, exercise tolerance in each mouse was assessed by counting the number of times the mouse landed on the shock grid. Each mouse was visually observed for at least 5 min for this purpose. To ensure mice could meet the demands of the protocol, we established an exclusion-criteria based on the inability of the mouse to recover following electric shock exposure. Mice were given 5 s to resume running after landing on the shock grid; those that remained on the shock grid for more than 5 s were manually assisted back on the treadmill. If such assistance occurs more than twice during an exercise interval, the mouse is excluded from treadmill running for the duration of that interval. An exclusion from two exercise intervals in the same HIIT session would result in the mouse being excluded from the remainder of the session. Finally, an exclusion from more than 2 HIIT sessions resulted in expulsion from the study and no data from these mice were used for analysis. Based on this exclusion criteria, we had to remove 1 Control mouse, 3 Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup>, and 0 Myomaker<sup>scKO 4w</sup> mice. All HIIT sessions were performed on an Exer 3/6 Treadmill from Columbus Instruments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Inhibition of myostatin signaling</title><p>Inhibition of myostatin/activin A signaling, a potent negative regulator of muscle mass, was achieved by a pharmacological approach previously described by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, robust muscle hypertrophy was induced by utilizing a soluble form of the activin type IIB receptor where the extracellular ligand binding domain has been fused to an Fc domain (ACVR2B-Fc), effectively rendering it as a decoy receptor for myostatin. 3 month old mice were given four weekly doses of PBS or ACVR2B-Fc at 10 mg/kg through intraperitoneal injections 3 days after the last dose of TAM was administered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vivo muscle force measurements</title><p>Following 8 weeks of HIIT, the strength of plantar flexor muscles was evaluated by in vivo isometric tetanic force measurements. Mice were placed under anesthesia with 2% isoflurane inhalation, then the right knee was fixed on a clamp, and the right foot secured at a 90° angle on the pedal of a dual-mode servometer (300C-LR: Aurora Scientific, Aurora, ON, Canada). To stimulate the tibia nerve, needle electrodes connected to an electric stimulator (701C: Aurora Scientific, Aurora, ON, Canada) were inserted in the posterior knee. Isometric twitch force (Pt) was generated by a 0.2 ms pulse with 50 mA to find the optimal muscle length. Maximum isometric tetanic force (Po) of the plantar flexor muscles was subsequently evaluated by a 0.2 ms pulse for 350 ms at a frequency of 50 to 150 Hz. A two-minute rest was allowed between each tetanic contraction. All force measurement data was collected by Dynamic Muscle Control (DMC v5.5) and analyzed based on the tetanic force graph by Dynamic Muscle Analysis (DMA v5.3), which yielded peak tetanic force, rate of force activation and relaxation, and impulse achieved during a tetanic contraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Muscle collection and preparation</title><p>Quadriceps, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior (TA), and extensor digitorum longus muscles (EDL) were dissected, blotted dry, and weighed. Hindlimbs were dissolved overnight in lysis buffer containing 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma Aldrich #03115879001) at 55°C. Tibia length was assessed by a digital caliper, and the average of three measurements was recorded. For histological sections, muscles were embedded in OCT compound (gastrocnemius and quadriceps) or 1% tragacanth/PBS (TA) and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled 2-methylbutane for cryosections, or embedded in warm paraffin wax (gastrocnemius) for paraffin sections that were stained with Masson’s Trichrome. Sections were then cut at 10 µm. For gene expression analysis, quadriceps were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C. For single fiber analysis, whole EDL muscles were incubated in 0.2% Type I collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich #C-0130) in DMEM (Hyclone) for 1 hr at 37°C, and then transferred to DMEM containing 10% horse serum and triturated to release individual fibers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histological analyses and serum creatine kinase</title><p>Cryosections were fixed in 1% PFA/PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS, blocked with 1% BSA/PBS/1% heat-inactivated goat serum/0.025% Tween20/PBS, and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Following 1 hr of incubation with a secondary Alexa Fluor antibody (1:200) (Invitrogen), slides were mounted with VectaShield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). For assessment of hypertrophy, samples were stained with anti-laminin (1:100; Sigma-Aldrich # L9393), and myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) was visualized and quantified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh and Millay, 2017</xref>). To assay for myonuclear number, samples were stained with anti-dystrophin (1:100; Abcam #ab15277), and visualized at 40x on a Nikon A1R + LUNV on a Ti-E Inverted Microscope. The total number of DAPI<sup>+</sup> nuclei within a dystrophin-stained myofiber was quantified. Myonuclear accretion was also assessed in single EDL myofibers. Isolated fibers were fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 30 min at 4°C, washed three times in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI. 10x optical sections were generated on a Nikon Ti-E SpectraX widefield microscope, and the total number of DAPI<sup>+</sup> nuclei along the entire length of a myofiber was quantified with a spot detection algorithm developed in Imaris (Bitplane). To quantify the size of a single fiber, length and radius measurements were performed in Imaris, and muscle volume was calculated. For assessment of fibrosis, Masson’s Trichrome staining was performed on paraffin sections using standard protocols. Fibrotic area within a section was visualized at 20x with an Olympus BX51 inverted microscope, and quantified with a binary thresholding algorithm from Imaris (Bitplane). Blood was harvested from the inferior vena cava of anesthetized mice, then submitted to the clinical laboratory at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center for analysis of creatine kinase in the serum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from quadriceps muscle with Trizol (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase with random hexamer primers (Applied Biosystems).

For data sets with two independent variables, a 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was performed. Statistical significance was set at a P value &lt; 0.05. For assessments of size (myofiber CSA and single fiber muscle volume), total nuclei (cross-sections and single fibers), and fibrosis, data analyses were performed in a blinded fashion. All data sets are presented as means ± SD, and the degree of significance between data sets is depicted as follows: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Confocal Imaging Core at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital for assistance with Imaris-based algorithms, and Vikram Prasad of the Molkentin Laboratory for helpful discussions and experimental advice.

More specifically, if fusion of activated satellite cells (MP) are mandatory for hypertrophy. There have been two major caveats in this debate, one is that most of the conclusions are based on supra-physiological overload by surgical ablation of synergists. The other is a current perception that only in animals less than 4 months of age muscle hypertrophy is dependent on MP fusion. The current paper resolves both these questions: animals of 8 months of age subjected to a physiological high intensity training protocol displayed significant hypertrophy, while when MP fusion was prevented, hypertrophy was also prevented. In my opinion these are the most interesting findings, but the paper also demonstrated that when MP fusion was prevented at the onset of exercise the animals were unable to fulfil the exercise task and muscle fibrosis was also induced. If the fusion was prevented only after the initial exercise phase these phenomena did not occur, but hypertrophy was still largely prevented.</p><p>A particular strength, is that the authors has dealt elegantly with the problem of the transgenic animals not performing well on the exercise task and that they displayed fibrosis.</p><p>The major weakness of the study is that the number of observations is low (down to 3), and some of the results therefore need to be interpreted with caution. The statistics should be improved or at least be described better.

If the authors still have extracts of muscles, they should be able to measure more relevant molecules such as heat-shock proteins or embryonal myosin (the latter can also be analysed on cryosections). It would also be useful if they could compare such markers between control and experimental groups, e.g. is the level higher in the mice that were tamoxifen injected at the onset than for other groups (controls and late injected.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>As mentioned, I find large parts of the Discussion problematic, for example:</p><p>&quot;Exercise-induced adaptations involve the response to myofiber damage, increased contractile output, and growth of the myofiber, but it has been difficult to ascertain if myonuclear accrual is required for early exercise-related injury alone, adaptive growth alone, or both.&quot;</p><p>I have never seen anybody suggest that myonuclear accrual should not be related to repair of injury. Very unclear statement, rephrase.</p><p>&quot;Surprisingly, the HIIT protocol described here uncoupled these adaptive processes.&quot;</p><p>I am not sure the data really show this. You would need to explain better or delete.</p><p>&quot;We observed an increase in myonuclear numbers at each stage of HIIT indicating that MP fusion occurs and that accrual is not a consequence of a single event.&quot;</p><p>I am not sure I understand this. What single event? Do you mean onset of exercise? I would interpret the data to mean that there is a gradual increase in the number of nuclei with a somewhat lagging increase in CSA during exercise. Bruusgaard et al., 2010 showed by overload that the MP fusion seemed to precede the CSA growth, and thus hinting on a causal relationship. When the authors here state &quot;It is interesting to consider that in WT mice myonuclear accretion occurs throughout HIIT but hypertrophy transpires at later stages.&quot; It sounds like a similar conclusion. Could the authors plot the data in a better way illustrating this point?</p><p>&quot;This suggests that an increase in myonuclei does not necessarily indicate that hypertrophy is forthcoming, which could explain the inconsistencies of studies reporting a correlation between myonuclear number and myofiber size and other studies finding no correlation (Murach et al., 2018; Damas et al., 2018).&quot;</p><p>I don't understand this argument. I have not seen anybody suggest that an increase in myonuclei is in itself is sufficient to induce hypertrophy. As I understand it the general idea has been that more myonuclei might be required for hypertrophy, but that some hypertrophic signal (for example load) is also required. For example, inactive nulei-rich fibres will also atrophy if denervated. I also don't understand how the findings of Murach et al., 2018 (is a review not a study) and Damas et al., 2018, could be explained in this way?</p><p>&quot;Since our data indicate that evidence of myonuclear accretion cannot be used simply to predict myofiber size, we propose that addition of myonuclei may serve specialized roles depending on the stage of adaptation. For instance, myonuclei could be recruited to the myofiber during exercise initiation to allow adaptation to moderate damage whereas myonuclear accretion at the later stages of HIIT could facilitate adaptive hypertrophy. Collectively, these observations agree with reports in humans that resistance training-induced hypertrophy occurs after suppression of damage (Damas et al., 2016)&quot;.</p><p>My interpretation would be that muscle fibres without new nuclei don't increase sufficiently in size and/or strength to cope with the forced HIIT and some of the fibres are ruptured. Muscle damage in untrained people that start to exercise abruptly and hard is well known (rhabdomyolysis), and here electroshock is used. I don't think this translates to specialized roles for nuclei depending on stage of adaption or that early accretion is necessarily related to damage. Has damage been observed in the control mice here? The title of Damas et al., 2016, rephrased here is misleading. As I understand it, the authors of that paper did not really suppress damage, they just compared synthesis during early phases with lots of repair and later phases with less repair and more radial growth. If this part is to be kept in the Discussion the relevance to the present paper needs to be explained better.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Muscle stem cells, known as satellite cells, are well known to be required for regeneration after acute muscle damage. However, the role of satellite cells during muscle hypertrophy has been controversial. Most studies using mouse to examine the contribution of satellite cells during hypertrophy have genetically ablated satellite cells, using Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup>/+;RosaDTA/+ mice, in the context of synergistic ablation. However, synergistic ablation may not be physiologically relevant to exercise-induced hypertrophy and satellite cell ablation may have unknown consequences on the molecular and cellular characteristics of the myofiber (for instance, if the myofiber somehow can &quot;sense&quot; the presence of satellite cells and so the absence of satellite cells may change the myofiber characteristics). This manuscript from the Millay lab takes a new approach toward interrogating the role of satellite cells in muscle hypertrophy. First, they develop a new system to induce muscle hypertrophy in mice: 8 month old mice are subject to running 3x/week (at 15-16 meters/minute) on a treadmill in which the incline angle progressively increases (10o, 15o, 20 o, and 25 o) during the first 4 weeks and then the treadmill speed increases progressively (17, 18, 19, and 20 m/min) during the final 4 weeks. Second, in experimental mice they specifically prevent fusion of satellite cells to the myofibers using the tightly controlled Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup>/+;<italic>Mymk</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup>, in which Myomaker (required for fusion) is deleted inducibly in satellite cells. Using these two techniques. they gain unique insights into the role of satellite cells in hypertrophy. First, they find that their High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) protocol does indeed lead to myofiber hypertrophy during 4-8 weeks of HIIT (as measured by an increase in myofiber cross-sectional area of 4 different leg muscles) with increased muscle strength and this is accompanied by an increase in myonuclei/myofiber (as measured in EDL and Quadriceps muscles). Second, deletion of Myomaker in satellite cells did indeed abrogate myonuclear accretion, and loss of myomaker and myonuclear accretion throughout the 8 week HIIT inhibited the mice's ability to perform and adapt to exercise stimulus (beginning at 3 weeks of HIIT). Third, based on measurements of Ankrd1/2 and Crsp3 the HIIT protocol resulted in transitory myofiber damage at 2 weeks of HIIT. Fourth, inhibition of satellite cell fusion for the entire 8 weeks of HIIT resulted in an increase in fibrosis. However, inhibition of satellite cell fusion beginning at 4 weeks of HIIT did not result in fibrosis or impair the ability of mice to exercise, but led to myofiber failure to hypertrophy. Fifth, even in the absence of satellite cell fusion to myofibers, myofibers are able to hypertrophy in response to myostatin inhibitors. Together these data suggest the following model. Satellite cells contribute to myofibers throughout the HIIT protocol, but only after 4 weeks of HIIT do myofibers hypertrophy. Based on the comparison of inhibition of satellite cell fusion throughout the 8 weeks of HIIT versus 4-8 weeks of HIIT, they conclude that satellite cell fusion during the first 4 weeks is necessary to prevent fibrosis and to ensure adaptation to exercise stimulus, while satellite cell fusion after 4 weeks enables myofiber hypertrophy. Thus they argue that the initial phase of satellite cell recruitment is to necessary to tolerate exercise stimulus, mitigate stress during the initial stages of HIIT, and prevent fibrosis, while the later phase of satellite cell recruitment is necessary for myofiber hypertrophy. Overall, this is a well-executed study that is clearly documented and explained and contributes to our knowledge of how satellite cells contribute to muscle hypertrophy.</p><p>1) I have only one substantive comment about the paper. The authors argue that the satellite cell contribution to myofibers during the first 4 weeks of HIIT serves a fundamentally different function than satellite cell contribution to myofibers during 4-8 weeks of HIIT. However, during the first 4 weeks of HIIT the mice were subjected to an increasing incline, while during the last 4 weeks the mice were subjected to increasing speed. Isn't the most parsimonious explanation of the difference in the function of satellite cell contribution during the first versus the second four weeks simply that these are different responses to increasing incline versus increasing speed? Would they see a difference if they simply increased monotonically either the incline or the speed throughout the 8 week HIIT? I do not propose that they re-do these experiments, but I think how to interpret the effects of inhibiting satellite cell fusion throughout the 8 weeks versus just the last 4 weeks of HIIT is unclear. At a minimum, the authors need to explicitly discuss this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44876.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript from Goh et al. directly addresses a fundamental controversy on how muscle mass is built.

A multiple comparison test was used for each type of ANOVA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>The authors discuss muscle damage a lot, but the molecular data they provide (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) is not really on molecules related to damage or repair/regeneration but rather to mechanical stress which might not always damage. If the authors still have extracts of muscles, they should be able to measure more relevant molecules such as heat-shock proteins or embryonal myosin (the latter can also be analysed on cryosections). It would also be useful if they could compare such markers between control and experimental groups, e.g. is the level higher in the mice that were tamoxifen injected at the onset than for other groups (controls and late injected.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed creatine kinase in the serum as a proxy for muscle damage. We did this in WT and Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup> mice at multiple time points after HIIT, and included the Results in the revised manuscript. We also now compare levels of mechanical stress genes between WT and Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup> mice. These data together show that HIIT-induced damage is increased in muscle that is fusion-incompetent (Myomaker<sup>scKO 8w</sup> mice).</p><p>We did not observe evidence for embryonal myosin+ myofibers on cryosections. As another proxy for muscle damage/repair, we analyzed central nuclei in the myofibers after HIIT. Similar to the Myh3 analysis, the levels of central nuclei are low in the quadriceps (3-5% after 2 weeks of HIIT). The difficulty for detection of central nuclei or Myh3 in sections could be because they may occur in discrete regions of the muscle, and therefore missed by analyzing a section at the mid-belly of the muscle. In this instance, creatine kinase is likely a better readout for muscle damage because the levels are contributed from all muscles. Another reason to explain the low or absent levels of Myh3 and central nuclei is that there is some debate if those characteristics are associated with all types of muscle damage. This controversy was mentioned by reviewer #2. Since this issue is still being debated in the field, we prefer not to show the Myh3 or central nuclei data because we think the analysis needs to be deeper before making a concrete statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>As mentioned, I find large parts of the Discussion problematic, for example:</p><p>&quot;Exercise-induced adaptations involve the response to myofiber damage, increased contractile output, and growth of the myofiber, but it has been difficult to ascertain if myonuclear accrual is required for early exercise-related injury alone, adaptive growth alone, or both.&quot;</p><p>I have never seen anybody suggest that myonuclear accrual should not be related to repair of injury.

What single event? Do you mean onset of exercise? I would interpret the data to mean that there is a gradual increase in the number of nuclei with a somewhat lagging increase in CSA during exercise. Bruusgaard et al., 2010 showed by overload that the MP fusion seemed to precede the CSA growth, and thus hinting on a causal relationship. When the authors here state &quot;It is interesting to consider that in WT mice myonuclear accretion occurs throughout HIIT but hypertrophy transpires at later stages.&quot; It sounds like a similar conclusion. Could the authors plot the data in a better way illustrating this point?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data are consistent with Bruusgaard et al., 2010, and included this in the Discussion. One key advance in our study is that we not only show that increases in myonuclear numbers precedes hypertrophy, but also demonstrate that significant adaptive hypertrophy requires continued MP fusion and myonuclear accrual.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;This suggests that an increase in myonuclei does not necessarily indicate that hypertrophy is forthcoming, which could explain the inconsistencies of studies reporting a correlation between myonuclear number and myofiber size and other studies finding no correlation (Murach et al., 2018; Damas et al., 2018).&quot;</p><p>I don't understand this argument. I have not seen anybody suggest that an increase in myonuclei is in itself is sufficient to induce hypertrophy. As I understand it the general idea has been that more myonuclei might be required for hypertrophy, but that some hypertrophic signal (for example load) is also required. For example, inactive nuclei-rich fibres will also atrophy if denervated. I also don't understand how the findings of Murach et al., 2018 (is a review not a study) and Damas et al., 2018, could be explained in this way?</p></disp-quote><p>We removed this statement in the overhauled Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Since our data indicate that evidence of myonuclear accretion cannot be used simply to predict myofiber size, we propose that addition of myonuclei may serve specialized roles depending on the stage of adaptation. For instance, myonuclei could be recruited to the myofiber during exercise initiation to allow adaptation to moderate damage whereas myonuclear accretion at the later stages of HIIT could facilitate adaptive hypertrophy. Collectively, these observations agree with reports in humans that resistance training-induced hypertrophy occurs after suppression of damage (Damas et al., 2016)&quot;.</p><p>My interpretation would be that muscle fibres without new nuclei don't increase sufficiently in size and/or strength to cope with the forced HIIT and some of the fibres are ruptured. Muscle damage in untrained people that start to exercise abruptly and hard is well known (rhabdomyolysis), and here electroshock is used. I don't think this translates to specialized roles for nuclei depending on stage of adaption or that early accretion is necessarily related to damage. Has damage been observed in the control mice here? The title of Damas et al., 2016, rephrased here is misleading. As I understand it, the authors of that paper did not really suppress damage, they just compared synthesis during early phases with lots of repair and later phases with less repair and more radial growth. If this part is to be kept in the Discussion the relevance to the present paper needs to be explained better.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show damage in control HIIT-trained mice and have better explained our idea about myonuclear specialization while also discussing other possibilities. Specifically to the issue of damage, the creatine kinase data shows that injury begins early in HIIT and definitely precedes any increase in size, therefore we do not think that injury is solely a consequence of an inability to increase in size. It is possible the early increases in myonuclei lead to an increase in strength that help the muscle deal with HIIT, but strength was not measured early in the protocol, and we acknowledge that is a limitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) I have only one substantive comment about the paper. The authors argue that the satellite cell contribution to myofibers during the first 4 weeks of HIIT serves a fundamentally different function than satellite cell contribution to myofibers during 4-8 weeks of HIIT. However, during the first 4 weeks of HIIT the mice were subjected to an increasing incline, while during the last 4 weeks the mice were subjected to increasing speed. Isn't the most parsimonious explanation of the difference in the function of satellite cell contribution during the first versus the second four weeks simply that these are different responses to increasing incline versus increasing speed? Would they see a difference if they simply increased monotonically either the incline or the speed throughout the 8 week HIIT? I do not propose that they re-do these experiments, but I think how to interpret the effects of inhibiting satellite cell fusion throughout the 8 weeks versus just the last 4 weeks of HIIT is unclear. At a minimum, the authors need to explicitly discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this alternative interpretation should be considered and included it in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
