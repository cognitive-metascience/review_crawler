Here, we present a complete sequence assembly of the germline genome and analyze multiple features of its structure and its relationship to the somatic genome, shedding light on the mechanisms of genome rearrangement as well as the evolutionary history of this remarkable germline/soma differentiation. Our results strengthen the notion that a complex, dynamic, and ongoing interplay between mobile DNA elements and the host genome have shaped <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> chromosome structure, locally and globally. Non-standard outcomes of rearrangement events, including the generation of short-lived somatic chromosomes and excision of DNA interrupting protein-coding regions, may represent novel forms of developmental gene regulation.

Some cases mediate the generation of protein products specific to a differentiated cell type, such as sigmaK of the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Kunkel et al., 1990</xref>) or the vast diversity of vertebrate immunoglobulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Schatz, 2004</xref>). Other cases result in genome-wide chromosome restructuring, as was first recognized by microscopic observation of parasitic nematodes over 125 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Boveri, 1887</xref>) and since documented in several eukaryotic branches, including vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bachmann-Waldmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wang and Davis, 2014</xref>). This large-scale phenomenon has been most thoroughly studied in the phylum Ciliophora, or ciliates, a deep-branching and diverse group of protozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bracht et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Chalker and Yao, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Coyne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Vogt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). Although unicellular, ciliates carry two distinct nuclei that display a remarkable form of germline/soma differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Orias et al., 2011</xref>); the smaller, diploid, transcriptionally silent germline nucleus (micronucleus or MIC) contains the genetic material transmitted across sexual generations, whereas the larger, polyploid, actively expressed somatic nucleus (macronucleus or MAC) supports all the vegetative functions of the cell. Despite differing in several fundamental features of eukaryotic nuclei, the MAC is derived from a mitotic sibling of the MIC during sexual reproduction in a process that involves extensive, genome-wide programmed DNA rearrangements.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19090.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nuclear dualism and genome rearrangement in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of two stages of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> life cycle showing major characteristics of micronuclei (MIC; red) and macronuclei (MAC; blue) and nuclear events of conjugation.

Cross-sequence alignment is represented by vertical dotted lines. Inter-scaffold assembly gaps are indicated by letters a, b, and c, for gaps in the MIC, MAC and both assemblies, respectively. The ends of MAC chromosome scaffolds terminating in telomere repeats are indicated by the letter d. When the ends of two MIC scaffolds align to adjacent regions of the same MAC scaffold (letter a), we may infer that these ends are adjacent in the MIC genome (unlike certain ciliates with highly 'scrambled' MIC genomes, <italic>T. thermophila</italic>'s MAC chromosomes are nearly always colinear with their MIC counterparts). The same principle applies to joining MAC scaffolds and chromosomes (letters b and d). This process could partially be carried out computationally, but human judgments (performed independently in two labs) were necessary in many cases to resolve alternative joining paths resulting from repetitive sequences or apparent MIC genome mis-assemblies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>). Unfortunately, both assemblies often 'break' in the same region (letter c), leaving no 'bridge' to the next scaffold in either. This occurred most often in regions abundant in smaller scaffolds, which we later found tend to be located near the middle of MIC chromosomes. Combining tiling and other data, as described in the main text, we constructed ‘best approximation’ MIC chromosome super-assemblies that incorporate 97% of the MIC genome assembly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19090.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19090.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19090-fig1-figsupp1-v2"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>The extent and nature of ciliate genome rearrangement vary widely within the phylum, but the two main events are chromosome fragmentation and DNA elimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the widely studied model organism, <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, the five MIC chromosomes are fragmented at sites of the 15 bp Chromosome breakage sequence (Cbs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Yao et al., 1990</xref>) into about 200 MAC chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Eisen et al., 2006</xref>). Other characterized ciliates also undergo extensive chromosome fragmentation but do not display a conserved cis-acting breakage signal. It has been suggested that the evolutionary advantage of chromosome fragmentation may relate to the high ploidy of MACs (~45N for all but one chromosome in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, ~800 N in <italic>Paramecium</italic>, ~2000 N in <italic>Oxytricha</italic>) and their amitotic division mechanism, which could damage larger chromosomes or be physically constrained by their entanglement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Coyne et al., 1996</xref>). This amitotic mechanism also results in unequal chromosome segregation, which can lead to the generation of phenotypic diversity among the vegetative descendants of a single cell ('phenotypic assortment', documented in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Orias and Flacks, 1975</xref>). In addition, fragmentation permits differential copy number control (observed in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Yao et al.

The more distantly related spirotrichous ciliate, <italic>Oxytricha trifallax</italic> undergoes an extreme type of genome rearrangement. Roughly 16,000 MAC chromosomes (most carrying only a single gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Swart et al., 2013</xref>) are derived from a MIC genome ten times the size of the MAC genome, in a process that also involves extensive 'unscrambling' of non-contiguous MIC genome sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A leitmotif of programmed genome rearrangements in many organisms is the involvement of mobile DNA elements. In some cases, this involvement is as an agent of the event, through domesticated gene products (e.g. Rag recombinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Fugmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Jones and Gellert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Kapitonov and Koonin, 2015</xref>], HO endonuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Koufopanou and Burt, 2005</xref>]); in other cases, mobile elements are a target of programmed rearrangement events (e.g. the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Skin element that interrupts the sigK gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Takemaru et al., 1995</xref>]). It has long been recognized that many ciliate IESs contain transposable elements (TEs) and/or their remnants and hypothesized that their elimination is a form of MAC genome self-defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Klobutcher and Herrick, 1997</xref>). In both <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> and <italic>Paramecium</italic>, IES elimination requires the action of proteins domesticated from piggyBac transposases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Baudry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Shieh and Chalker, 2013</xref>), as well as proteins and histone modifications associated with epigenetic TE silencing in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chalker et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Oxytricha</italic>, germline-limited transposons mediate their own excision and also contribute to other programmed rearrangement events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Nowacki et al., 2009</xref>). The evolutionary origins of chromosome fragmentation are less clear, but, at least in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, features of Cbs suggest a possible link to mobile elements ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashlock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Fan and Yao, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hamilton et al., 2006b</xref>] and this study). Thus, the study of programmed DNA rearrangement in ciliates may help shed light on the delicate evolutionary balance that exists between mobile elements and the genomes they occupy.</p><p>Despite germline sequencing efforts in three model ciliates, <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fass et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnaiz et al., 2012</xref>), and <italic>Oxytricha</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), there is no complete picture of the architectural relationship between ciliate germline and somatic genomes. Here, we report the sequencing, assembly, and analysis of the 157 Mb MIC genome of <italic>T. thermophila</italic> strain SB210, the same strain whose 103 Mb MAC genome sequence we have previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Coyne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Eisen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hamilton et al., 2006a</xref>). We constructed full-length super-assemblies of all five MIC chromosomes, providing a unique resource for ciliate genome analysis. By mapping a set of germline deletions against these super-assemblies, we delimited the locations of the five MIC centromeres. We mapped 225 instances of the Cbs, which define the ends of all 181 stably maintained MAC chromosomes as well as several short-lived, ‘Non-Maintained Chromosomes’ (NMCs), some of which contain a number of active genes. Additionally, we report multiple cases of short and long-range Cbs duplications in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> and the conservation of Cbs sequence and location in three other <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species. We showed that approximately one third (54 Mb) of the MIC genome is eliminated in the form of around 12,000 IESs, and mapped the precise locations of over 7500, revealing their enrichment at the centers and ends of MIC chromosomes. Our comparative analysis of MIC-limited TEs shows that the majority are related to DNA (Class 2) transposons from a variety of families and suggests multiple invasions of the genome and potentially recent transpositional activity. We analyzed IES junctions and excision variability genome-wide, greatly extending previous reports of their imprecision (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Austerberry et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Li and Pearlman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Wells et al., 1994</xref>]), and yet we also report a very limited number of unusual, precisely excised IESs that interrupt protein-coding regions. Our results provide the first genome-wide picture of programmed DNA rearrangements in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, and support a view of the germline genome as a complex and dynamic entity, on both developmental and evolutionary timescales.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Germline chromosome structure</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>MIC genome sequencing and chromosome-length assembly</title><p>Shotgun sequencing and assembly of the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> MIC genome is described in 'Materials and methods', and statistics are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>. The final assembly is 157 Mb in length and composed of 1464 scaffolds, whereas the MAC genome assembly is 103 Mb and contains 1158 scaffolds. To fully understand the inter-relationship of the MAC and MIC genomes, it is essential to join the scaffolds of each separate assembly into complete MAC and MIC chromosomes. Extensive genome closure and HAPPY mapping efforts have produced super-assemblies of every MAC chromosome ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Coyne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hamilton et al., 2006a</xref>]; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>) but considerable uncertainty remains as to scaffold placement and/or orientation on several chromosomes. Likewise, although genetic mapping can assign some MAC chromosomes/scaffolds to locations on one of the five MIC chromosomes, their order and orientation can be hard to determine. By a MIC-MAC cross-alignment ‘tiling’ method (described in Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we used each assembly to improve the other. By this process, most of the larger MIC scaffolds were linked into five chromosome-length super-assemblies that together incorporate 152 Mb of the total 157 Mb MIC assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1C,D</xref>; also see ‘MIC-scaff’ and corresponding ‘MAC-scaff’ schematic concatenations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While the super-assemblies are admittedly not perfect, their uncertainties are on a small scale, and thus the maps allow observations of general trends in MIC chromosome architecture. To our knowledge, these are the first assemblies of nearly full-length ciliate MIC chromosomes and thus represent novel resources for genomic analyses.

We observed that chromosome arm deletions never extend into the central regions of MIC chromosome super-assemblies, presumably because they are essential for centromere function. Operationally (because of how the deletions were mapped), two unique Cbs’s flank each putative centromere region (see red hash marks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Cytologically, all five <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> MIC chromosomes appear metacentric and, as expected, the midpoints of the chromosomal super-assembly lie near the centromeric region midpoints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We also note, as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>, that MAC chromosomes derived from MIC centromeric regions tend to be unusually large. The five putative centromeric regions range between 5.0 and 10.3 Mb and together comprise 37.8 Mb, or 24.7% of the assembled MIC genome.

Only at positions 13 and 14 have we observed more than one type of substitution (13T→A, C, or G, 14T→A or C).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19090.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Conservation of the 15 bp chromosome breakage sequence.</title><p>Nucleotide conservation was calculated at every position, as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hamilton et al., 2006a</xref>), for the 225 Cbs’s and their 15 bp flanking sequences, aligned on the C-rich Cbs strand.

specificity of the yet to be identified trans-acting factor(s) that physically interact with the Cbs. Pot2p is the first factor shown to associate specifically with Cbs regions in vivo, at the time of chromosome breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Cranert et al., 2014</xref>). Pot2p is a paralog of Pot1p, which is required for telomere maintenance. Pot2p may recruit factor(s) required for chromosome breakage and/or de novo telomere addition. As previously noted for the consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Yao et al., 1987</xref>), every functional Cbs contains a permuted copy (C<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>) of the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> telomeric repeat C<sub>4</sub>A<sub>2</sub>. More generally, the Cbs consensus shares with <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> telomeric repeats a striking C vs. G strand asymmetry; of the 117 non-consensus functional Cbs sequences, only one contains a substitution on the C-rich strand to a G (at position 13) whereas 27 contain a substitution to C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The likelihood of this ratio being due to chance alone is low (probability of chi square &lt;&lt; 0.01). Whether these sequence parallels between Cbs and telomeres are coincidental or related to Cbs function may be established when the mechanisms of chromosome breakage and telomere addition are better understood.</p><p>Many innovations in the realm of programmed genome rearrangement have resulted from the domestication of genes originally associated with mobile DNA elements; examples are found in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Kapitonov and Koonin, 2015</xref>) and microbial eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Barsoum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Koufopanou and Burt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Levin and Moran, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Sinzelle et al., 2009</xref>), including ciliates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Baudry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Vogt et al., 2013</xref>). The Cbs resembles the target site of a homing endonuclease, with its relatively long, non-palindromic sequence and limited degeneracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Fan and Yao, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hamilton et al., 2006b</xref>); another superficial resemblance is to transposase binding sites found at transposon termini. It seems likely that Cbs and the yet unknown protein(s) that recognize it and initiate breakage had their origins in a mobile DNA element that invaded the germline genome and was subsequently domesticated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Conservation of chromosome breakage sites across <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species</title><p>Cbs-mediated chromosome breakage has only been found in tetrahymenine ciliates. Earlier studies of this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Coyne and Yao, 1996</xref>) showed strong evolutionary conservation of the Cbs sequence, but only one or two Cbs's per species were sequenced. To examine the evolutionary conservation of Cbs sequences and their locations within the germline genome, we conducted a pilot study of 12 consecutive breakage site locations in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> and three other <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species, using the strategy described in Materials and methods (a more comprehensive study will be published separately). Strikingly, MAC chromosome ends were highly conserved in all four species, indicating strong conservation of breakage sites. Indeed, with just one exception in <italic>T. borealis</italic>, the location of every chromosome breakage site in the four species has remained identical since their divergence, down to the MIC genome interval between the same two consecutive homologous genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2C</xref>). The only detected differences are the deletion of DNA sequences surrounding <italic>T. borealis</italic> Cbs 3L-25 and a novel breakage site in <italic>T. malaccensis</italic>, between Cbs 3L-24 and 3L-25 (numbered according to <italic>T. thermophila</italic>).

No previously unidentified Cbs variants were observed in the 26 sequenced Cbs's (which include four locally duplicated Cbs's, see below). Importantly, there was consistency in the specific Cbs isoform found at a given breakage site in all four species, as expected if they represent a clade descended from a common ancestral Cbs at that site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This conclusion is further supported by the observation that Cbs’s at a given homologous breakage site display the same orientation with respect to MAC-retained flanking regions, with the single exception of <italic>T. borealis</italic> Cbs 3L-22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). In contrast to the conservation of the Cbs itself, there is little or no conservation of the 200 bp of adjacent sequence (not shown). Assuming the most parsimonious number of mutations to explain the Cbs variants observed at these nine homologous breakage sites, the rate of fixation of functional Cbs mutations is low; 11 mutations can account for all the Cbs variation observed at 31 independently sequenced sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This represents about 1.4 mutations fixed per breakage site since the divergence of these four species (corrected for eight unsequenced Cbs’s and counting locally duplicated Cbs copies – see below – only once).</p><p>The retention of a functional Cbs sequence at each of the studied sites, in contrast to the divergence of immediately adjacent sequence, provides evidence that Cbs’s, and therefore the positioning of chromosome breakage sites, are under purifying selection. In other words, it is functionally relevant to preserve the lengths and/or contents of specific MAC chromosomes. Further speculations on the possible nature of such selection are presented in the Appendix. The conservation of Cbs locations, and consequently the lengths of MAC chromosomes, is quite remarkable in contrast to the extremely variable locations of IESs, even in <italic>T. malaccensis</italic>, the species most closely related to <italic>T. thermophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Huvos, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-3"><title>Duplication of Cbs regions on an evolutionary time scale</title><p>Several reports document duplications of Cbs and surrounding sequences in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cassidy-Hanley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hamilton et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Yao et al., 1987</xref>). The pilot study described above revealed four Cbs duplications among the 22 sequenced sites in three other <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). There are also reported cases of inter-species Cbs inversions (above and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Coyne and Yao, 1996</xref>]). Further analyses of such events may shed light on aspects of Cbs evolutionary history. We searched for Cbs-associated germline rearrangements genome-wide and identified a large number of both local, tandem repeat duplications and long-range duplications/translocations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2E</xref>; summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Forty-nine Cbs-containing segments (23% of the 225) have at least one duplicate in the MIC genome. Evidence for an earlier duplication/translocation of the entire rDNA locus, including flanking Cbs’s, is described in the Appendix. This high frequency of Cbs-associated germline rearrangements supports the previous suggestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Coyne and Yao, 1996</xref>) that some mechanism increases the likelihood of such events in the vicinity of Cbs, perhaps as a result of occasional missorting of the chromosome breakage machinery to the germline nucleus. Tandem repeat duplications appear concentrated within and at the margins of putative centromeres, perhaps reflecting an increased tendency of that chromatin domain to engage in such illegitimate recombination events, or a higher tolerance for their consequences.<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19090.010</object-id><label>Table

section). Long-range duplications result in widely separated duplicate Cbs pairs, on either the same or different MIC chromosomes. Such events would increase the maintained chromosome number (unless translocation occurs to the neighborhood of a pre-existing Cbs). As an example noted above, a novel breakage site in <italic>T. borealis</italic> was possibly introduced by long-range duplication. More complete analysis of MAC synteny among several <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species, revealing genome-wide patterns of chromosome breakage conservation, will be presented separately. Future availability of MIC genome assemblies of these species will allow greater understanding of the frequency and consequences of long-range Cbs duplications.</p><p>The 49 Cbs-containing segment duplicates cluster into 15 sequence similarity groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2E</xref>; summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), which we call ‘clades’, to suggest that all members of each group were derived by successive duplications of an ancestral Cbs-containing segment. Some of these events probably occurred fairly recently, judging by the high-sequence identity of the Cbs-flanking regions. Within 14 out of 15 clades, members either have the same Cbs isoform (seven clades) or differ by a single substitution (seven clades). At least two mutations are required to explain the variation within the remaining clade. The doubly substituted 11C,13A Cbs is a relatively rare isoform found in more than one clade, suggesting they may form a ‘super-clade’. Further observations on Cbs duplication, including evidence for at least one, and possibly two, super-clades, and a model of Cbs-mediated chromosome breakage evolution are presented in the Appendix. By back-extrapolation, the identification of clades and possible superclades supports the suggestion that all current Cbs's are derived from one, or a few, founder copies present in a tetrahymenine ancestor. As described above, this founding event may have resulted from the invasion of the germline genome by a mobile element, followed by the domestication of an element-encoded gene to take over the mechanism of chromosome breakage from a pre-existing, less precise mechanism, such as that which persists in <italic>Paramecium</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-4"><title>Non-maintained MAC chromosomes</title><p>Our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cassidy-Hanley et al., 2005</xref>) identified two NMCs present in early sexual progeny (at 20 fissions after conjugation) but absent by ~120 fissions. A number of developmental events occur during this interval, including programmed genome rearrangement, the establishment of MAC chromosome copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Doerder and DeBault, 1978</xref>), and the transition from sexual immaturity to maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bleyman and Simon, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Rogers and Karrer, 1985</xref>). Because NMCs may play a role in these events, or serve as a model for their study, we undertook a genome-wide survey to identify more candidate NMCs and examine their properties. Using our MIC chromosome super-assemblies, we identified a total of 33 NMCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2F</xref>), operationally defined as MIC DNA segments delimited by two consecutive Cbs’s and absent from the MAC genome assembly.</p><p>To determine whether NMCs might contain genes that could function during conjugation or early post-conjugational development, we performed gene annotation on all NMCs greater than 1 kb in length. We identified 47 predicted genes, distributed among 10 NMCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2G</xref>). Some of them are homologous to genes found in the MIC-limited TEs REP and Tlr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Fillingham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Wuitschick et al., 2002</xref>), and others were annotated as transposases; therefore, the regions bearing these genes are likely recognized by the mechanism for IES removal and may, in fact, be processed as such, even though their flanking regions are not retained in the mature MAC. Nonetheless, RNA-seq evidence suggests that some NMC genes are expressed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2G</xref>) and may give rise to protein products that function during late conjugation and/or subsequent vegetative multiplication, until the NMCs are lost. For example, the five predicted genes with annotated transposase domains (one a piggyBac transposase, related to the domesticated transposase required for IES excision) may be involved in programmed somatic genome rearrangement (see below). The existence of expressed genes in transiently maintained NMCs may provide a novel mechanism for developmental gene regulation.</p><p>The mechanism(s) by which NMCs are lost from the MAC genome are of interest from the perspective of MAC chromosome maintenance, a poorly understood process involving DNA replication initiation and copy number control. We demonstrated that, in exconjugants at 24 hr post-mixing, all 20 NMCs longer than 1 kb have acquired telomeres (data not shown). Thus, telomere addition is not sufficient to fully stabilize these chromosomes. Moreover, whole genome sequencing data (not shown) from 24 hr exconjugants shows that all of the 13 largest NMCs (the only ones with sufficient read density for this determination) undergo developmental DNA endoduplication in concert with maintained MAC chromosomes, but it is currently unknown how rapidly NMC copy numbers decrease subsequently. The eventual loss of NMCs may result from the wide spacing of replication origins in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> genome. A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gao et al., 2013</xref>) identified roughly 7000 DNA segments that likely represent MAC DNA replication origins, an average of one per 15 kb, which corresponds to about 22.5 kb in the MIC genome, after adjusting for the average genome-wide IES fraction; only three NMCs are larger than this size. By contrast, in spirotrichous ciliates, a run-away evolutionary process, consistent with in silico predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Morgens et al., 2013</xref>), has led to extreme MAC chromosome fragmentation -- down to gene-sized ‘nanochromosomes’. This outcome was enabled by the evolution of independent DNA replication origins in association with nearly every gene in these ciliates. A lower origin density may have precluded such extreme chromosome fragmentation in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>.</p><p>How do NMCs arise? Recent Cbs duplication appears to be intimately connected to the evolutionary origin of most currently observed NMCs; roughly 80% (26/33) of NMCs have Cbs's from the same clade on both sides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2F</xref>). More than a third (13/33) of NMCs are short (1 kb or less) and contain no predicted genes; they likely have transient evolutionary existence, as their flanking, tandemly repeated Cbs’s are functionally redundant and mutations are statistically almost certain to eventually inactivate one of the flanking Cbs’s without penalty. However, it is possible that some very short NMCs could be maintained by selection if a defective Cbs near a newly broken end interfered with de novo telomere addition. Potentially, more interesting from an evolutionary perspective are the longer NMCs. A duplicated and translocated Cbs would have split a MAC chromosome into two fragments. The smaller one would become an NMC if it lacked cis-acting elements required for normal MAC chromosome maintenance. The resulting progeny would be viable if the NMC carried no genes essential for long-term vegetative multiplication. Over time, some of these developmentally short-lived MAC genes could undergo neo-functionalization for roles limited to post-zygotic and/or early post-conjugational development. Such NMC’s likely would have greater longevity on an evolutionary time scale.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Programmed DNA elimination</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Identification of IESs</title><p>Comparison of the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> MIC genome assembly (157 Mb) to that of the MAC (103 Mb) indicates that about one third of the MIC genome is eliminated during MAC differentiation, considerably more than the 10–20% previously estimated by reassociation kinetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Yao and Gorovsky, 1974</xref>).

For each of the five TDR classes between 0 and 4 bp, the direct repeat (or two flanking bases, in the case of no overlap) plus six bases on either side were extracted from the MIC genome sequence and aligned (MAC-destined sequence to the left; MIC-limited sequence to the right). Each arrow indicates the center of the TDR (or, in the case of No TDR, the junction point). Sequence logos derived from the alignments show that the TDRs are more AT-rich than surrounding sequence. Bases within the four, three, and two base direct repeats are approximately 97% AT overall and the one base direct repeats are 92% AT, whereas the two bases flanking the 'zero overlap' junctions are 80% AT, similar to the adjacent sequence composition. (<bold>C</bold>) Sequence pattern bias. In addition to overall AT-richness, the sequence patterns of the TDRs are not entirely random. We compared the frequency of each of the possible TDRs between 2 and 4 bp in length that consist of only As and Ts. Reverse complementary sequences were found to have approximately equal frequencies, as expected because the orientation of the sequenced strand is random, and they were grouped together. This makes for 10 groupings of 4 bp TDRs, 4 groupings of 3 bp TDRs, and 3 groupings of 2 bp TDRs. As shown in this panel, the frequencies of each grouping are unequal; the most common are: 4-mer TTAA (palindromic), 3-mer TTA/TAA, and 2-mer TT/AA (the latter two are pairs of reverse complementary sequences). Furthermore, it is notable that the four most common groupings of 4-mers all contain one member with a 5' TT dinucleotide (red font) and together account for two thirds of the total 4-mers. Likewise, the two (out of four total) 3-mer groupings containing a 5' TT dinucleotide account for two thirds of 3-mers, and the single TT/AA 2-mer grouping accounts for over three quarters of all 2-mers. These findings suggest that IES junctions have a slight bias in favor of beginning with TT and an extended weak consensus of 5'-TT(A)(A)−3', the most common 2, 3, and 4 bp TDRs (but far from the majority) including successively more of the consensus, from left to right.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19090.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19090.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19090-fig5-figsupp4-v2"/></fig></fig-group></p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Many IESs are related to transposable elements</title><p>Sequence similarity reveals little about the origins of many well-studied <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> IESs, but others show clear relatedness to TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Chalker and Yao, 2011</xref>).

Thus, we analyzed our MIC genome assembly to determine the extent to which IESs are related to TEs and the nature of these relationships. This annotation revealed that putative TEs and their remnants make up approximately 18.6 Mb (12.6%) of the total MIC genome assembly, and 10.9 Mb (41.7%) of the high-confidence IES set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary files 3B, 3C</xref>).

Retrotransposons appear to be infrequent in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>. Indeed, a small number (4.75% of the repeated DNA in the MIC) of non-LTR elements (mostly long interspersed nuclear elements, LINEs) was identified, but we found no evidence for the presence of any LTR retrotransposons. While retrotransposons are the predominant TE class in most eukaryotic genomes examined (mostly of plants, fungi, and animals; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Levin and Moran, 2011</xref>]), there are several other examples of eukaryotic genomes dominated by DNA TEs, including <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, and <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/genomicDatasets/RMGenomicDatasets.html">http://www.repeatmasker.org/genomicDatasets/RMGenomicDatasets.html</ext-link>).</p><p>Despite TEs being restricted to the transcriptionally silent MIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chalker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Coyne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Schoeberl and Mochizuki, 2011</xref>), we found evidence of very recent amplifications for the most abundant DNA cut-and-paste transposon superfamilies, based on the nearly identical sequences of some copies, as well as the presence of intact open-reading frames and terminal inverted repeats (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Therefore, unlike in some ciliates, <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> IESs are rarely found in MIC locations that give rise to MAC protein coding sequences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fass et al. (2011)</xref> identified the only reported exceptions. To confirm these cases, search for others, and characterize IESs within introns, we first reannotated the protein-coding genes of the MAC genome. The improved gene models were then mapped onto the MIC genome sequence. As expected, virtually all the high-confidence IESs are removed from predicted intergenic (6182, 82%) and intronic (1168, 16%) regions, where imprecise excision would not cripple gene function. The remaining 2% mapped within putatively protein-coding gene sequences, but on closer inspection, most of these cases represent apparent annotation errors. We identified six solid cases of coding region IESs, described further below.</p><p>When the densities of IESs and putative TEs are plotted along the length of each MIC chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; green and blue lines, respectively), we observe a pronounced elevation in the central and terminal regions (accompanied by a corresponding depression in the density of predicted genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> orange lines). We observe the reverse pattern on chromosome arms (although for unknown reasons, Chromosome 2 arms display higher IES density and correspondingly lower gene density than the other four). These results are consistent with the fact that shorter MIC scaffolds predominate at the middle and the ends of the MIC chromosomes, presumably because repetitive sequences in these regions make them difficult to assemble. The central regions, spanning approximately 7 to 12 Mb or about one quarter to one third of the chromosome lengths, share essentially the same range as the repeat-rich putative centromeric regions identified above. Thus, although <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> germline chromosomes are transcriptionally silent and carry dispersed elements destined for programmed elimination from the somatic genome, the general abundance of repetitive sequences and scarcity of genes in pericentromeric and sub-telomeric regions is similar to that observed in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Plohl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Pryde et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The genomic distribution of IESs also bears on the regulation of programmed DNA elimination. IES excision in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> relies on an RNAi-related mechanism, in which scnRNAs guide the epigenetic identification and targeting of IESs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Mochizuki and Gorovsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Vogt and Mochizuki, 2014</xref>). We previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Noto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Schoeberl et al., 2012</xref>) the existence of two distinct classes of scnRNAs, present at different stages of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> conjugation. Early-scnRNAs recognize not just the IESs they stem from, but other IESs in trans. Early-scnRNAs also induce the production of Late-scnRNAs, and both types are cooperatively involved in DNA elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Noto et al., 2015</xref>). Early-scnRNAs are produced primarily from shorter MIC scaffolds, whereas Late-scnRNAs originate from both large and small MIC scaffolds, but the locations of these scaffolds on MIC chromosomes was previously unknown. We found that, whereas Late-scnRNAs originate from locations throughout the MIC chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), Early-scnRNA primarily map to the middle and end regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The increased number of IESs in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) does not fully explain this phenomenon, because many IESs are located within chromosomal arm regions, but most do not give rise to Early-scnRNAs. We conclude some yet unknown mechanism restricts production of Early-scnRNAs to the central and terminal chromosome regions.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19090.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Densities of early (<bold>A</bold>) and late (<bold>B</bold>) scnRNAs on MIC chromosomes.</title><p>X-axis = position on MIC chromosome super-assembly; all graphs normalized to the same length.

Despite this shortening, there are relatively few documented cases of IES loss in <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnaiz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Catania et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, in the few cases studied, <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> IES positions appear to be highly variable between species, even those most closely related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Huvos, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2007</xref>). We hypothesize that <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> IESs proliferate in the MIC genome by TE movement (which our results suggest to be an ongoing process fueled by multiple invasions of diverse TEs), selectively constrained by the imprecise IES excision mechanism to intergenic and intronic positions. Unlike in <italic>Paramecium</italic>, there is not strong selection for a reduction in IES size. As <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> TE sequences gradually degenerate (and in the absence of both a precise excision mechanism and selective constraint on the precision of excision), the boundaries of IES removal shift, giving rise to the observed inter-species variability. Still, the small-RNA-mediated trans recognition network we have previously described and further refined above ensures that the overall pattern of IES excision is robust and reproducible from one sexual generation to the next. Because of the whole genome MIC/MAC comparison step in DNA elimination, this robustness is most likely necessary to avoid a complete breakdown in reproducibility, an event that might lead to reproductive isolation and speciation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-4"><title>New insights into <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> IES excision mechanism</title><p>Biochemical studies suggest that <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> IES excision occurs by a transposase-related mechanism initiated by a staggered, double-strand break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Saveliev and Cox, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">2001</xref>). Previous small-scale studies have shown that breakpoints do not share a strong consensus sequence and display frequent heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Austerberry et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Li and Pearlman, 1996</xref>). In some cases, IESs have short terminal direct repeats (TDRs) at their ends, one repeat remaining in the MAC following excision. The domesticated <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposase Tpb2p, required in vivo for IES excision, can introduce breaks in vitro of the expected geometry, and with a relaxed sequence preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>). To shed further light on this process, we examined thousands of additional IES junctions and conducted a genome-wide study of excision variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the range of variability in excision endpoints genome-wide, we purified and sequenced MAC DNA from a large pool of progeny from a mating between strains SB210 and SB1969, both belonging to the same inbred strain; MAC DNA from both parental strains served as controls. We aligned the sequencing reads to SB210 MIC scaffolds (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) to identify excision endpoints from multiple independent rearrangement events. Quantifying the degree of endpoint variation in a progeny pool depends on the experimental setup as well as the choice of validation criteria (as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> legend), making it hard to assign precise values. Nevertheless, even using conservative validation criteria, the great majority of IES sites exhibited variability, with up to 14 different junctions per site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Even for IESs that at first appeared to have no, or exceptionally low, variability, closer visual inspection of alignment data revealed that nearly all exhibited some endpoint variability. The scnRNA-mediated genome rearrangement mechanism involves whole genome comparison of the parental and newly developing MACs, with the state of the pre-rearranged parental genome influencing events in the progeny in a locus-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Mochizuki and Gorovsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Yao and Chao, 2005</xref>). Therefore, we examined the relationship of progeny to parental IES excision endpoints. Progeny endpoints were most often identical to those of the parent (26.6%), with most variations (83.3%) falling within 20 bp of the parental position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This observation is consistent with the proposal that cis-acting ‘boundary elements’ act to prevent the spread of chromatin marks specific to MIC-limited sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chalker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Godiska et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Li and Pearlman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Patil and Karrer, 2000</xref>). The progeny endpoint distribution shows a small spike at a distance of 4 bp from the parental endpoint. This would be consistent with the use of the same breakpoint, followed by differential repair of the four base overhang generated by Tpb2p, using either the 'right' or 'left' overhang as template.</p><p>The greatest number of IES junction sites (28%) displayed no TDRs, and another 47% displayed TDRs of between 1 and 4 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). These TDRs are more AT-rich than immediately adjacent regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>), but include a wide diversity of sequences, with minimal bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C</xref>). <italic>Paramecium</italic> also initiates IES excision by the action of a domesticated piggyBac transposase thought to be monophyletic with Tpb2. However, in contrast to the junctional diversity observed in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, the TA dinucleotide central to the four nucleotide overhang is invariant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnaiz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Gratias and Bétermier, 2003</xref>) and excision endpoint variability is extremely low. These features have allowed <italic>Paramecium</italic> IESs to frequently occupy protein-coding regions, whereas the imprecision of Tpb2p and the near total absence of IESs in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> protein-coding regions have most likely co-evolved to result in a strikingly different MIC genome landscape.</p><p>As mentioned above, we identified six Tetrahymena IESs that do fall within protein-coding regions, including three previously identified cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fass et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). These six IESs share four features that set them apart from the vast majority of other IESs. First, all six are flanked by TTAA terminal direct repeats (TDRs), one copy of which is retained in the MAC; this sequence feature is shared by only 2% of all <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> IESs. Second, these six IESs have a distinctive terminal inverted repeat (TIR), internal to the TTAA direct repeat, with a consensus of 5’- CACTTT-3’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 3D</xref>). This TIR resembles that of <italic>PiggyBac</italic> TEs of several species (as found in RepBase: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.girinst.org/repbase/index.html">http://www.girinst.org/repbase/index.html</ext-link> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Xu et al., 2006</xref>), and also the two full-length <italic>piggyBac</italic> consensus sequences annotated in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> MIC genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6—source datas 1</xref>; 5'-CCCT(A/T)T-3' for Contig[0117] and 5'-CCC(A/T)(C/T)T-3' for R = 3481). Third, the six coding region IESs are all exceptionally short; in fact, they include the three shortest IESs we identified (136, 188 and 194 bp, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 3D</xref>). Apart from their size and terminal sequences, no other conserved sequence features were detected, either within or flanking the IESs. Finally, these six IESs share the feature of exceptionally precise excision (as determined in the study of excision variability described above), as would be expected in order to maintain correct protein-coding capacity.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19090.024</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Coding region IESs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MIC structures of the five genes containing coding region IESs (thick black boxes).

We propose three testable hypotheses: first, this particular terminal sequence may allow these IESs to be processed by Tpb2p with unusually high fidelity. Second, an additional trans-acting factor may increase Tpb2p's specificity for these IES junctions. Finally, precise excision of these IESs may rely on one of the other p<italic>iggyBac</italic> transposase homologs identified in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>), one of which we have shown resides on a NMC (see above) and is expressed during conjugation.</p><p>A remaining question is why, as long as a mechanism exists for precise excision of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> coding region IESs, is their occurrence so exceedingly uncommon, especially in comparison with <italic>Paramecium</italic>, which employs a related piggyBac transposase mechanism for precise excision initiation, or conversely why has any precise excision at all persisted in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>? It was suggested, in the case of the LIA2 coding region IES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fass et al., 2011</xref>), that its excision may represent a novel form of gene regulation, turning on or off expression or allowing the expression of different protein products before and after rearrangement. We note that the five genes containing coding region IESs share certain intriguing features, suggesting that such regulation could serve relevant function(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The expression of all five is conjugation-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Miao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>), peaking at approximately the same time point (8–10 hr post-mixing; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tfgd.ihb.ac.cn/">http://tfgd.ihb.ac.cn/</ext-link>), near the time of IES excision. In addition, the predicted protein sequences contain functional domains of potential relevance to the regulation of gene function and/or MAC development, including zinc finger, bromodomain, and DEAD-DEAH helicase (Lia2p). Perhaps, the emergence of an efficient yet imprecise excision mechanism in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, based primarily on the epigenetic scnRNA mechanism to identify IESs and determine their boundaries, has driven selection against almost all coding region IESs that existed in a common ancestor of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> and <italic>Paramecium</italic>, with the few remaining <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cases persisting for gene regulatory purposes. Future studies of these five genes and six IESs will test this hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Conclusions and future directions</title><p>The assembly and analysis of the germline genome of <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> provides many new insights into the architectural differences between this genome and the remodeled somatic genome, the evolutionary history that shaped these genomes, and the developmental rearrangement mechanisms through which the somatic genome matures.

Two Illumina whole genome shotgun PCR-free fragment libraries were generated following published procedures, using the ‘with-bead’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Fisher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kozarewa et al., 2009</xref>).

Following DNA fragment end-repair and A-tailing, fragments were ligated on both ends with PCR-free-enabled TruSeq adapters (Illumina FC-121–2001) following manufacturer’s recommendations (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA).

Contiguous blocks of alignment (interrupted by IESs) to single MAC scaffolds were used to place MIC scaffolds in their natural order and orientation. To extend these contiguous blocks and join adjacent MIC or MAC scaffolds, we used a ‘tiling’ method, illustrated and described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. We constructed 'best approximation' super-assemblies of all five MIC chromosomes by combining the scaffold alignment overlap data with HAPPY mapping results. We also incorporated findings on seven cases of programmed DNA rearrangement events that join non-contiguous MIC genome regions into MAC chromosomes (see above). We found evidence suggesting a number of cases of MIC scaffold mis-assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>), but only two cases of MAC scaffold mis-assembly. This difference likely results from three factors: (1) the MIC genome contains many more repetitive sequences, (2) the MAC genome was assembled using long-read Sanger technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Eisen et al., 2006</xref>), and (3) the MAC assembly underwent extensive finishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Coyne et al., 2008</xref>).

First, we searched for Cbs family members in the MIC neighborhood that aligns with MAC chromosome telomere-addition sites. Second, we searched for Cbs’s directly in MIC supercontigs using a Perl script and the following regular expression for the Cbs family: ‘WAAACCAACCYCNHW’, where W = A or T, Y = C or T, N = any nucleotide and H = A, C or T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hamilton et al., 2006a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Detecting and clustering duplications of Cbs’s and their adjacent sequence</title><p>To detect duplications of Cbs-containing regions, we used 415 bp DNA segments containing each Cbs at the center and 200 bp of adjacent sequence on each side, referred to as ‘Cbs segments’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Table 3—source data 1</xref>). In four cases, the segments contained two or three Cbs’s, as adjacent Cbs were less than 400 bp apart. In such cases, we used a region that contained all such Cbs plus 200 bp flanking the outer Cbs’s. We used two independent methods to align and cluster Cbs segments. In method 1, the 225 segments were aligned with one another in all pairwise combinations using the ‘Align two sequences’ option of NCBI Blast (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004870">SCR_004870</ext-link>). Default parameters were used with the following exceptions: word size = 7, low complexity filter = OFF, and expect value threshold = 1E-15 Word size was set to seven because every functional Cbs has nine consecutive, absolutely conserved nucleotides. This choice ensured catching every alignment, and thus all segmental duplications that included the Cbs. The low complexity filter was set to OFF because non-genic portions of the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> genome are highly A+T-biased (the entire set of Cbs-flanking 400 bp segments is 86.6% A+T). Setting the low complexity filter to ON generally reduced the alignment to a small number of nucleotides on either side of the Cbs sequence and increased by one order of magnitude the exponent of the expected value of the best alignments. The 1E-15 threshold was empirically chosen by comparing expect values for alignments of the set of 225 Cbs segments with each other and with sets of randomized sequences; using this expect value threshold reduced spurious alignments between real and randomized sequences to a modest number. Randomized sequences were obtained as follows. For each Cbs segment, the Cbs was kept intact, but the 200 bp of flanking sequence on each side were randomized, while retaining the nucleotide frequency of the original sequence. Three independent randomized sets were generated. The center Cbs was kept intact to make the simulation equivalent to the real analysis. This was necessary because inclusion of a 15 bp highly conserved Cbs sequence results in a spurious decrease in the expect value of the alignment between any pair of Cbs segments.</p><p>The entire set of 225 sequences was used as the ‘subject’ database for all-by-all alignment. Smaller groups of the same sequences were used as ‘query’. We confirmed that the expect value of the alignment of a given Cbs region was not affected by how many Cbs segments were simultaneously used as query. Since we were interested in duplications that include the Cbs, alignments were considered only if Cbs’s aligned with one another. In a minority of cases (involving 11 Cbs’s), consecutive Cbs are less than 400 bp apart. Because of sequence overlaps in the 415 bp segments centered on such closely-spaced Cbs’s, the resulting self-matches would spuriously inflate the statistical significance of certain alignments and could lead to meaningless clusters. To deal with this issue, the individual Cbs-containing repeat units of closely-spaced-Cbs segments were split into non-overlapping pieces based on preliminary alignments and aligned with the 225 Cbs segments. As a consequence, some of the Cbs segments were significantly shorter than 415 bp, which raises the minimum expect values of their alignments. Cbs segments that aligned with at least one other segment with expect value equal or less than 1E-18 were clustered. We chose this threshold to exclude most false positives, based on the distribution of expect values for all-by-all alignments of the real sequences to the corresponding distribution for randomized vs. real sequences.</p><p>Method two started with an all-by-all Blastn alignment of the 225 Cbs segments also with low complexity filter = OFF. The expect value threshold was set at E-07. This threshold was obtained empirically by inspecting the clusters and alignments as described below, with a goal of having the largest clusters that still were conservative enough to generate good multiple sequence alignment. The Blastn matches were clustered using the mcl algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://micans.org/mcl/index.html?sec_thesisetc">http://micans.org/mcl/index.html?sec_thesisetc</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Van Dongen, 2000</xref>) with the pairwise scores set to the ratio of the bit score divided by the bit score of the sequence matched against itself (as is done in the IMG system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Markowitz et al., 2006</xref>]).

All but one of the 11 MAC chromosomes derived from this region initially assembled from telomere to telomere, and therefore, the region is unlikely to contain many repetitive sequences. This region is located on MIC chromosome 3 and contains 12 consecutive Cbs (3L-26 to 3L-15).

Homologous MAC supercontigs from <italic>T. malaccensis</italic>, <italic>T. elliotti</italic>, and <italic>T. borealis</italic> were identified by using blastn (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001598">SCR_001598</ext-link>) to search their genome assemblies (Accession numbers: <italic>T. malaccensis</italic> (PRJNA51577), <italic>T. elliotti</italic> (PRJNA51573), and <italic>T. borealis</italic> (PRJNA51575) using 20–25 kb segments from the ends of each <italic>T. thermophila</italic> MAC chromosome identified above. Next, guided by the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> MIC chromosome 3 super-assembly, we constructed pseudo-assemblies of the homologous MIC chromosome segments for each of the other three species (called pseudoassemblies because they lack IES’s, whose absence does not affect the connectivity of the MAC-destined sequences). Based on the assumption that these pseudoassemblies are colinear with the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> super-assemblies, we predicted the location of MIC Cbs. A more complete analysis of synteny between these and other <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species will be presented in a later paper.</p><p>To establish whether Cbs’s are indeed present at the predicted sites, we followed the general Cbs sequencing strategy of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Hamilton et al. (2005)</xref>. The MIC-specific region, expected to contain a Cbs, was PCR amplified from whole cell DNA using primers from the ends of each pair of MAC chromosomes predicted to be adjacent in the MIC. The amplified product was sequenced directly (without cloning), either after reaction cleanup or, if necessary, gel purification (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). With one exception, PCR products were sequenced from both strands or from reactions with different primer combinations. The sequence was then aligned with a short concatenated sequence from neighboring MAC chromosomes (telomeres or Ns deleted) to verify that the correct product was obtained and to delineate the MIC-specific segment. For alignments, we used LALIGN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/LALIGN_form.html">http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/LALIGN_form.html</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011819">SCR_011819</ext-link>) and Needle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py#forms::needle">http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py#forms::needle</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008493">SCR_008493</ext-link>), most often with default settings, although in some cases the gap start penalty was decreased. A Cbs, presumably functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hamilton et al., 2006b</xref>), was found in the middle of the MIC-specific segment of every genuine PCR product.</p><p><italic>T. elliotti</italic> supercontigs 14, 30, and 46 presented special problems in the assembly; these supercontigs appear to be concatenates of homologs of several <italic>T. thermophila</italic> MAC chromosomes linked by blocks of N’s at the sites where MAC chromosome ends are predicted. To determine whether these long supercontigs truly represent a single chromosome or were due to misassembly problems, we amplified regions of presumed fusion events with primers on both sides of the Ns. Amplification products were sequenced at locations homologous to 3L-26, 3L-21, 3L-20, and 3L-16; all four were found to contain known Cbs sequences.</p><p>To prove that the Cbs sequences are functional, we set out to find telomeres at the ends of MAC chromosomes that flank each Cbs identified in the three relatives of <italic>T. thermophila</italic>. This was done in one of the following ways: (1) Many of the MAC supercontigs had assembled telomere sequence (CCCCAA or its reverse complement) at one or both ends; (2) At ends where telomere sequence repeats did not assemble, or adjacent to blocks of Ns in <italic>T. elliotti</italic>, we were sometimes able to identify telomere repeat-containing sequence reads from the Sequence Read Archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra</ext-link>) that aligned with the incomplete MAC supercontig assembly; (3) In other cases, a telomere was experimentally identified by PCR amplification using a primer specific to the terminal DNA sequence paired with a generic telomere sequence primer, as described by Hamilton et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Hamilton et al., 2005</xref>). The presence of a single (or major) PCR product, consistent with the predicted product size, was taken as evidence for the presence of telomeres at that chromosome end. For confirmation, some of these telomere-containing PCR products were cloned into the PCR2.1 vector using the Invitrogen TA cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and sequenced. Several clones were sequenced in each case —as in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, microheterogeneity in the telomere addition site was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fan and Yao, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hamilton et al., 2006b</xref>); (4) A supercontig containing two MAC chromosomes separated by a block of N’s was revealed in the case of the <italic>T. elliotti</italic> homolog of Cbs 3L-26; two bands were seen after hybridization to Southern blots of pulsed-field gels of <italic>T. elliotti</italic> DNA (data not shown). Using the same method, we indirectly confirmed the existence of Cbs 3L-21 by confirming the length of the MAC chromosome that flanked the Cbs. Using these methods, a telomere-capped MAC end was identified on at least one side of every Cbs studied, confirming Cbs functionality.</p><p>In order to verify at higher resolution the location of putative homologous Cbs’s in the four species, we looked for homology of predicted protein-coding sequences flanking every one of the 12 identified or predicted Cbs’s in the three species to the corresponding gene models in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>. This was done by aligning 2500–5000 bp of DNA sequence adjacent to each end of every MAC supercontig in the other species to the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> protein database at TGD using blastx (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001653">SCR_001653</ext-link>). This was done to circumvent any potential gene annotation errors in the three other species.

By these criteria, we identified 29,794 simple repeats (constituting 2.9 Mb, or 1.9% of the MIC scaffold sequence, excluding Ns). However, this number is likely an underestimate of the overall MIC genome repeat content. Because of the numerous gaps in the MIC genome assembly, approximately 6.4% (constituting 10.0 Mb) consists of Ns. Because repeat-rich sequences are difficult to assemble, the unassembled parts of the genome are likely to contain many more repeats. By comparison, the MAC genome assembly, which is much more complete, contains far fewer Ns. Using the same Tandem Repeat Finder parameters as for the MIC, we identified 22,216 simple sequence repeats (constituting 3.5 Mb, or 3.4% of the MAC assembly, excluding Ns).

These mappings were used to detect 'split reads', adjacent parts of which mapped (in the same orientation) to two separate locations on the same MIC scaffold, putatively due to the presence of an IES in the region spanned by the read. To reduce false positive identifications, we required that every 'high confidence' IES be supported by at least three spanning reads, that the IES have low MAC read coverage (&lt;1X, compared with overall average of 9.3X for MAC-destined regions; low coverage may occur due to MIC contamination of the original MAC libraries), and that the IES not begin or end with a sequencing gap.</p></list-item><list-item><p>MIC read alignment to MAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). MIC genomic reads from this study were mapped to the MAC genome assembly using BWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Li and Durbin, 2010</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010910">SCR_010910</ext-link>).

We identified reads whose alignment of stops before their ends (putatively because such reads contain IES sequence at their ends). At least six such 'broken' reads were required to validate a 'residual' IES site in the MAC genome. Also, we required that at least one broken read must face the residual site from each direction, with alignment breakpoints within 10 bp of each other. Most breakpoints from the 'left' or 'right' read direction were either adjacent or overlapped slightly, indicating a short direct repeat at the IES junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>MIC-MAC cross-assembly alignment. All MAC and MIC scaffolds were aligned to one another using nucmer (criteria: percent identity &gt; 95, alignment length &gt; 1000 bp; Mummer package RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001200">SCR_001200</ext-link>). The presence of a putative IES was deduced by a larger gap (&gt;100 bp difference) in adjacent alignment endpoints in the MIC genome than the corresponding endpoint gap in the MAC genome.</p></list-item></list><p>Applying stringent criteria, the first method identified 7757 putative IESs; nearly all were corroborated by one or both of the other two methods. Following manual curation, a final 'high confidence' set of 7551 IESs remained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 3A</xref>). An important criterion for inclusion in the high-confidence set is that the precise junction positions must be identified; internal assembly gaps are permitted, but gaps at IES/MDS junctions are not. In contrast to IES mapping method number one above, the other two mapping methods frequently identified putative IESs with terminal assembly gaps or, in many cases, consisting entirely of gap regions. These gaps are likely the result of two factors: (1) repetitive sequences within the IESs and (2) minor contamination of the MIC sequencing libraries with MAC DNA (the resulting mixture of inconsistent short reads at IES/MDS junctions causing the assembly algorithm to introduce 'breaks'). Nevertheless, manual curation indicates that IESs likely exist at the great majority of these sites. Each of the latter two methods identified about 12,000 IESs in total, twice the number previously estimated based on extrapolation from a highly limited subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Yao et al., 1984</xref>) or low-coverage MIC genome sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fass et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the validity of exceptionally short (&lt;250 bp) or long (&gt;25 kb) IESs, the read alignments were visually inspected using a JBrowse instance. IESs &lt; 250 bp in length and three slightly larger coding region IESs were also confirmed by PCR amplification from a SB210 MIC genomic DNA sample with flanking primers using Q5 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) or Platinum Taq HiFi DNA polymerase (Life Technologies-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Expected sizes of MIC and MAC (from minor contamination of the template) amplification products were confirmed by gel electrophoresis. In one case where an exonic IES was within a sequencing gap, the MIC PCR product was cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) and sequenced on both strands.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Repeat analysis</title><p>A library of repeats for the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> MIC genome was built by combining known transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Jurka et al., 2005</xref>), all previously described TE families in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Fillingham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Tsao et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Wells et al., 1994</xref>), and repeats identified de novo (Supplementary Dataset 1). To build the latter, we used RepeatScout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Price et al., 2005</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014653">SCR_014653</ext-link>) with default parameters (&gt;3 copies) to generate consensus repeat sequences. Those with greater than 90% sequence identity and a minimum overlap of 100 bp were assembled using Sequencher (v 4.07; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001528">SCR_001528</ext-link>). Repeats were classified into TE families using multiple lines of evidence, including detection of conserved TE protein domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Marchler-Bauer et al., 2011</xref>), homology to known elements, presence of Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs), and detection of Target Site Duplications (TSDs). Homology-based evidence was obtained using RepeatMasker Protein Mask (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Smit et al., 2015</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_012954">SCR_012954</ext-link>), as well as the homology module of the TE classifying tool RepClass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Feschotte et al., 2009</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014654">SCR_014654</ext-link>). Repclass was also used to identify some of the signatures of transposable elements (TIRs, TSDs). We then eliminated non-TE repeats (simple repeats or gene families). First, consensus sequences were labeled as simple repeats or low complexity if 80% of their length could be annotated as such by RepeatMasker (masking of the library with the option –noint; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_012954">SCR_012954</ext-link>). Next, consensus sequences were interrogated against protozoan refseq mRNAs (release 58) with tblastx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011823">SCR_011823</ext-link>), and considered as non-TEs when: 1) evalue of the hit was lower than 1E-10; 2) the consensus sequence was not annotated as a TE; and 3) the hit was not annotated as a transposase. To facilitate this step, we used custom perl scripts available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/4ureliek/ReannTE">https://github.com/4ureliek/ReannTE</ext-link>.</p><p>A selected subset of 32 of the 1674 resulting repeats was manually verified and consensus sequences were curated. Two non-exclusive criteria were used to select sequences for manual annotation: highest genome coverage or lowest divergence between copies (e.g. potentially recently active elements), based on a preliminary repeat annotation of the genome with RepeatMasker. Presumably, because of the large size and complex structure of <italic>Maverick</italic>/Tlr elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pritham et al., 2007</xref>), we could not identify any complete elements in the MIC assembly (the only copy that we could annotate within a unique scaffold was lacking some internal domains). Lastly, we further classified the remaining unclassified repeats (1480/1674), using a k-mer-based method and were able to assign classification for an additional 161 repeats. The use of this k-mer based tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Flygare et al., 2016</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014655">SCR_014655</ext-link>; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Yandell-Lab/taxonomer_0.5">https://github.com/Yandell-Lab/taxonomer_0.5</ext-link>) allowed us to test whether each copy of all unclassified repeats (query) could be classified as any copies of any classified repeats (database). The query's classification was updated to reflect the classification of the majority of its copies with significant scores. Repeats that showed inconsistent classification (such as DNA or LINE1 depending on copies) remained unclassified. Most repeats (1319) remain unclassified and may correspond to either TEs or to non-TE repeats: therefore, we refer to this custom library as putative TEs.</p><p>The <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> MIC and MAC genome assemblies were masked with RepeatMasker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Smit et al., 2015</xref>) using the refined repeat library (options –s and –nolow).

Differences in the results were resolved at JCVI. The strand-specific RNAseq data described above and non-strand-specific RNAseq data generated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>) were assembled using Inchworm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Grabherr et al., 2011</xref>) (Trinity package, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013048">SCR_013048</ext-link>).

The gene structures of about 2700 inchworm assemblies with long open-reading frames (ORFs) and full-length gene structure support (i.e. a complete start-to-stop ORF preceded by an in-frame stop) were extracted and randomly split in half; one set was used for ab initio gene finder training while the other set was used to evaluate gene finder performance. Based on our previous experience with annotation of oligohymenophoran ciliate genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Coyne et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Eisen et al., 2006</xref>), we focused on the gene finders Genezilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Majoros et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">2005</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014657">SCR_014657</ext-link>) and Augustus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Stanke and Morgenstern, 2005</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008417">SCR_008417</ext-link>). Parameters were iteratively modified by automated implementation of algorithmic scripts to optimize sensitivity and specificity of gene finder performance. We also searched the full genome assembly for protein homology and identifiable protein domains using the Analysis and Annotation Tool (AAT) package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Huang et al., 1997</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014658">SCR_014658</ext-link>) against in-house, curated databases of non-redundant protein sequences (allgroup) and PFAM domains (TIGRFAM; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005493">SCR_005493</ext-link>).

Gene models were updated using PASA and the RNAseq assemblies described above as well as approximately 60,000 previously generated, Sanger ESTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Coyne et al., 2008</xref>). Omissions and structural differences between the three models (the new and previous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Coyne et al., 2008</xref>] JCVI annotations and the Broad Institute annotation) were assessed using GSAC (Gene Structure Annotation Comparison, unpublished), a JCVI in-house tool that evaluates coordinate differences between two gff3 (generic feature format version 3) files. Models present in either of the latter two annotations, but absent from the the new JCVI annotation, were evaluated and included in the final set if they met either of the following criteria: significant homology to a predicted gene in NCBI's non-redundant protein database (nr) or microarray evidence of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Miao et al., 2009</xref>). Manual annotation steps were performed to correct cases of gene model overlap on the same or opposite strand, to edit or add genes curated on TGD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ciliate.org">www.ciliate.org</ext-link>), and to correct translation of genes encoding selenocysteine-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Coyne et al., 2008</xref>). Ab initio models that were fewer than 50 codons in length and lacked support from transcriptomic, protein homology or domain evidence were deleted. Functional gene product names were assigned by implementation of a JCVI pipeline designed to weigh multiple sources of sequence evidence, select the best supported names, and homogenize nomenclature within paralogous families.</p><p>To evaluate the protein-coding potential of MIC-limited genomic regions, we applied similar methods to the set of 5625 fully sequenced IESs and 21 NMCs &gt; 500 bp in length. Gene-finding algorithms Augustus and Genezilla, trained on MAC genome data as described above, were applied to generate ab initio gene predictions. Unfortunately, the available RNAseq reads were often unable to validate and improve these predictions. In a separate study, Gao et al. (unpublished) used RNAseq evidence from a specific time point during conjugation to model a number of MIC-limited genes located within both IES and NMC regions. Full characterization of the IES transcripts will be presented in a later paper. For this study, genes within NMCs were hand-curated for maximum reliability. Many of these NMC models also had RNAseq support within our available evidence (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Small RNA analyses</title><p>Small RNA purification, co-immunoprecipitation, and analyses by denaturing gel electrophoresis were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Noto et al., 2010</xref>).

We mated the sequenced reference strain SB210 to SB1969 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/TSC_SD00701">TSC_SD00701</ext-link>). Both are whole-genome homozygous cell lines of <italic>T. thermophila</italic> inbred strain B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Gibson, 1973</xref>). Many fissions after they last conjugated, both strains were subcloned from a single cell, ensuring that essentially every MAC locus has become homozygous through phenotypic assortment, eliminating parental MAC IES excision endpoint variation; our sequence analysis verified this prediction. Mating exconjugants were selected for resistance to cycloheximide (the allele for which is found in the MIC genome of SB1969 and only expressed in true progeny) in 96-well plates at a dilution that limited the number of independent resistant progeny pairs in each well to an average of two. After 3 days growth in cycloheximide, resistant cells from 330 wells were pooled. This pool contained the vegetative descendants of about 660 mating pairs, or 1320 individual progeny. In each progeny cell, two MACs develop and undergo programmed genome rearrangement; thus, the pool represents about 2640 independently derived MACs, but given that IES excision occurs when the MAC ploidy is about 8°C, the diversity of excision endpoints is potentially even greater. To expand the cell population for MAC DNA purification, the pooled cells were grown for approximately eight cell divisions in a large volume of medium to minimize competition. MACs from the progeny pool, as well as both parental strains, were purified by standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Gorovsky et al., 1975</xref>) and DNA prepared from the nuclei. Illumina (San Diego, CA) sequencing libraries, with a fragment size of about 600 bp, were prepared from each DNA sample and sequenced (2 × 100 base paired-end reads) using an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument following manufacturer’s recommendations. MAC genome coverage of each sample was: SB210 = 27X, SB1969 = 66X, Progeny Pool = 156X.

The relative ease with which duplications, deletions, circular permutations and gene conversions can occur in tandem repeats suggests that the duplication history in any tandem repeat clade is likely to be complex. Thus, only a minimum, representative number of events can be inferred from the current state of the repeats.</p><p>b. The generation of the first two tandem repeats, containing a substantial length of repeated sequence, is likely the rate-limiting step in the expansion because the first duplication likely depends on microhomology-dependent non-homologous end joining. Additional duplications (and deletions) of tandem repeat units are likely to follow with higher frequency due to unequal crossing-over, i.e., non-allelic homologous recombination, greatly facilitated by the presence of neighboring repeat copies that can align out of register with one another (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). These events must occur in the MIC, either during meiosis or as a result of DNA damage repair during vegetative multiplication.</p><p>c. Because unequal crossover generates a pair of reciprocal products, representing duplication and deletion, the number of repeats in a clade is elastic during evolutionary time. Thus, the current number of repeats may be but a snapshot of a dynamic process and the history shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref> may represent just one among many possibilities.</p><p>d. Duplications are generated as immediately adjacent pairs in the simplest unequal cross-over model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 3A</xref>). The order of forks in the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>) leaves the repeats in scrambled order, 1,2,4,3,+,5 instead of 1,2,3,4,+,5, differing by a circular permutation of repeats 3 and 4. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 3B</xref> shows how a series of duplications/deletions caused by unequal crossovers can generate the circular permutation. On the other hand, the branching of the tree may be incorrect, as the bootstrap values are not very high. Furthermore, the recombination junctions in successive unequal crossover events need not occur at equivalent nucleotide locations; this may decrease statistical support for the phylogenetic tree and blur its relationship to the physical order of the repeats.</p><p>e. Two distinct mutation events -- the minimum number required to generate the three functional Cbs variants observed in this clade -- are invoked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). The clade ancestor is assumed to have had the Cbs 11C variant as that is the possibility most simply consistent with the repeat history embodied in the phylogenetic tree. These mutations become convenient markers for the repeats.</p><p>f. Interestingly, the Cbs in the fifth repeat copy has mutated to a variant having an AAC insertion between Cbs positions 7 and 8. The Cbs is almost certainly non-functional, as the two positions are invariant among nearly 200 functional Cbs’s that define the ends of the maintained MAC chromosomes. The 2R-1 clade is a tandem repeat containing three repeat units, averaging 311 bp per repeat unit. Every Cbs shares the 14A substitution. Similar to the 1L-1 clade, the middle repeat contains a presumably nonfunctional Cbs with a 9T substitution. Thus, Cbs’s are subject to ‘birth’ (duplication) and ‘death’ (mutation to a non-functional variant) evolutionary events.</p><p>g. Because the predicted MAC chromosomes defined by these Cbs’s are non-maintained (NMCs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2F</xref>, main text), none of these duplication events would have affected the number of maintained chromosomes in the MAC genome. Furthermore, the repeat length is very short and there are no predicted genes within these repeats. This raises the question of why this clade contains five Cbs’s that have retained functionality when just one would suffice. The simplest answer would be that the duplication events occurred very recently, a conclusion supported by the high degree of Cbs-flanking sequence conservation observed (see alignment in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>, section A1).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19090.032</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 3.</label><caption><title>Examples of unequal crossing over.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Repeat unit duplication.

These Cbs’s were the first to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Yao et al., 1985</xref>).

The matching segment in chromosome 4R includes one functional Cbs, 4R-25, as well as 381 bp which matches a segment at the 5’ end of the MAC rDNA, including the 112 bp region containing the M-repeat copies and their non-palindromic spacer (see alignment and sequences in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>, section A3). The duplicated/translocated sequence most likely had only 2 Cbs’s at this end, as the expected value of a chance BlastN alignment further decreases by at least 4 orders of magnitude if the 45 bp 1L-17 repeat unit is deleted (data not shown). Given the nearly complete sequence identity of the Cbs 1L-17 and 18 repeat units, it seems likely that they were generated by a more recent duplication than the 1L-4R duplication/translocation event. Cbs 4R-25 is probably homologous to Cbs 1L-19 because both share a 13A substitution. The 13A substitution is not seen in Cbs 1L-18 or the degenerate (non-functional) Cbs that occupies the corresponding location on 4R (compare the MIC sequences of the 5’ rDNA region and the region including Cbs 4R-24 and 25). Remarkably, the sequence adjacent to the Cbs at the other (3’) end of the rDNA sequence, Cbs 1L-16, matches the sequence adjacent to Cbs 4R-24, the nearest neighbor of Cbs 4R-25, separated from it by only 656 bp (see alignment of Cbs 4R-24 and 3’ rDNA end and their sequences in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>, section A3). The matching sequence includes 129 bp of sequence similar to the non-transcribed segment at the 3’ end of the rRNA gene.</p><p>It is very likely that the entire MIC rDNA chromosome sequence and flanking Cbs’s were translocated in a single event. As can be seen in the sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>, section A3), the segments that match the rDNA 5’ (dark gray) and 3’ (light gray) ends are only 27 bp apart. If the duplication/translocation went from 1L to 4R, the probability of two independent duplications/translocations ending up 27 bp apart in a &gt;150 Mb genome are remote. Conversely, if independent duplication/translocations went from 4R to 1L, and given that the M-repeats sequence is dispensable for the cell but their inverted deployment is required for rDNA palindrome formation, it is not easy to explain why both segments were in 4R, unless they already flanked a complete, functional copy of the rDNA. Consistent with the single translocation hypothesis, the homologous Cbs’s have the same orientation with respect to one another and Cbs duplication-and-translocations to a different chromosome tend to be rarer than to the same chromosome (main text, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2E</xref>).</p><p>These considerations lead us to conclude that the entire ~11 kb rDNA segment, including the flanking Cbs’s, was duplicated and translocated from MIC chromosome 1R to 4R (or vice versa). Subsequently, an internal segment, representing most of the rDNA, was deleted from the 4R copy. The excision site can be pinpointed to the 27 bp gap between the 5’ and 3’ matching segments in the sequence interval between Cbs’s 4R-24 and 25 (see sequence in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>, section A3). Since MAC rDNA palindrome copy number is regulated at nearly 10,000 copies per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Pearlman et al., 1979</xref>), neither the putative rDNA gene duplication nor its subsequent deletion need have affected final rDNA copy number in the MAC. Furthermore, since a naturally occurring mutation can cause differential replication/maintenance of one allelic form and complete replacement of the other form in heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Pan et al., 1982</xref>), a redundant copy could readily become entirely superfluous.</p><p>The simplest sequence of duplication/ translocation and Cbs mutation events that accounts for the current organization at both MIC chromosomes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>.

It follows that this difference must have arisen after these two species lineages diverged from the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> lineage. The same must be true for the 1R-4R rDNA duplication described above, as Cbs 4R-24 shows the same orientation with respect to the remnants of the flanking rDNA homologous DNA sequence. Not enough MIC sequence is available from the two other species to determine if the resulting inversion was an ‘in situ’ inversion or whether some other duplicated Cbs was translocated to the sequence adjoining the rDNA 3’end. Partial MIC sequences, adjacent to the 5’ end of the rRNA gene, are available for two <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species (<italic>T. pigmentosa</italic> and <italic>T. hegewischi</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Coyne and Yao, 1996</xref>); no evidence of sequence similarity is observed in this region between these species and <italic>thermophila</italic>. By analogy to the 3’ end Cbs, it seems very likely that the Cbs tandem repeat duplication in <italic>thermophila</italic> occurred after its divergence from the <italic>pigmentosa</italic> and <italic>hegewischi</italic> lineages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s39" sec-type="appendix"><title>On the evolution of Cbs-mediated chromosome breakage in tetrahymenine ciliates</title><p>Although ciliate chromosome breakage is universally conserved, the tetrahymenine Cbs-mediated mechanism has not been found in any other ciliate group studied. Furthermore, there has been little divergence in the Cbs sequence itself within the tetrahymenine lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Coyne and Yao, 1996</xref> and this study). It is therefore likely that the Cbs-mediated mechanism for chromosome breakage was introduced fairly recently into the tetrahymenine lineage, after its divergence from that of ciliates in closely related groups, such as <italic>Paramecium</italic>. Additional lines of evidence consistent with this view have been presented in main text. How could the Cbs-mediated mechanism have taken over an ancestral mechanism of chromosome breakage?</p><p>As discussed in main text, there are strong reasons to believe that preservation of both the extent and locations of chromosome breakage in tetrahymenine ciliates are under purifying selective pressure. The tetrahymenine branch diverged from ciliates that already had highly evolved MAC biology, including programmed chromosome breakage, and by inference, an ancestral chromosome breakage system already optimized by natural selection. This suggests that the spread of Cbs’s may have been largely restricted to pre-existing breakage sites. In any case, rampant spread of breakage sites in the germline would certainly be deleterious to progeny survival. Transposons often display adaptations that avoid damaging host fitness; for example, the yeast Ty1 transposon inserts almost exclusively at &quot;safe&quot; sites upstream of promoters for RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes, by virtue of its targeting through association with a subunit of that enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bridier-Nahmias and Lesage, 2012</xref>). It is conceivable that the invading Cbs mobile element was targeted to preexisting sites of chromosome breakage by association of its transposase with one of the recognition factors involved in that ancestral process. Of course, in order to be heritable, this targeting would need to occur in the germline, where breakage does not normally occur, but perhaps the putative association drew the complex from its normal site of action, in the macronuclear anlage, into the germline nucleus, much as an HIV pre-integration complex can traverse the interphase nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bukrinsky, 2004</xref>). Once in the micronucleus, mobile element integration at multiple pre-existing chromosome breakage sites might proceed (without resulting in germline chromosome breakage). In time, the Cbs endonuclease would be domesticated and all traces of the original mobile element, with the exception of the 15 bp Cbs, would degenerate by random mutation. Presuming a selective advantage for the highly precise and reliable Cbs-mediated breakage mechanism over the ancestral state, the new state would become fixed in the population.</p><p>Ultimately, validation or rejection of this speculative model will rest on the discovery of the endonuclease complex responsible for Cbs-mediated chromosome breakage. It is notable that a homolog of a telomerase subunit, Pot2, was recently found to associate with chromosome breakage sites in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Cranert et al., 2014</xref>). It may take part in the telomerase-dependent healing of the newly broken ends. Perhaps it may serve as the bait by which other components of the breakage complex may be identified. Alternatively, screening of homing endonuclease- and transposase-related genes in the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> genome may trigger discovery of an association with programmed chromosome breakage.</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="article-commentary" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19090.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name><role>Reviewing editor</role><aff id="aff12"><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution>, <country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor (Kathleen Collins), and three reviewers.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the manuscript provides many interesting insights about what sequence comparison between Mic and Mac tells us about <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> biology, genome rearrangements, and evolution. The interesting observations include the presence of non-maintained chromosomes, genome un-scrambling, and the evolution of chromosome breakage sites (CBS), and the size, nature and elimination of the Mic centromeric repeated DNA.</p><p>The manuscript has some remaining issues that need to be addressed before it would be considered as accepted, as outlined below. In particular, all three reviewers and the Reviewing Editor believe that the work will have its highest impact if it is more readable to general audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. The text body could have provided a bit more guidance for readers as to the general take-home implications of their findings, as detailed below. In addition, the manuscript would benefit from having a summary figure illustrating the major findings: repeat rich centromeric regions, conserved CBS positions, and non-maintained chromosomes.</p><p>1) Much of the information from the subsections “MIC Genome Sequencing and Assembly” and “Building and Analysis of Chromosome-Length MIC Super-Assemblies” could be stated in a summary fashion in the text and the details that are presented could be put in the Methods or in supplemental material.

It would be helpful to have a figure to follow what the authors have found. They state another manuscript will address this, but if they are going to report this at least to some degree here, a figure and a bit more detail about what is different would help a lot.</p><p>3) The first six paragraphs of the subsection “MIC Centromeres” could be shortened and condensed. The whole section is particularly long and speculative, and in places repetitive. The concept of meiotic drive in inserted in the middle of the description of the structure and comparison to other organisms. Can the section be edited to tighten up the prose and perhaps shortened?</p><p>4) The discussion of the programed elimination of Cen sequences in the sixth paragraph of the subsection “MIC Centromeres” needs to have a figure to allow the reader to follow the structures that are being referred to.</p><p>5) The seventh paragraph of the subsection “MIC Centromeres” discusses non-maintained chromosomes, which is discussed later. This does not belong under the heading &quot;MIC Centromeres&quot; where it currently is.</p><p>6) In the ninth paragraph of the subsection “MIC Centromeres”, the discussion of transcripts from mic sequences is really a summary of the literature and a hypothesis and should be in a dedicated discussion, not in the middle of a section on centromeres.</p><p>7) The discussion of Cbs's in the subsections “The Chromosome Breakage Sequence (Cbs) Family”, “The Set of 225 Cbs’s in the MIC Genome” and “Degeneracy of the Cbs motif among functional Cbs’s”, should be significantly condensed. The consensus sequence was already known, so to authors should spend less time of this, and just start the new information that the additional sequences offer.</p><p>8) Likewise the discussion of the conservation of CBS's across species in the subsections “Conservation of chromosome breakage sites across <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species” and “Duplication of Cbs Regions on an Evolutionary Time Scale”, should be significantly shortened and combined with the identification of CSB sites discussed above.</p><p>9) The subsection “The Non-Maintained MAC Chromosomes” could be combined with the discussion of phenotypic assortments in the tenth paragraph of the subsection “MIC Centromeres” and this section should be shortened.</p><p>10) The summary and conclusion would not be needed if the authors state the results and then wrote a concise Discussion.</p><p>11) On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it seems like it might be helpful if the authors denoted the region which they consider to contain the centromere of each chromosome.</p><p>12) In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Duplication of Cbs Regions on an Evolutionary Time Scale”, it needs a period after &quot;relatedness&quot;.</p><p>13) In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Duplication of Cbs Regions on an Evolutionary Time Scale”. The idea about the CBS being introduced by a transposon invasion leading to the use of this sequence as the chromosome fragmentation site is compelling, but the way it is described is rather non-committal. It would not be &quot;related&quot; to a transposon invasion, it would result from the invasion and subsequent domestication of the breakage enzyme. This is one example related to my general comment that the manuscript could be written more succinctly and clearly.</p><p>14) The description of the possible role of RNAi and Dicer-like 1 in centromere function should be de-emphasized. In addition to the Mochizuki, K et al. (2004) paper cited for the role of Dcl1 in mitosis and meiosis, a second study, Malone, CD et al. (2005) examined the phenotypes of loss of Dcl1 function and observed no evidence for any role of Dcl1 in chromosome segregation. The differences between the two studies' findings were never reconciled so using only one study as supporting information for the Discussion may be misleading to the less informed reader.</p><p>15) This manuscript incorporates data from two other manuscripts. Namely the transposable element (TE) annotation (Kapusta et al.) and the deletion mapping (Cassidy-Hanley et al.), data used for chromosome landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and to delineate centromeric regions of the 5 germline chromosomes (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The TE paper seems to be &quot;submitted&quot; whereas the deletion mapping is &quot;in preparation&quot;. I suggest that the deletion mapping be incorporated into this manuscript. Since this manuscript is somewhat wordy and speculative, it would not be difficult to tighten up the writing (shorten the manuscript) to make room for the deletion data, which is in fact already present except perhaps for an additional Table and/or Figure, and a paragraph in Materials and methods. This need not preclude a more detailed second paper on the subject. As for the transposable element annotation, I hope it can be published back-to-back with this manuscript. It would be even better (but probably not possible) to present at least the main results in the present manuscript, to gain a comprehensive overview of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> germline chromosomes including not only CBS but also TE annotations.</p><p>16) The subsection &quot;Scrambled Macronuclear Chromosome-Destined DNA&quot; is weak. The word &quot;scrambled&quot; is misleading as the proposed mechanism (HR between repeats) is different than Oxytricha's use of a maternal guide RNA for unscrambling MDSs. The comparison with V(D)J joining is misleading, since that process involves the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway and not HR. Finally, this is based on MAC DNA from a single karyonide followed by isolation of a single fully assorted vegetative clone, isn't it? How can such a rare occurrence process be validated without looking at DNA from independently rearranged and assorted lines?</p><p>17) How are IESs identified? Are they just operationally defined as regions in the MIC assembly that are deleted in the MAC assembly? Are there other criteria? It is mentioned in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “MIC Centromeres” that &quot;we have characterized thousands of MIC-specific IESs&quot;. What is the characterization, just identification based on sequence alignment? Or is this a reference to data in the separate TE manuscript? I could not find anything in Materials and methods.</p><p>18) To avoid confusion, I think it should be made much clearer that IES in Paramecium are numerous, short, unique copy non-coding sequences (transposon remnants in many cases) while IES in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> are (or include) the transposable elements and other repeated sequences (as clearly stated in the subsection “MIC Centromeres”). This should be made clear in the second paragraph of the Introduction (and why 40,000 instead of the published 45,000 Paramecium IESs?).</p><p>19) Since MIC and MAC telomere repeats are different, and the exact numbers of MIC and MAC chromosomes are known, could telomere repeat abundance (and Cbs abundance?) in the reads allow an estimate of MAC contamination (subsection “MIC Centromeres”, last paragraph)? If the MIC telomere repeats and previously characterized sub-telomeric regions can be identified in read pairs (in both short insert and jumping libraries), could they be mapped to the MIC scaffolds (subsection “Building and Analysis of Chromosome-Length MIC Super-Assemblies”, last paragraph)? With only 10 MIC chromosome ends (but 169X coverage), this might be difficult.</p><p>20) In the first sentence of the subsection “MIC Genome Sequencing and Assembly”, &quot;highly AT-rich&quot;: can you provide the values for the MAC and MIC assemblies (77.7% and, 76.3%) or an average (~ 77%) in parentheses?</p><p>21) In the last sentence of the subsection “MIC Genome Sequencing and Assembly”, there is a typo (&quot;as will <italic>be</italic> described&quot;). More important, this sentence is not really justified, since only a small part of the Paramecium germline-limited sequences have been annotated and published to date. I don't see how a global comparison can be made, and it furthermore is made in the separate TE paper. That the organisation is different has been known for a long time, from molecular studies of the genome rearrangements.</p><p>22) In the sixth paragraph of the subsection “MIC Centromeres”. The suggestion that Paramecium MAC chromosomes are MIC chromosome arms was highly speculative when published in 2008, based on indirect evidence, namely an inverse correlation between G+C content and MAC chromosome length. It was suggested that this inverse correlation could be accounted for by biased gene conversion, indicating that MAC chromosomes could be proportional in size to MIC chromosome arms (since the MIC chromosomes are the ones undergoing meiotic recombination). More recently, work on Paramecium centromeres was published, so it would be wise to remove the speculative statement and refer only to the centromere paper. Moreover, I think that it is too soon to say that there is a fundamental difference in germline chromosome architecture at least as concerns centromeres, since it may turn out that centromeres are lost through each organism's usual IES elimination process.</p><p>23) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Sequence logo. The Cbs logo does not present the frequency of each base, as stated in the legend. The logo is presented in the form of bits of information. However, this has not been calculated correctly. No A or T can carry 2 bits of information in a genome that is over75% A+T. The logo should be calculated taking into account the frequency of each base in the genome, instead of assuming equal frequencies. This will make the C's stand out a lot more. There is a &quot;base frequency&quot; view available using seqlogo, but the result is not as pretty.</p><p>24) In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Conservation of chromosome breakage sites across <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> species”. I presume the term &quot;centric chromosomes&quot; refers to MAC chromosomes that come from centric regions of the MIC chromosomes. The text would be easier to follow if they are called centric MAC chromosomes. At the end of the same paragraph, is &quot;decoupling&quot; correct or should it be &quot;uncoupling&quot;?</p><p>25) Reference Lhuillier-Akakpo et al., 2015 is incomplete.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19090.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The manuscript has some remaining issues that need to be addressed before it would be considered as accepted, as outlined below.

However, the most interesting conclusion from the latter analysis is the conservation of Cbs locations, resulting in conservation of size and gene content of MAC chromosomes.

Publishing our analysis of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> IES sequences back-to-back with the current manuscript, as suggested by the reviewer, was our original intent. The <italic>eLife</italic> editors decided not to fully review the IES manuscript, as originally submitted, but offered the option of moving “key results” into the first manuscript. Initially, we decided to move forward with full submission of the first manuscript, but after reading the reviews and consulting with Reviewing Editor Kathleen Collins, we decided to take the original advice and move key results on IES analysis into a comprehensive (but substantially condensed and thoroughly reorganized) manuscript on genome structure and rearrangement. The second suggestion was to incorporate the chromosomal deletion mapping data into this manuscript. The deletion mapping study has been a multi-year effort led Dr. Donna Cassidy-Hanley and involving many undergraduate researchers. Only a small subset of the deletions identified were informative about centromere locations. We are concerned that full publication of the methods and partial results from this effort would compromise the ability of Dr. Cassidy-Hanley and colleagues to publish the full story in a high quality journal and receive the attention and exposure that this story deserves. We do not feel that the omission of these detailed results detracts from our manuscript. However, we have included a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> showing how a set of deletions were used to delimit the centromere region of Chromosome 5. The other centromeres were delimited in a similar fashion. We feel that this figure clarifies how the deletion analysis was performed, without compromising future publication of the entire study.</p><p><italic>16) The subsection &quot;Scrambled Macronuclear Chromosome-Destined DNA&quot; is weak.

How can such a rare occurrence process be validated without looking at DNA from independently rearranged and assorted lines?</italic> </p><p>See our response to point #2.</p><p><italic>17) How are IESs identified? Are they just operationally defined as regions in the MIC assembly that are deleted in the MAC assembly? Are there other criteria? It is mentioned in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “MIC Centromeres” that &quot;we have characterized thousands of MIC-specific IESs&quot;. What is the characterization, just identification based on sequence alignment? Or is this a reference to data in the separate TE manuscript? I could not find anything in Materials and methods.</italic> </p><p>This information is now included. See our response to point #15.</p><p><italic>18) To avoid confusion, I think it should be made much clearer that IES in Paramecium are numerous, short, unique copy non-coding sequences (transposon remnants in many cases) while IES in Tetrahymena are (or include) the transposable elements and other repeated sequences (as clearly stated in the subsection “MIC Centromeres”). This should be made clear in the second paragraph of the Introduction (and why 40,000 instead of the published 45,000 Paramecium IESs?).</italic> </p><p>The suggested corrections have been made.</p><p><italic>19) Since MIC and MAC telomere repeats are different, and the exact numbers of MIC and MAC chromosomes are known, could telomere repeat abundance (and Cbs abundance?) in the reads allow an estimate of MAC contamination (subsection “MIC Centromeres”, last paragraph)? If the MIC telomere repeats and previously characterized sub-telomeric regions can be identified in read pairs (in both short insert and jumping libraries), could they be mapped to the MIC scaffolds (subsection “Building and Analysis of Chromosome-Length MIC Super-Assemblies”, last paragraph)? With only 10 MIC chromosome ends (but 169X coverage), this might be difficult.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the suggestion of the reviewer to estimate the degree of MAC contamination by comparisons of MAC and MIC telomere repeats and to attempt to identify and link MIC telomeres to other scaffolds. We searched for MIC telomere repeats in the assemblies and reads, but unfortunately found few examples, and these uninformative. We have added text to the relevant section (Materials and methods in response to point #1) clarifying this issue. In any case, we do not feel that an estimate of MAC contamination would significantly add to or modify our conclusions. We clearly acknowledge that some contamination exists, which is unavoidable given experimental constraints, but as stated in the first paragraph of the Materials and methods, “By microscopic counting of purified nuclei (taking into account the relative nuclear ploidy), we estimate that contamination with macronuclear genomic DNA was less than 2%”. We are confident that this contamination did not significantly affect MIC genome assembly in any way that would affect the conclusions of this paper. Therefore, the text identified by the reviewer has been modified to explain the poor assembly of telomeric regions as being the result of their repetitive nature, as observed in the genome assemblies of many other organisms.</p><p><italic>20) In the first sentence of the subsection “MIC Genome Sequencing and Assembly”, &quot;highly AT-rich&quot;: can you provide the values for the MAC and MIC assemblies (77.7% and, 76.3%) or an average (~ 77%) in parentheses?</italic> </p><p>These values (MAC assembly 77.7% and MIC assembly 77.9%) have been added to the relevant section of the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>21) In the last sentence of the subsection “MIC Genome Sequencing and Assembly”, there is a typo (&quot;as will be described&quot;). More important, this sentence is not really justified, since only a small part of the Paramecium germline-limited sequences have been annotated and published to date. I don't see how a global comparison can be made, and it furthermore is made in the separate TE paper. That the organisation is different has been known for a long time, from molecular studies of the genome rearrangements.</italic> </p><p>The text in question has been removed.</p><p><italic>22) In the sixth paragraph of the subsection “MIC Centromeres”. The suggestion that Paramecium MAC chromosomes are MIC chromosome arms was highly speculative when published in 2008, based on indirect evidence, namely an inverse correlation between G+C content and MAC chromosome length. It was suggested that this inverse correlation could be accounted for by biased gene conversion, indicating that MAC chromosomes could be proportional in size to MIC chromosome arms (since the MIC chromosomes are the ones undergoing meiotic recombination). More recently, work on Paramecium centromeres was published, so it would be wise to remove the speculative statement and refer only to the centromere paper. Moreover, I think that it is too soon to say that there is a fundamental difference in germline chromosome architecture at least as concerns centromeres, since it may turn out that centromeres are lost through each organism's usual IES elimination process.</italic> </p><p>We have modified the text to remove the speculative statement concerning <italic>Paramecium</italic> centromeres as well as the assertion of a “fundamental difference” between the centromeres of the two species and include reference to the recently published study, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>23) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Sequence logo. The Cbs logo does not present the frequency of each base, as stated in the legend. The logo is presented in the form of bits of information. However, this has not been calculated correctly. No A or T can carry 2 bits of information in a genome that is over75% A+T. The logo should be calculated taking into account the frequency of each base in the genome, instead of assuming equal frequencies. This will make the C's stand out a lot more. There is a &quot;base frequency&quot; view available using seqlogo, but the result is not as pretty.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for catching the mistake in the figure legend; it has been corrected to identify the y-axis as bits, that is, as conservation units rather than nucleotide frequency units. Regarding the suggestion to raise the baseline to the level of the genome-wide conservation level, which is what the reviewer suggests, there is some merit to the suggestion. But the genome-wide frequencies (and associated bits of conservation) include coding sequence frequencies that have higher than average G+C content. Retaining the true conservation level of the non-coding Cbs-adjacent sequence provides a meaningful internal control. We prefer to retain the presentation of the conservation measurements in an assumption-free way, which does not, for example, give a distorted view of the difference in conservation between the T’s at Cbs position 1 and 15.</p><p><italic>24) In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Conservation of chromosome breakage sites across Tetrahymena species”. I presume the term &quot;centric chromosomes&quot; refers to MAC chromosomes that come from centric regions of the MIC chromosomes. The text would be easier to follow if they are called centric MAC chromosomes. At the end of the same paragraph, is &quot;decoupling&quot; correct or should it be &quot;uncoupling&quot;?</italic> </p><p>Following revision, the term &quot;centric chromosomes&quot; no longer appears in the main text, but it has been replaced with &quot;centric MAC chromosomes&quot; in the legend to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. In the legend to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>, we also now refer to &quot;Centric MAC chromosomes, derived from the centromeric regions of MIC chromosomes&quot;. The suggested change from &quot;decoupling&quot; to &quot;uncoupling&quot; has been made. This sentence now appears in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2C</xref>.</p><p><italic>25) Reference Lhuillier-Akakpo et al., 2015 is incomplete.</italic> </p><p>The reference has been corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
