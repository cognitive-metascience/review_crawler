Here, we identified an atypical protease of the subtilase family [SBT5.2(b)] that attenuates the transcriptional activation of plant defence independently of its protease activity. The <italic>SBT5.2</italic> gene produces two distinct transcripts encoding a canonical secreted subtilase [SBT5.2(a)] and an intracellular protein [SBT5.2(b)]. Concomitant to <italic>SBT5.2(a)</italic> downregulation, <italic>SBT5.2(b)</italic> expression is induced after bacterial inoculation. SBT5.2(b) localizes to endosomes where it interacts with and retains the defence-related transcription factor MYB30. Nuclear exclusion of MYB30 results in its reduced transcriptional activation and, thus, suppressed resistance. <italic>sbt5.2</italic> mutants, with abolished <italic>SBT5.2(a)</italic> and <italic>SBT5.2(b)</italic> expression, display enhanced defence that is suppressed in a <italic>myb30</italic> mutant background. Moreover, overexpression of SBT5.2(b), but not SBT5.2(a), in <italic>sbt5.2</italic> plants reverts the phenotypes displayed by <italic>sbt5.2</italic> mutants. Overall, we uncover a regulatory mode of the transcriptional activation of defence responses previously undescribed in eukaryotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19755.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19755.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19755.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Like animals, plants have evolved numerous ways to protect themselves from disease. When a plant detects an invading microbe, it massively changes which genes it expresses to establish a defensive response. This is possible thanks to the action of a type of protein, named transcription factors, which are able to bind to DNA in the cell nucleus and regulate gene expression. However, triggering such a response comes at a cost, and so plants must keep their defensive response in check such that they can allocate resources in a balanced way.</p><p>In the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a protein named MYB30 is one transcription factor that is able to promote disease resistance. Previous research identified some proteins that can reduce the activity of this transcription factor to avoid triggering a response when it is not needed, for example, when no infectious microbes are present. However, it was likely that other proteins were also involved in the process.</p><p>Now, Serrano et al. report that an enzyme called SBT5.2 is an additional negative regulator of MYB30 activity. SBT5.2 belongs to a family of protein-degrading enzymes called subtilases, which are typically localized outside cells. As such, it was unclear how SBT5.2 could interact and regulate a transcription factor that is found inside the nucleus of plant cells.</p><p>Nevertheless, Serrano et al. found that the gene that encodes SBT5.2 actually gives rise to two distinct proteins. The first is a classical subtilase that is indeed located outside of the cell, and so cannot interact with MYB30 and does not affect its activity. The second protein is an atypical subtilase that localises to bubble-like compartments called vesicles within the cell and is able to highjack MYB30 on its way to the nucleus. When the atypical subtilase interacts with MYB30 at vesicles, it stops MYB30 from entering the nucleus. As a result, MYB30 cannot bind to the DNA nor activate its target genes. This means that the defensive response that normally depends on MYB30 is weakened.</p><p>The work of Serrano et al. uncovers a new way to regulate the expression of defence-related genes. Further unravelling the molecular mechanisms involved in the fine-tuning of gene expression represents a challenging task for future research.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19755.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19755.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>plant defence</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>subtilase</kwd><kwd>hypersensitive response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serrano</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AgreenSkills fellowship, EU Marie-Curie FP7 COFUND People Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant agreement n° 267196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serrano</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Freach Ministry of National Education and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buscaill</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>French Laboratory of Excellence project 'TULIP'</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-41</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rivas</surname><given-names>Susana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>French Laboratory of Excellence project 'TULIP'</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-IDEX-0002-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rivas</surname><given-names>Susana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An atypical subtilase protein, resulting from an alternative splicing event, mediates retention of the defence related-transcription factor MYB30 at endosomal vesicles, thus repressing Arabidopsis antibacterial immunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulation of protein turnover plays a central role in the proper functioning of eukaryotic cells. Indeed, proteases of different families have been shown to be involved in the control of metabolism, physiology, growth and adaptive responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Hoorn, 2008</xref>). Subtilisin-like proteases (subtilases) are serine proteases featuring a catalytic triad characterized by the three amino acids aspartate, histidine and serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodson and Wlodawer, 1998</xref>). According to the MEROPS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://merops.sanger.ac.uk">http://merops.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>) classification, subtilases belong to the S8 family within the SB clan of serine proteases and are grouped into two subfamilies, subtilisins (S8A) and kexins (S8B). Nine subtilases have been characterized in mammals, seven of which belong to the kexin group and two others to the S8A subfamily (pyrolysins). With no representatives of the kexin type, plant subtilases exclusively belong to the pyrolysin group within the S8A subfamily. Pyrolysin-related subtilase families are largely expanded throughout the plant kingdom with a degree of complexity that exceeds that of their mammalian counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaller et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> the subtilase family comprises 56 members distributed in six distinct subgroups (SBT1-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rautengarten et al., 2005</xref>). Despite their prevalence, our knowledge of the function of plant subtilases is rather poor. Subtilases are predicted to be secreted and have been involved in general protein turnover as well as in the highly specific regulation of plant development or responses to environmental changes and, more recently, in suppression of basal immunity and immune priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Figueiredo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>As sessile organisms, plants must face the diversity of pathogens that they encounter in their habitat. Plants, unlike mammals, lack mobile defender cells and a somatic adaptive immune system. Instead, they rely on the innate immunity of each cell and on systemic signals originating from infection sites. Plant resistance to disease is a costly response, closely connected to plant physiological and developmental processes, and often associated with the so-called hypersensitive response (HR), a form of programmed cell death that develops at attempted infection sites, allegedly to prevent pathogen propagation through the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coll et al., 2011</xref>). The sharp limit of the HR suggests the existence of tight regulatory mechanisms to restrict cell death development to the inoculated zone although the molecular actors involved in this process remain unknown for the most part. In line with the high cellular cost of triggering defence and cell death-associated responses, negative regulatory mechanisms are used by the plant to attenuate the activation of immune-related functions and allow a balanced allocation of resources upon pathogen challenge.</p><p>Transcriptional reprogramming of the plant cell is a crucial step that allows mounting of efficient defence responses after pathogen attack. Transcription factors (TFs) and co-regulatory proteins play essential roles in launching and regulating the transcriptional changes that direct the plant defence response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buscaill and Rivas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsuda and Somssich, 2015</xref>). MYB TFs of the R2R3 type (126 members in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) mostly regulate plant-specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubos et al., 2010</xref>). Among the MYB TFs regulating defence-related transcription, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MYB30 is one of the best characterized. MYB30 promotes defence and cell death-associated responses through the transcriptional activation of genes related to the lipid biosynthesis pathway that leads to the production of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raffaele et al., 2008</xref>). MYB30 is targeted by the effector protein XopD, from the bacterial pathogen <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris (Xcc</italic>), leading to suppression of MYB30-mediated transcriptional activation of plant resistance and thus underlining the important role played by MYB30 in plant defence regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canonne et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A previously performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen using MYB30 as bait identified a secretory phospholipase (<italic>At</italic>sPLA<sub>2</sub>-α) and a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase (MIEL1) that exert negative spatial and temporal control on MYB30 transcriptional activity through distinct molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Froidure et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marino et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we describe SBT5.2, a serine protease of the subtilisin group, as a new MYB30-interacting partner. We demonstrate that the <italic>SBT5.2</italic> transcript is alternatively spliced and that one of the two <italic>SBT5.2</italic> splice variants, SBT5.2(b), whose expression pattern follows that of <italic>MYB30</italic> after bacterial treatment, encodes an atypical subtilase that specifically mediates retention of MYB30 at endosomal vesicles. This phenomenon is independent of the integrity of the SBT5.2(b) catalytic triad, requires N-terminal myristoylation of SBT5.2(b) and results in attenuation of MYB30-mediated HR. Our work uncovers a novel regulatory mode for a subtilase protein and underlines the intricacy of the transcriptional regulation of plant responses to pathogen attack.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of SBT5.2</title><p>In order to search for components involved in MYB30-mediated signalling, a Y2H screen was previously conducted using a MYB30 version deleted from its transcriptional activation domain (MYB30ΔAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Froidure et al., 2010</xref>) as bait.

Except for their N-terminal differences, the two corresponding encoded proteins are predicted to be identical and contain a catalytic triad with three amino acids (D145, H210 and S546 in SBT5.2(a), and D106, H171 and S507 in SBT5.2(b)) conserved within serine proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SBT5.2(a) is a secreted protein whereas SBT5.2(b) is intracellular</title><p>Alternative splicing (AS) of <italic>SBT5.2</italic> may have important implications for the subcellular localization and function of the proteins encoded by the two transcripts. The presence of a SP and a PD in SBT5.2(a) suggests that this protein may enter the secretory pathway and be secreted to the extracellular space. Indeed, secretion of SBT5.2(a) was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engineer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaschani et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, the absence of the SP in SBT5.2(b) may prevent secretion of the protein. In order to test this possibility, the subcellular localization of the two proteins was first investigated using <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transient expression of RFP-tagged SBT5.2(a) and SBT5.2(b) under the control of a dexamethasone- (Dex-) inducible promoter in leaf epidermal cells of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>.

In order to control the detection of intracellular proteins in the IF, the intracellular protein MIEL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marino et al., 2013</xref>) was co-expressed with SBT5.2 proteins. As expected for an intracellular protein, MIEL1 was detected in the total extract fraction (TE) and not in the IF, confirming that the IF fraction did not contain intracellular proteins due to unintentional cellular lysis during IF isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). SBT5.2(a) was detected in the IF as two protein bands that may correspond to the processed and unprocessed forms of the protease, whereas SBT5.2(b) was exclusively detected in the TE and never in the IF fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).

The physical interaction between SBT5.2(b) and MYB30 was investigated in FRET-FLIM assays using GFP- (donor) and RFP- (acceptor) tagged MYB30 and SBT5.2(b), respectively. In order to avoid potential changes in GFP lifetime due to differences in the molecular environments of two distinct subcellular compartments [MYB30 being nuclear when expressed alone or in vesicle-like structures when co-expressed with SBT5.2(b)], the subcellular localization of GFP-tagged MYB30 when co-expressed with non-fluorescent HA-tagged, or an untagged version of SBT5.2(b), was therefore investigated.

In order to further test this idea, an N-terminal deletion of SBT5.2(b) was generated [SBT5.2(b)<sup>162-730</sup>]. RFP-tagged SBT5.2(b)<sup>162-730</sup> indeed localized to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Furthermore, an N-terminally tagged RFP fusion of SBT5.2(b) also presented a cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), suggesting that a free SBT5.2(b)N-terminus is necessary for SBT5.2(b) endosomal targeting. Close inspection of the SBT5.2(b)N-terminal region uncovered the presence of a putative myristoylation site (M<underline>G</underline>SASSA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). A SBT5.2(b) version in which the putatively myristoylated Gly2 residue was mutated to Ala [SBT5.2(b)<sup>G2A</sup>] also localized to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), confirming the importance of N-myristoylation for SBT5.2(b) endosomal targeting. Finally, co-expression of SBT5.2(b)<sup>162-730</sup>-RFP, RFP-SBT5.2(b) or SBT5.2(b)<sup>G2A</sup> RFP with GFP-MYB30 did not affect MYB30 nuclear targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Interestingly, MYB30 accumulation in the cytoplasm was enhanced in the presence of these SBT5.2(b) versions, consistent with the presence in the three proteins of an intact SBT5.2 C-terminal domain that mediates the interaction with MYB30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). An HA-tagged SBT5.2(b)<sup>G2A</sup> version induced the same effect confirming that the enhanced detection of GFP-MYB30 in the cytoplasm is not an artefact due the presence of a second fluorophore. Together, our data strongly suggest that a free N-terminal myristoylated residue is responsible of SBT5.2(b) targeting to the endosomes and of MYB30 retention in endosomal vesicles.</p><p>In order to further characterize the simultaneous localization of SBT5.2(b) to both early and late endosomes, HA-tagged versions of either SBT5.2(a), SBT5.2(b) or SBT5.2(b)<sup>G2A</sup> were co-expressed with both GFP-tagged VHA-a1 and RFP-tagged ARA6. When expressed with SBT5.2(a), both subcellular markers conserved their distinct subcellular localization in TGN/EE and LE/MVB, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, co-expression with SBT5.2(b) led to co-localization of VHA-a1 and ARA6 in the same endosomal compartment, strongly suggesting that SBT5.2(b) is able to interfere with endosomal trafficking. Myristoylation of SBT5.2(b) appears to be essential to this effect, since expression of SBT5.2(b)<sup>G2A</sup> did not affect the discrete endosomal populations tagged by VHA-a1 or ARA6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19755.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>SBT5.2(b) leads to the formation of hybrid endosomal compartments in a myristoylation-dependent manner.</title><p>Confocal images of epidermal <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cells 36 hr after <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transient expression of the indicated constructs.

Moreover, AS plays crucial functions in eukaryotic cells, as it determines the binding properties, intracellular localisation, enzymatic activity, protein stability and posttranslational modifications of a large number of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stamm et al., 2005</xref>). In humans, the importance of AS is clearly highlighted by the fact that about 15% of genetic hereditary diseases are caused by mutations that affect splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kornblihtt et al., 2013</xref>). In plants, AS plays fundamental roles in regulating plant growth, development, and responses to environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Staiger and Brown, 2013</xref>). A genome-wide transcriptomic analysis in Arabidopsis plants inoculated with bacteria uncovered a surprisingly large number of AS events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howard et al., 2013</xref>). Although we are still far from understanding the functional implications of this transcriptome complexity, the function of numerous plant resistance genes, encoding immune receptors, appears to be regulated by AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gassmann, 2008</xref>). To our knowledge, our work represents the first described example of AS affecting the function of a protein of the subtilase family. AS of <italic>SBT5.2</italic> results in the production of the atypical subtilase SBT5.2(b), uncovering a novel mode of regulation of defence reactions and contributing to further our understanding of the varied roles of AS in the control of plant immunity.</p><p>Following bacterial inoculation, the respective induction and repression of <italic>SBT5.2(b)</italic> and <italic>SBT5.2(a)</italic> expression suggests a functional role for SBT5.2(b) during defence regulation. This idea is reinforced by the observed co-regulation of <italic>SBT5.2(b)</italic> and <italic>MYB30</italic> expression after bacterial treatment. Despite their pervasiveness, our current understanding of the functions of plants subtilases is still limited. Different studies suggest a role in both general protein turnover and regulation of plant development or responses to environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Figueiredo et al., 2014</xref>). The first example of a plant subtilase potentially acting during plant-pathogen interactions was reported in tomato, where the expression of the subtilases <italic>P69B</italic> and <italic>P69C</italic> was induced by pathogen infection and treatment with salycilic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jordá et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tornero et al., 1997</xref>). More recently, the Arabidopsis subtilase SBT3.3 was found to be involved in the regulation of immune signalling through chromatin remodelling of defence-related genes associated with the activation of immune priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramírez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Plant subtilases are usually synthesized in the form of preproprotein precursors, translocated <italic>via</italic> an N-terminal ER-targeting SP into the endomembrane system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaller et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, using mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cedzich et al., 2009</xref>) and structural analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murayama et al., 2012</xref>), plant subtilases were shown to be glycosylated in the secretory pathway and to accumulate extracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaller et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement with the preproprotein structure, the maturation of the active enzyme from its inactive precursor requires at least two processing steps. After cleavage of the SP, subtilases are ultimately activated by cleavage of the PD producing the mature active enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>). Processing of the PD, an auto-inhibitor domain of plant subtilases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakagawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>), is an intramolecular autocatalytic reaction that occurs late in the ER or in the early Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cedzich et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we show that AS of the <italic>SBT5.2</italic> gene has important implications for the subcellular localization and activity of the resulting isoforms, despite the nearly total conservation between the two protein sequences. Consistent with harbouring all canonical features of a subtilase, we confirmed that SBT5.2(a) enters the secretory pathway, where it is glycosylated, and is secreted to the extracellular space as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engineer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaschani et al., 2012</xref>). SBT5.2 was previously described as a negative regulator of stomatal density under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions through cleavage of the extracellular pro-peptide ligand EPF2 in the apoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engineer et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, in agreement with its lacking a SP and the first five amino acids of the PD, SBT5.2(b) does not enter the secretory pathway, its PD is thus not cleaved and may fold onto SBT5.2(b) catalytic domain inhibiting its protease activity. Indeed, despite the presence of PGSs and catalytic residues, we were unable to detect SBT5.2(b) glycosylation or protease activity. We also showed that MYB30 accumulation <italic>in planta</italic> is not affected by SBT5.2(a) or SB5.2(b), indicating that these proteins do not proteolytically cleave the TF. In the case of catalytically active SBT5.2(a), this can be explained by the lack of co-localization of both proteins. Despite their subcellular co-localization and physical interaction, lack of modification of MYB30 accumulation in the presence of SBT5.2(b) is consistent with SBT5.2(b) being inactive as a protease, as underlined by the finding that both wild-type SBT5.2(b) and catalytic mutant SBT5.2(b)<sup>H171A</sup> are able to interact with and retain MYB30 at endosomal vesicles. These results suggest an alternative mode of action of SBT5.2(b) on MYB30 activity, likely related to SBT5.2(b)-mediated MYB30 nuclear exclusion. Examples of proteases playing proteolysis-independent functions have been described in mammals. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a major regulatory role in cholesterol homeostasis but does not require its catalytic activity to induce degradation of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McNutt et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, γ-secretase, an aspartyl protease that performs the final proteolytic cleavage step in the processing cascade of the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vassar et al., 1999</xref>), displays proteolysis-independent functions during the regulation of βAPP maturation and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wrigley et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>SBT5.2(b) localises to both early and late endosomal compartments and this requires N-terminal myristoylation of the protein. Since co-expression of SBT5.2(b), but not SBT5.2(a), with both early and late endosome markers leads to colocalisation of both markers, it is tempting to speculate that SBT5.2(b) is able to interfere with endosomal trafficking leading to the formation of hybrid endosomes. In mammals, expression of constitutively active Rab5 blocks the conversion of early to late endosomes, giving rise to hybrid endosomal compartments and deregulation of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rink et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, overexpression of Arabidopsis sorting nexin SNX2b leads to the formation of large SNX2-containing endosome aggregations, which inhibits vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Phan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>SBT5.2(b)-mediated regulation of MYB30 activity supports the emerging idea that endosomal trafficking pathways are not only central regulators of plasma membrane protein homeostasis but also control multiple signalling pathways, including those involved in plant disease resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reyes et al., 2011</xref>). Enhanced susceptibility of plants impaired in regulators of endosome trafficking emphasizes the importance of endocytic processes in establishing defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, plasma membrane receptors that sense apoplastic microbes are immune-related cargos of plant trafficking pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben Khaled et al., 2015</xref>), and a number of intracellular immune receptors have been shown to constitutively localize to endomembranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takemoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhardt et al., 2012</xref>), further underlining the prominent role of endomembrane systems in determining plant resistance. Although the role of endosomes in implementing defence signalling is not yet well understood, they have been proposed as central subcellular sites for orchestration of the HR. Indeed, relocalisation of the potato resistance protein R3a from the cytoplasm to endosomal compartments is required to trigger the HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhardt et al., 2012</xref>). The importance of these compartments during immunity is further underlined by the fact that both plant and animal pathogens produce inhibitory effector proteins that specifically target endomembrane trafficking. For example, the Arabidopsis ADP ribosylation factor (ARF)-Guanine exchange factor (GEF) MIN7 is targeted and degraded by the bacterial effector HopM1 altering secretory trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nomura et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2011</xref>). In mammalian cells, the effector PipB2 from the bacterial pathogen <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> causes a specific redistribution of late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/Lys) compartments to the cell periphery promoting formation of <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments (Sifs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knodler and Steele-Mortimer, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that SBT5.2(b) mediates MYB30 nuclear exclusion resulting in attenuation of MYB30 gene expression and HR, is in agreement with several reports describing controlled nuclear localisation as an efficient mechanism to regulate TF activity in eukaryotic cells. Subcellular compartmentalization of the E2F TF family, either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm, is used to control cell cycle in differentiated skeletal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill and Hamel, 2000</xref>). p53, a tightly regulated animal TF that acts as a hub for numerous signalling pathways including apoptosis, shifts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in the presence of HDM2, where it has important roles that are independent of its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Green and Kroemer, 2009</xref>). Similarly, alternative functions for MYB30 in endosomal vesicles, other than HR regulation, cannot be excluded at this stage. In addition, nuclear import of 'dormant' TFs plays important roles in the regulation of gene expression. Upon exposure to environmental stresses, several membrane-bound TFs have been shown to be proteolytically activated by either ubiquitin-mediated proteasome activities or by specific membrane-bound proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoppe et al., 2001</xref>), which may facilitate triggering quick transcriptional responses to ensure plant survival under stressful conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seo et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, subtilases are known to be involved in the release of 'dormant' membrane-bound TFs. Arabidopsis SBT6.1 is able to cleave the ER-located TF bZIP17 that, once released, moves to the nucleus to activate transcription in response to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, nuclear exclusion by localization to small vesicle-like structures has been reported as a negative regulatory mechanism of TF activity. Indeed, the small interference protein MIF1, promotes nuclear exclusion of the TF ZHD5 that regulates flower architecture and leaf development. As a result, ZHD5 is relocalised into cytoplasmic vesicle-like structures, which interferes with is transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>During the last few years, different regulatory mechanisms of MYB30-mediated HR have been uncovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raffaele and Rivas, 2013</xref>), including spatio-temporal control of MYB30 activity through the action of the secreted phospholipase AtsPLA<sub>2</sub>-α (that specifically relocalises to the nucleus in the presence of MYB30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Froidure et al., 2010</xref>]) and the RING-type E3 ligase MIEL1 (that ubiquitinates MYB30 and leads to its proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marino et al., 2013</xref>]). SBT5.2(b)-mediated nuclear exclusion of MYB30 represents an additional regulatory mode of the activity of this TF, underlining the complexity of the regulatory modes of defence-related plant cell death responses. This intricate regulation of MYB30 is reminiscent of the tight control exerted on animal TFs such as p53 that is also multi-regulated through varied modes including protein-protein interactions, ubiquitination and, notably, nuclear exclusion. This sophisticated fine-tuning, which provides an efficient means to regulate fundamental cellular processes, appears as a general feature underlying the transcriptional control in eukaryotic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning procedures</title><p>Plasmids used in this study were constructed by Gateway technology (GW; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) following the instructions of the manufacturer.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A non canonical subtilase attenuates the transcriptional activation of defence responses in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor and three reviewers: Andreas Schaller (Reviewer #2), Marty Dickman (Reviewer #3), and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Rivas and coworkers show that the subtilisin-like protease SBT5.2 is a negative regulator of defense in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and that it acts through repression of MYB30 transcriptional activity. They further show that there are two splice variants, SBT5.2(a) which represents the canonical secreted subtilase, and SBT5.2(b) which lacks a signal peptide and thus fails to be secreted. SBT5.2(b) is targeted to enodosomes by N-terminal myristoylation. It interacts with MYB30 via its C-terminal domain, sequestering the transcription factor in the cytosol thus preventing nuclear localization and activation of defense. These findings are novel and highly relevant. They provide important insight into the function of subtilases and reveal a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a thorough and comprehensive study. The paper is well written and the work is rigorously performed. Most of the conclusions are supported by multiple lines of evidence. Experiments are generally well-controlled and data appear solid.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Note that the reviewers did not find major flaws with the paper but did raise a number of more minor comments that the authors will need to address. These are listed below.</p><p>Please clarify the following, which the reviewers found either confusing or misleading:</p><p>1) The prodomain serves as an intramolecular inhibitor and keeps SBTs inactive until it is cleaved and released from the enzyme. Because SBT5.2(b) still has its prodomain, I would expect it to be inactive. This should be clarified in the text in case not all readers are specialists in this area.</p><p>2) There was a general concern about studies of protein activity based strictly on crude extracts that might, for example, contain inhibitors that could modulate activity, separate from that intrinsic to a purified protein. The authors need to address this concern and, at least, provide some caveats for their claims based on these experiments.</p><p>3) Continuing with this concern, with respect to the suitability of the activity assay, the reviews raised concerns about the use of crude extracts on a universal protease substrate, resulting in high background activity. There is an increase of only 10% in protoplasts expressing SBT5.2(a). There were doubts about whether this assay is really suitable for extracellular proteins. Secreted proteins would likely be diluted in the medium and lost when lysed protoplasts are used for the activity assay.</p><p>4) Is expression of SBT5.2(b) upregulated in the <italic>myb30</italic> mutant background? The authors seem to imply that this gene is under MYB30 control.</p><p>5) The authors need to confirm that their prediction of higher MYB30 levels in the <italic>sbt5.2</italic> mutant plants is indeed occurring.</p><p>6) It is known that only the processed form of SBTs is secreted, the precursor is not. Therefore, only the processed form is expected to be present in intercellular fluids (IF). However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> the SBT5.2(a) precursor is clearly detected in IF, and the ratio of band intensities for precursor and mature SBT5.2(a) appears to be the same in TE and in IF. This would argue for contamination with intracellular proteins.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, deglycosylation resulted in a mobility shift for both, the precursor and the mature protease. This observation raises doubts whether SBT5.2(a) is actually secreted, because during passage through the secretory pathway, the cleavable high-mannose precursors of N-linked glycans are modified. Plant-specific modifications include α(1,3)-fucosylation and β 1,2-xylosylation of the glycan core which renders them resistant to cleavage by EndoH and PNGase F (ref 1). Therefore, deglycosylation and the resulting mobility shift are only expected for the precursor that did pass through the Golgi yet. The mature protease, if secreted, would be expected to be EndoH and PNGase F resistant.</p><p>8) As an easy experiment to confirm secretion of the protease would suggest to include plasmolysis treatment in the transient expression experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19755.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The prodomain serves as an intramolecular inhibitor and keeps SBTs inactive until it is cleaved and released from the enzyme.

This should be clarified in the text in case not all readers are specialists in this area.</italic> </p><p>The notion of the prodomain as an intramolecular inhibitor of protease activity, which was previously discussed in the third paragraph of the Discussion, is now introduced earlier in the first section of Results.</p><p><italic>2) There was a general concern about studies of protein activity based strictly on crude extracts that might, for example, contain inhibitors that could modulate activity, separate from that intrinsic to a purified protein. The authors need to address this concern and, at least, provide some caveats for their claims based on these experiments.</italic> </p><p>Our first attempts to test SBT5.2(a) and (b) activity were indeed performed with purified proteins following immunoprecipitation from crude extracts. This protocol confirmed detection of increased fluorescence (indicative of protease activity) for SBT5.2(a), but not SBT5.2(a)<sup>H210A</sup>, SBT5.2(b), SBT5.2(b)<sup>H171A</sup>, as compared to empty vector. However, we failed to detect SBT5.2(b) proteins by Western blot after immunoprecipitation. Indeed, SBT5.2(b) is highly prone to degradation, likely due to lack of glycosylation (glycosylation has been described to play a role in protein stabilization and protection from degradation in both plant and animal cells). In contrast, glycosylated SBT5.2(a) is more stable both after protein extraction and in vivo (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although we modified the incubation time and temperature to try and reduce SBT5.2(b) degradation, we did not succeed in detecting SBT5.2(b) protein (or activity) after immunoprecipitation. Under these conditions, it was thus not possible to conclude whether lack of increased fluorescence was due to lack of SBT5.2(b) protease activity or just to the fact that the protein was absent owing to degradation during immunoprecipitation. We additionally tried to express and purify the proteins in bacteria but the subtilases were systematically found in inclusion bodies, which was not compatible with activity assays.</p><p>However, it is important to note that the goal of these assays was not to show the activity of SBT5.2(a), as this was previously demonstrated in two independent previous reports (Kaschani et al., 2012; Engineer et al., 2014), but to place ourselves in the best possible conditions to detect activity of SBT5.2(b). We therefore worked with total extracts which allowed the best preservation of the protein. However, even in these favorable conditions and in agreement with other biochemical evidences presented in the article, we were not able to detect SBT5.2(b) protease activity.</p><p><italic>3) Continuing with this concern, with respect to the suitability of the activity assay, the reviews raised concerns about the use of crude extracts on a universal protease substrate, resulting in high background activity. There is an increase of only 10% in protoplasts expressing SBT5.2(a). There were doubts about whether this assay is really suitable for extracellular proteins. Secreted proteins would likely be diluted in the medium and lost when lysed protoplasts are used for the activity assay.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the secreted protein is probably lost in the medium and not detectable in this assay. Therefore, the detected activity (and protein in the Western blot) most likely corresponds to the mature (active) SBT5.2(a) form that is about to be secreted but still intracellular. Although it is not possible to know the proportion of intracellular versus secreted SBT52(a), it appears to be high enough for detection of its activity. Indeed, 14% is not a high increase of activity as compared to background levels but SBT5.2(a) fluorescence levels were consistently found to be higher than those detected in SBT5.2(a)<sup>H210A</sup>, SBT5.2(b), SBT5.2(b)<sup>H171A</sup> or empty vector-expressing protoplasts, which confirms protease activity.</p><p>In any case, loss of secreted proteins in the extracellular medium should not be a problem for detection of activity of intracellular proteases such as SBT5.2(b), which as mentioned in the point above was the goal of these assays. We thus consider that this assay confirms lack of SBT5.2(b) activity.</p><p><italic>4) Is expression of SBT5.2(b) upregulated in the myb30 mutant background? The authors seem to imply that this gene is under MYB30 control.</italic> </p><p>We apologize if our text conveyed this idea. Indeed, we do not mean to imply that SBT5.2(b) expression is controlled by MYB30 but that expression of both genes follows a similar expressing pattern after bacterial inoculation. We have modified a sentence at the end of the Introduction to clarify this point.</p><p><italic>5) The authors need to confirm that their prediction of higher MYB30 levels in the sbt5.2 mutant plants is indeed occurring.</italic> </p><p>We are not sure to understand the reviewer’s comment. We do not expect higher MYB30 levels in the sbt5.2 mutant plants, as the regulation of MYB30 by SBT5.2(b) is independent of SBT5.2(b) catalytic activity and has no effect on MYB30 gene expression or protein accumulation levels but on its subcellular localization. By retaining MYB30 in endosomal vesicles, SBT5.2(b) impedes MYB30 nuclear entry and activation of its target genes.</p><p><italic>6) It is known that only the processed form of SBTs is secreted, the precursor is not. Therefore, only the processed form is expected to be present in intercellular fluids (IF). However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> the SBT5.2(a) precursor is clearly detected in IF, and the ratio of band intensities for precursor and mature SBT5.2(a) appears to be the same in TE and in IF. This would argue for contamination with intracellular proteins.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a surprising observation, since the general trend is the presence of the processed form in the IF. We do not think that this is due to contamination with intracellular proteins since we did not detect intracellular MIEL1 in these assays and systematically detected the slow migrating SBT5.2(a) band that we think may correspond to the unprocessed form of the protein. In addition, as you can see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>, the catalytic mutant SBT5.2(a)-H210A was also detected in the IF although this protein is unable to mediate its selfprocessing and is also slow migrating. Understanding this observation requires further investigation but is beyond the scope of this work, which is focused on SBT5.2(b)-mediated regulation of MYB30-dependent plant defence.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19755.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Western blot analysis of total protein extracts (TE) and intercellular fluids (IF) from <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves co-expressing HA-tagged intracellular MIEL1 with wild-type and catalytically mutant SBT5.2(<bold>a</bold>) proteins.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19755.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19755.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19755-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, deglycosylation resulted in a mobility shift for both, the precursor and the mature protease. This observation raises doubts whether SBT5.2(a) is actually secreted, because during passage through the secretory pathway, the cleavable high-mannose precursors of N-linked glycans are modified. Plant-specific modifications include α(1,3)-fucosylation and β 1,2-xylosylation of the glycan core which renders them resistant to cleavage by EndoH and PNGase F (ref 1). Therefore, deglycosylation and the resulting mobility shift are only expected for the precursor that did pass through the Golgi yet. The mature protease, if secreted, would be expected to be EndoH and PNGase F resistant.</italic> </p><p>We are sorry that we were not clear enough about this point in the previous version of the manuscript. We did not mean to convey the idea that deglycosylase treatment results in a mobility shift for both the processed and the unprocessed form of SBT5.2(a). In agreement with the reviewer’s comment, the mobility of the unprocessed band is increased after deglycosylation whereas the mobility of the processed form (that is expected to be resistant to EndoHand PNGaseF treatment) is not affected by deglycosylase treatment as expected. In order to fully clarify this point and better illustrate this idea, we have repeated the experiment using a longer time to run the gel and thus improve separation of the different bands. Please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> in which the fully processed form is indicated with an arrowhead.</p><p><italic>8) As an easy experiment to confirm secretion of the protease would suggest to include plasmolysis treatment in the transient expression experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</italic></p><p>In our view secretion of SBT5.2(a) has been clearly demonstrated. First, as mentioned in the text, SBT5.2(a) was first identified in an activity-based probe assay to display the activity of apoplastic serine hydrolases (Kaschani et al., 2012). Second, a cell-wall mass spectrometry analysis identified SBT5.2(a) as a CO<sub>2</sub>-induced extracellular protease (Engineer et al., 2014). Third, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> clearly shows accumulation of SBT5.2(a)-RFP in apoplastic spaces. To make this clearer for the reader, apoplastic spaces where SBT5.2(a)-RFP accumulates are indicated with arrowheads in the new version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. Fourth, further confirmation of the extracellular accumulation of SBT5.2(a) was obtained by isolation of IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Based on all these results, we do not consider it necessary to include an additional figure with a plasmolysis treatment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
