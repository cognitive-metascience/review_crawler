the microenvironment. However, the mechanisms by which receptors enable this concerted cellular response remain unclear. To investigate the effect of cellular tension on cell surface receptors, we combined novel high-resolution imaging and single particle tracking with established biochemical assays to examine TGFβ signaling. We find that TGFβ receptors are discretely organized to segregated spatial domains at the cell surface. Integrin-rich focal adhesions organize TβRII around TβRI, limiting the integration of TβRII while sequestering TβRI at these sites. Disruption of cellular tension leads to a collapse of this spatial organization and drives formation of heteromeric TβRI/TβRII complexes and Smad activation. This work details a novel mechanism by which cellular tension regulates TGFβ receptor organization, multimerization, and function, providing new insight into the mechanisms that integrate biochemical and physical cues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09300.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09300.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09300.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells constantly encounter diverse physical and biological signals in their surroundings. Information contained in these signals is transmitted from the cell surface to the interior to trigger coordinated changes in the cell’s behavior. Physical signals include the forces generated by cells pulling on one another or on their surroundings. These pulling forces calibrate the cell’s response to biological signals through mechanisms that remain unclear.</p><p>The cell surface contains many different proteins that are specialized to sense these signals and guide the cell’s response. In animals, these membrane proteins include the receptors that detect a small signaling protein known as TGFβ. TGFβ first binds to one of these receptors (called TβRII). Next another receptor (called TβRI) is recruited to the complex. Once this complex is formed, the TGFβ receptors activate a complicated signaling pathway that controls how cells grow and divide. Previous work has shown that the TGFβ pathway can also sense and respond to mechanical forces. But it remains poorly understood how pulling forces (or tension) impact TGFβ receptors at the cell surface.</p><p>Rys, DuFort et al. have now used cutting-edge microscopy and biochemical techniques to analyze individual TβRI and TβRII receptors and observe how they respond to mechanical forces in real-time. This revealed that TβRI and TβRII exist in discrete regions on the cell surface. Rys, DuFort et al. observed that TβRI is enriched at assemblies of molecules called focal adhesions. Focal adhesions are the sites on cell surfaces that allow cells to adhere to one another and to the molecular scaffolding in their surroundings. Unlike TβRI, TβRII was often excluded from these sites and more commonly appeared to ‘bounce’ around the edges of individual focal adhesions. Therefore, focal adhesions limit the interactions between TβRI and TβRII, by sequestering one away from the other.</p><p>Rys, DuFort et al. next treated cells with a chemical that disrupts tension, and saw that the physical separation between TβRI and TβRII collapsed, which permitted these two receptors to interact and form a working signaling complex. Further work is needed to understand how physical control of TGFβ receptor interactions helps cells coordinate their tasks in response to the myriad biological and physical signals in their surroundings.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09300.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09300.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TGFβ receptor</kwd><kwd>integrin</kwd><kwd>spatial organization</kwd><kwd>focal adhesion</kwd><kwd>cellular tension</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship, 1144247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rys</surname><given-names>Joanna P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000850</institution-id><institution>American Society for Engineering Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monteiro</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>8P41GM103481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burlingame</surname><given-names>Alma L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burlingame</surname><given-names>Alma L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AR067439-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alliston</surname><given-names>Tamara N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DE019284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alliston</surname><given-names>Tamara N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OR130191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alliston</surname><given-names>Tamara N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cells control the spatial organization and signaling of TGFβ receptors at focal adhesions via a mechanically regulated mechanism to integrate biochemical and physical cues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The diversity and specificity of cellular responses rely on the precise integration of biochemical and physical cues from the microenvironment. Cells generate a coordinated response through interactions among signaling pathways – from ligands and receptors to intracellular effectors. Receptors are a particularly versatile locus of control since they undergo regulated microdomain clustering, internalization and homo/hetero-meric multimerization. Because these mechanisms affect ligand binding, enzymatic activity, and effector recruitment, receptors play a crucial role in defining signal intensity, duration, location, and quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bethani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Guglielmo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Groves and Kuriyan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salaita et al., 2010</xref>). However, many questions remain about the mechanisms by which receptors participate in the concerted cellular response to a multitude of concurrent cues.</p><p>The TGFβ signaling pathway exemplifies the importance of regulated receptor multimerization. TGFβ signals through a heterotetrameric complex of transmembrane receptor kinases. Once the TGFβ ligand is activated from its latent form, it binds directly to a dimer of type II receptors (TβRII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Annes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Munger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wipff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Munger and Sheppard, 2011</xref>). The ligand-bound TβRII complex recruits and phosphorylates two type I receptors (TβRI) – either Alk5 or Alk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wrana et al., 2008</xref>). TβRI, in turn, phosphorylates and activates canonical Smad proteins and multiple non-canonical effectors, such as RhoA, TAK1 and Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Massague, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng and Derynck, 2005</xref>). Specifically, recruitment of Alk5 to the TβRII complex stimulates phosphorylation of Smad2/3, whereas Alk1 recruitment drives activation of Smad1/5/8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). The inappropriate shift of TβRII multimerization partner from Alk5 to Alk1 underlies disease processes ranging from vascular disorders to osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaney Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goumans, 2002</xref>). Not only do TGFβ receptors associate with one another, but also with a number of other receptor families, notably integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scaffidi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garamszegi et al., 2010</xref>). Garamszegi et al. revealed a physical interaction between integrin α2β1 and TGFβ receptors involved in collagen-induced Smad phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garamszegi et al., 2010</xref>). TGFβ receptor interactions alter ligand specificity and effector selection, offering a regulatory mechanism to calibrate TGFβ signaling based on the cellular microenvironment.</p><p>Integrins, another class of multimeric receptors, are central to cellular mechanotransduction. Upon integrin binding to the extracellular matrix, the formation of focal adhesions stimulates actomyosin contractility to generate cellular tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DuFort et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giancotti, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ingber, 1997</xref>). Through this Rho/ROCK-dependent mechanism, cells establish tensional homeostasis with the physical features of the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DuFort et al., 2011</xref>). Cellular tension can amplify, alter, or suppress cellular responses to growth factor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McBeath et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The functional state of many intracellular effectors, including β-catenin, YAP/TAZ, and MAPK, is modulated by cellular tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Samuel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). In the case of TGFβ signaling, we and others have identified several mechanosensitive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leight et al., 2012</xref>). The activation of latent TGFβ ligand, as well as the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transactivation of Smads is regulated by cellular tension in a Rho/ROCK-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wipff and Hinz, 2008</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which changes in cellular tension modulate effector activity remain unclear.</p><p>The effect of cellular tension on the multimerization of receptors other than integrins is largely unexplored. In spite of the established tension-sensitive regulation of downstream signaling effectors, the effect of physical cues on growth factor receptor interactions is unknown. This gap in understanding is partly due to the fact that until recently, studies of cell surface receptor colocalization and physical interactions have mostly utilized biochemical, biophysical, or fluorescence imaging approaches. While invaluable, these approaches are limited by their inability to discriminate spatially discrete molecular interactions that occur in specific cellular domains. Novel super-resolution imaging approaches provide the capability to visualize receptor responses to biochemical and physical cues at the single molecule level with spatial and temporal specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coelho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rossier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calebiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2013</xref>). To elucidate mechanisms by which physical cues regulate growth factor signaling, we utilize high-resolution imaging, single particle tracking, mass spectrometry and biochemical assays to test the hypothesis that cellular tension regulates TGFβ receptor multimerization. We find that cellular tension controls the spatial organization, multimerization and activity of a discrete population of TGFβ receptors at integrin-rich focal adhesions, suggesting a novel mechanism by which physical cues calibrate the activity of the TGFβ signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Discrete localization of TβRI and TβRII to segregated spatial domains</title><p>To investigate the spatiotemporal control of TGFβ receptors, we evaluated the localization of endogenous and fluorescently tagged TβRII and TβRI in ATDC5 chondroprogenitor cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence of TβRII in both wildtype and transfected ATDC5 cells yielded similar results, revealing specific punctate staining that did not provide structural information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Proceeding with fluorescently tagged TβRII allowed for visualization of fine structural features in static and dynamic conditions. Spinning disc confocal microscopy of TβRII-mEmerald allowed visualization of its spatial organization, revealing shadowed regions where TβRII expression is completely absent (indicated by arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy improves visualization of transmembrane proteins by examining a thin section of the sample at the adherent cell surface. Switching from widefield microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) to TIRF on the same cell vividly revealed segregated domains of TβRII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and TβRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). The sequestration of TβRII from TβRI was present with either the canonical (Alk5) or non-canonical (Alk1) type I TGFβ receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Indeed, when co-expressed in the same cell, TβRII is enriched at the boundary of discrete TβRI domains, demonstrating a novel spatial segregation of these signaling partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–L</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09300.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spatial segregation of TβRII from TβRI.</title><p>Spinning disc confocal imaging of endogenous TβRII (<bold>A</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) demonstrates punctate staining.

Single-particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy (sptPALM) resolves the dynamics of individual molecules in live single cells. Using sptPALM, we captured thousands of trajectories of individual TβRI (Alk5) and TβRII proteins labeled with photoswitchable mEos2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKinney et al., 2009</xref>). The large number of long duration molecular trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) allowed us to visualize single molecule track behavior and describe molecular environments within individual cells. For both TβRI and TβRII, individual receptors showed a range of mobility, resulting in groups of immobile, confined, or freely diffusive receptors (representative tracks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Mobility of each group of TβRI did not differ significantly from TβRII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), but the diffusion coefficient of TβRI was slightly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), perhaps because of its lower molecular weight (TβRI/Alk5 56 kDa vs. TβRII 65 kDa). Relative to whole cell TGFβ receptor dynamics, TβRI and TβRII are significantly less mobile in cellular domains enriched with clusters of spatially organized receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus, this spatially organized population of TGFβ receptors is slower and more confined, possibly due to interactions with other proteins.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09300.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Limited TβRI (Alk5) and TβRII mobility in areas of receptor spatial organization.</title><p>All mEos2-tagged TβRI and TβRII sptPALM single molecule trajectories with durations of at least 5 frames (500 ms) are plotted for representative ATDC5 cells, in which each color represents a different track (<bold>A,B</bold>).

Among these, integrins bind to TβRI and TβRII and functionally interact with the TGFβ pathway at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wrana et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scaffidi et al., 2004</xref>). The primary integrins in chondrocytes are integrins α2 and αV, which bind collagen and vitronectin/fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loeser, 2000</xref>). Both integrins interact with the TGFβ pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scaffidi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garamszegi et al., 2010</xref>). TIRF imaging of mCherry-labelled integrin α2 revealed the presence of focal adhesions at these TβR-rich sites. Specifically, TβRII is absent from sites of adhesions and forms a peripheral ring surrounding integrin α2, resulting in distinct patterns of spatial localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, this spatial organization is absent in cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated substrates that facilitate integrin-independent cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, TβRII organization at sites of adhesion is dependent upon integrin activity. Profile plots of intensity and a custom analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ai,Bi,Ci</xref>) were utilized to quantify colocalization between TβRs and integrin α2 across multiple cells. The slope of the regression line can be used as a metric, in which higher values indicate increased colocalization of two proteins. TβRI (Alk5 and Alk1) is precisely colocalized with integrin α2 within focal adhesions, such that adhesions appear yellow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>) and regression line slopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Bi,Ci</xref>) are higher relative to TβRII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,Ai</xref>). This analysis reveals that integrin α2 colocalizes significantly more with Alk5 and Alk1 than with TβRII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The specific localization of TβRII near focal adhesions is apparent in cells of both mesenchymal (ATDC5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C,E</xref>; Saos-2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and epithelial (MCF10A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) origin and is observed whether integrin α2 or integrin αV is tagged with a fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, this observation still holds if the fluorescent labels for TβRII and integrin α2 are switched, as well as if TβRII is expressed and imaged alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,H</xref>). The overall spatial organization of TGFβ receptors at sites of adhesion is not affected upon stimulation with exogenous TGFβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), suggesting that this spatiotemporal organization is regulated through mechanisms independent from TGFβ ligand addition. Given the critical role of integrins in mechanotransduction and the known sensitivity of TGFβ signaling to cellular tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>), the unique pattern of TGFβ receptor and integrin localization could prime TGFβ receptors for regulation by elements of the mechanotransduction pathway.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09300.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Focal adhesions sequester TβRI from TβRII.</title><p>TIRF mode imaging and a custom colocalization analysis were used to evaluate localization of TβRII (<bold>A</bold>), Alk5 (<bold>B</bold>), or Alk1 (<bold>C</bold>) with integrin α2 in ATDC5 cells.

SptPALM shows, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that TβRI is preferentially enriched and TβRII is preferentially excluded at sites of adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Analysis of individual TβRII trajectories shows that TβRII ‘bounces’ around the edges of individual focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) but is rarely incorporated within the focal adhesion, as is common for TβRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,i–ii</xref>). To determine if focal adhesions shifted the fractions of freely diffusive, confined, or immobile receptors, TβRI and TβRII trajectories near sites of adhesion were mapped based on receptor mobility.

The differential localization and dynamics of TβRI and TβRII in adhesion-rich domains, relative to one another and to the whole cell TGFβ receptor population, indicates that this spatial control has functional implications for TGFβ signaling and for mechanotransduction.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09300.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Dynamic interaction of TβRs with integrins facilitate spatial organization.</title><p>Representative trajectories for TβRI (Alk5) overlaid with the tagged focal adhesion marker vinculin are consistent with TIRF results showing a colocalization and interaction between integrin-based adhesions and TβRI (<bold>A</bold>) but not TβRII (<bold>B</bold>).

Mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that precipitate with Flag-tagged TβRI (Alk5) and TβRII revealed hundreds of proteins, several of which were specifically enriched compared with precipitates of untransfected (mock) cells. The analysis identified proteins already known to interact with TβRs, such as PRMT5 and PRMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). TβRs also precipitated several adhesion-related proteins, including integrin αV and endogenous cofilin, as shown in the annotated spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). The peptide counts (graph insets) indicate that integrin αV associates with both TβRI and TβRII, and that cofilin preferentially associates with TβRII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Cofilin is an actin-binding protein that severs ADP-actin filaments at the leading edge of migratory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>).

To confirm these mass spectrometry findings, we performed co-immunoprecipitation on cells expressing Flag-tagged TβRI/II and tagged integrin αV or cofilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Consistent with the mass spectrometry peptide counts, integrin αV forms a complex with both TβRI and TβRII, whereas cofilin primarily interacts with TβRII.

Culturing cells on compliant substrates leads to significantly increased endogenous Smad3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of TGFβ on Smad3 phosphorylation is substrate-dependent, such that TGFβ induces Smad3 phosphorylation on 0.5 kPa substrates but not on 16 kPa substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This is consistent with the established non-linear response of TGFβ signaling and other cellular behaviors to cellular tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rape et al., 2015</xref>). Thus the spatial organization of TβRI and TβRII by integrins at focal adhesions affords tension-sensitive control of TβRI and TβRII multimerization and activation of Smad3, providing a mechanosensitive mechanism by which cells calibrate their response to TGFβ.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we show that cellular tension regulates TGFβ receptor spatial organization and interactions at focal adhesions, providing a novel mechanism for the cellular integration of signaling by physical and biochemical cues. We observe a novel spatiotemporal regulation of the TGFβ pathway such that TβRII is segregated from TβRI and integrins at sites of adhesions. Single particle tracking reveals the dynamics of individual TGFβ receptor molecules, and identifies populations of TGFβ receptors with distinct behaviors and mobility near and far from sites of focal adhesions. The confined population of TGFβ receptors at focal adhesions has lower mobility than the freely diffusive receptor population far from sites of adhesion. TGFβ receptors associate with several adhesion-related proteins, including the actin-binding protein cofilin, which preferentially associates with TβRII relative to TβRI. This novel spatial organization of TβRI and TβRII at sites of adhesion provides mechanosensitive control of TGFβ receptor multimerization and function independently of TGFβ ligand stimulation. Overall, this reveals the potential of two differentially regulated populations of TGFβ receptors – one that is TGFβ-sensitive and one that is tension-sensitive – a finding that may contribute to the context-dependent signaling outcomes of this pathway.</p><p>This tension-dependent mechanism for the regulation of TGFβ receptors has a number of interesting functional implications. At the level of the TGFβ ligand, integrins activate TGFβ from its latent form through cellular tension generated by actomyosin contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wipff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Munger and Sheppard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wells and Discher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giacomini et al., 2012</xref>). The observed recruitment of TGFβ receptors to focal adhesions would enrich their access to this reservoir of integrin-activated TGFβ. At the receptor level, focal adhesions may sequester TβRI from TβRII to limit their activity in the presence of ligand. The extent to which this sequestration is cofilin-dependent requires further investigation. This sequestration of TβRI may contribute to its slow internalization, relative to TβRII, following TGFβ stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vizan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, focal adhesions may create structured TβRI and TβRII boundaries that prime a robust response when cells encounter the correct combination of physical and biochemical cues. We demonstrate tension-sensitive regulation of endogenous downstream Smad3 phosphorylation by cellular tension and TGFβ. In addition, chondrocytes grown in TGFβ on 0.5 MPa substrates induce differentiation markers far beyond levels induced by either cue alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>). We and others have reported that the effect of substrate stiffness or cellular tension/Rho/ROCK activity on downstream TGFβ signaling is synergistic and nonlinear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leight et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that lower cell tension in one cell type may have a differential effect on Smad phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and transactivation than in another cell type. It would be interesting to examine this effect utilizing a substrate system that provides independent and continuous gradients of ligand density and substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rape et al., 2015</xref>). The mechanisms responsible for such synergy have been unclear, but this newly described regulation of TGFβ receptor multimerization and downstream signaling may couple the mechanosensitive activity of the TGFβ pathway to physical cues. Fully understanding the functional implications of this spatially-distinct TGFβ receptor population will require the development of new imaging tools, such as those that can dynamically visualize TGFβ effector activity locally at focal adhesions.</p><p>The current study of TGFβ receptors opens the possibility that tension-sensitive receptor multimerization may underlie mechanosensitive signaling by other pathways. Cellular tension impacts the activation, translocation, and function of intracellular effectors including small GTP-ases, kinases and transcriptional regulators such as Smads and YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leight et al., 2012</xref>). However, known mechanisms are insufficient to explain the ability of physical cues to modulate cell-type specific responses to BMP, EGF, and other growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paszek et al., 2005</xref>). Several receptor families share features with TGFβ receptors that may contribute to their mechanosensitivity, such as their association with integrin-rich focal adhesions and their potential for the formation of stable receptor clusters by geometric constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bethani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salaita et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartman and Groves, 2011</xref>). Previous studies have established important physical and functional links between focal adhesion components and growth factor receptors. EGF receptor binds actin and colocalizes with integrin α2β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2007</xref>), while the receptor CD44 interacts with several components of the focal adhesion complex, such that hyaluronan-bound CD44 activates c-Src and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Turley et al., 2002</xref>). Aside from TGFβ, shown herein, the extent to which these physical associations contribute to mechanosensitive control of receptor multimerization or downstream signaling remains to be determined. Nonetheless, others have postulated receptor multimerization as a mechanism for mechanocoupling of TGFβ, ephrin, and T cell receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartman and Groves, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hynes, 2009</xref>). In each case, the solid state presentation of the ligand is thought to play a critical role in structuring multimeric receptor clusters. In T cell receptor and ephrin signaling, the solid state is provided by ligands on the neighboring cell, which create geometric constraints that mechanically trap receptors to induce clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bethani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salaita et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartman and Groves, 2011</xref>). For growth factors like TGFβ, BMP, and EGF, the ECM serves as the solid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hynes, 2009</xref>). ECM proteins such as collagen II bind both TGFβ and integrin α2β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhu, 1999</xref>), imposing geometric constraints that may structure receptor clusters. Therefore, growth factor receptor multimerization at focal adhesions, controlled by receptor interactions with integrins and with solid state growth factors, provide focal adhesions with the capability to integrate signaling between physical and biochemical cues.</p><p>Understanding the mechanosensitive regulation of TGFβ signaling has significant biological implications. We find that focal adhesions segregate TβRI from TβRII in both epithelial and mesenchymal cell lineages, opening the possibility that this is a general cellular mechanism for the control of TGFβ signaling. It will be interesting to determine if TGFβ receptor multimerization at focal adhesions responds to physical cues that aberrantly promote TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer or the loss of chondrocyte homeostasis in osteoarthritis. On stiff substrates, TGFβ preferentially activates PI3K to induce EMT instead of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leight et al., 2012</xref>). In osteoarthritis, the material properties of the cartilage ECM deteriorate as chondrocytes inappropriately shift the balance from canonical (Alk5/Smad2/3) to non-canonical (Alk1/Smad1/5/8) TβRI signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaney Davidson et al., 2009</xref>). In each case, the extent to which changing the physical environment alters TGFβ effector selection through differential TGFβ receptor multimerization remains to be determined. Applied physical cues, such as compression or shear flow, also regulate TGFβ signaling in cartilage, vasculature, and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Streuli, 1993</xref>). Whether similar mechanisms operate in response to exogenous physical cues remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In conclusion, we utilized novel high-resolution imaging and single particle tracking microscopy coupled with biochemical assays to explore the spatial organization of TGFβ signaling at the receptor level. At focal adhesions, TβRII is uniquely segregated from its TβRI counterpart. Cellular tension modulates the spatial organization, multimerization, and downstream signaling of TGFβ receptors at sites of adhesion, suggesting the existence of a functionally distinct subpopulation of TGFβ receptors. Overall, this finding provides a new mechanism by which cellular tension and physical cues exert control of growth factor signaling at the cellular membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The plasmids pRK5 TGFβ type I receptor Flag and pRK5 TGFβ type II receptor Flag were gifts from Rik Derynck (Addgene plasmids 14,831 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng and Derynck, 1996</xref>), 31719).

MSD was computed as per <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rossier et al., 2012</xref>):</p><p><disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>·</mml:mo><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are the coordinates of the molecule at time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of frames for which the trajectory persisted.

Immobile molecules were defined as being restricted to a radius of confinement equal to one pixel (r<sub>conf</sub> &lt; 0.166 μm). Confined molecules were defined as non-immobile tracks with a diffusion coefficient <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> of less than 0.2 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, and the remaining tracks were considered freely diffusive. Custom routines written for Python were used for track quantification, analysis, and visualization (source code). To account for variability in these large data sets consisting of tens of thousands of tracks, we report mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction and student’s <italic>t</italic> test were used to evaluate statistical significance.</p><p>To quantify the diffusive behavior of TβRI and TβRII around focal adhesions, we calculated an enrichment ratio to compare track densities in several (N≥5) focal adhesion-rich regions (where vinculin covered more than 25% of total area) across at least three cells. The enrichment ratio was defined as the ratio of the track density (tracks/µm<sup>2</sup>) inside adhesions to the track density outside adhesions within a given area. Student’s <italic>t</italic> test was used to evaluate statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For colocalization quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and enrichment ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), we report mean and standard deviation (SD). There are three circumstances in which it was more statistically appropriate to report the standard error of the mean (SEM). Specifically, to account for variability in large sptPALM data sets (consisting of tens of thousands of tracks), we report mean and SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

We have performed several experiments to address this point, including those helpfully suggested by the reviewers. A variety of imaging and biochemical outcomes collectively yield new data that strongly support the regulation of TGFβ receptor heteromerization and downstream signaling by cellular tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>To determine the effect of integrin adhesion on TβR localization, we examined integrin α2-mCherry and TβRII-mEmerald localization in ATDC5 cells grown on substrates coated with collagen II, poly-l-lysine, or integrin blocking antibodies. Cells were imaged with spinning disc confocal and TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). TβRII was excluded from integrin-rich focal adhesions in cells grown on collagen II-coated substrates. On the other hand, when grown on poly-l-lysine-coated substrates where binding does not require integrins, cells do not form adhesions and show no evidence of TβRII exclusion. We observed identical but less striking results when cells were plated on substrates coated with integrin inhibitory (4B4) antibodies (not shown). These findings indicate that integrin-mediated adhesion is required for the unique spatial organization of TβRII, and that this organization is maintained with high cellular tension.</p><p>The strongest support for mechanoregulation of TβR heteromerization has come from new biochemical outcomes that correspond to the increased TβRII/integrin α2 colocalization observed following ROCK or myosin II inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-E</xref>). First, with the reduction in cellular tension following ROCK inhibition, TβRI preferentially co-precipitates with its signaling partner TβRII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Second, a reduction in cellular tension by culture of cells on compliant substrates also promotes co-precipitation of TβRI with TβRII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Third, a reduction in cellular tension by culture of cells on compliant substrates drives Smad3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, Allen et al., 2012). Finally, the tension-dependent changes in TβRI/TβRII multimerization and Smad3 phosphorylation correspond to changes in TGFβ-inducible Smad nuclear translocation (not shown, Allen et al., 2012). Therefore, these data extend and further strengthen the conclusion that cellular tension controls the spatial organization and formation of active TβRI/TβRII complexes as well as the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of the key TGFβ effector Smad3.</p><p>Several other approaches to examine the effect of cellular tension on TβR localization did not yield definitive results, largely due to technical limitations. As the reviewers indicate, TIRF imaging on gels is extremely difficult because the refractive index is not matched to that of glass. Confocal imaging could not definitively discriminate the effect of cellular tension on TβR localization in cells grown on variable stiffness substrates (polyacrylamide or PDMS). We also manipulated cellular tension by varying the size, shape, and surface area of micropatterned adhesive substrates acquired from collaborators and from commercial sources. Although imaging revealed cellular adhesions on each of these substrates, the resolution was insufficient to determine the effect of cellular tension on TβR spatial organization. Significant additional technical and scientific effort, beyond the scope of the current project, is needed to successfully use TIRF to determine the effect of these micropatterns on TGFβ receptor localization.</p><p><italic>2) The experiments need to be better explained (e.g. time courses of the experiments performed, concentrations of matrices used, rationale for selecting only and exclusively αV and α2 containing integrins).</italic></p><p>We revised the Methods to include the requested experimental details. We have revised the Results to explain the rationale for evaluating integrins α2 and αV. Integrins α2 and αV were chosen since they are primary integrins in chondrocytes, where they bind collagen and vitronectin/fibronectin, respectively. Furthermore, both of these integrins have been shown to interact with the TGFβ pathway. For example, integrin αV activates TGFβ ligand from its latent form through generation of cellular tension (Wipff et al., 2007), and integrin α2β1 physically associates with TGFβ receptors during collagen-induced Smad phosphorylation (Garamszegi et al., 2010; Introduction). It will be interesting to further expand these studies to examine other integrin members as well as other cell types in the future.</p><p><italic>3) Thus far all the data provided are with over-expressed proteins. It is important to validate the TIRF data with staining of endogenous proteins to demonstrate that the sequestration is not an artifact of tagged proteins or overexpression.</italic></p><p>We share the reviewers’ concern and have worked hard to demonstrate the relevance of these findings to the endogenous TGFβ signaling pathway. The revised manuscript addresses this concern with new data, including mass spectrometry for endogenous TβR interacting proteins and assays for activation of endogenous TGFβ effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>As suggested, we tried to augment the manuscript with data showing the spatial localization of endogenous TGFβ receptors. However, we were limited by the well-known lack of suitable reagents for immunofluorescent detection of endogenous TβRI or TβRII. Indeed, few published studies show TβR IF. Those that do are unable to achieve the resolution apparent in studies by our group and others that use fluorescently-tagged TβRs (Ma et al., 2007). Our attempts to visualize endogenous TβRs with two different TβRII antibodies and two different TβRI antibodies showed specificity relative to IgG controls and were comparable to published results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; Garamszegi et al., 2010). Unfortunately, this bright punctate staining was inadequate to observe finer spatial organization. Furthermore, this approach is limited by the inability to perform dynamic imaging, which is essential for the fundamental understanding of these receptor-receptor interactions and their responses to physical or biological stimuli (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). In spite of the inability to visualize the spatial organization of endogenous TβRs, the implication of endogenous Smad3 in tension-dependent regulation of TGFβ signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) gives confidence that these findings are physiologically relevant.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows the results of mass spectrometry analysis of TβRI/TβRII interacting proteins that may participate in their spatial organization at focal adhesions. In addition to anticipated identification of co-expressed integrin αV, TβRII binds to endogenous cofilin, an actin-binding protein involved in the regulation of actin filaments and in cell motility. The peptide counts indicate that endogenous cofilin preferentially associates with TβRII relative to TβRI, a finding supported by co-IP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Future studies will examine additional candidates that may contribute to this discrete spatial organization and explore the functional role of cofilin in the mechanoregulation of TβR heteromerization and function.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows the tension-sensitive regulation of endogenous Smad3 phosphorylation by cellular tension and TGFβ. We performed the same experiment in cells with and without overexpressed TβRI/TβRII and achieved the same results (not shown). This evidence that cellular tension regulates the endogenous TGFβ signaling pathway complements our prior observations of stiffness-dependent regulation of endogenous TGFβ1 and chondrocyte marker gene expression, as well as the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of endogenous Smad3 (Allen et al., 2012). These findings demonstrate the capacity for cellular tension to modulate the activity of the endogenous TGFβ signaling pathway.</p><p><italic>4) Some data are over interpreted. The authors talk about physical association between TβRI and integrin αV or TβRI and integrin αV. Given that the IPs presented were performed on cell lysates of overexpressing cells, then the authors can only conclude that TβRI and TβRII form a complex with integrins, but whether this is a direct contact needs to be addressed by better protein-protein interactions assays.</italic></p><p>We agree that additional studies are required to conclude that the interaction of TβRs with integrins is direct. We revised the text to clearly communicate that this interaction may be indirect (Results). Future experiments will involve assays such as FRET and BRET to confirm the interactions between TβRs and integrins. Receptors tagged with validated FRET pairs, such as mTurquoise and mNeonGreen (Shaner et al., 2013), will be used to monitor the dynamics and proximity of protein interactions inside living cells.</p><p><italic>5) Importantly, it is not clear what the significance of the study proposed truly is. The authors show that cellular tension might regulate multimerization of TβRI and TβRII, but whether this has any implication in receptor activation, downstream signaling and, importantly, cell function is highly debatable. The authors finish the paper suggesting that &quot;…which would be required to activate downstream signalling&quot;. This should be tested experimentally.</italic></p><p>We found that manipulation of cellular tension through ROCK inhibition or culture on variable stiffness substrates regulates TGFβ receptor multimerization. Specifically, culturing cells on plastic with Y27632 or culturing cells on a soft 0.5 kPa substrate drives TβRI/TβRII complex formation. These conditions correspond to TGFβ-inducible Smad3 phosphorylation. This suggests that cellular tension can structurally prime TGFβ receptors to respond to the addition of TGFβ, consistent with previous findings (Allen et al., 2012). Overall, these new data strengthen our finding of a novel mechanism by which cellular tension regulates the spatial organization and downstream signaling of TGFβ.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The data regarding the sensitivity of endogenous TGFβ to stiffness of the matrix are interesting and important for the study. While they address most of the points raised by the reviewers it seems that in their current form they fall short of the scientific quality expected for eLife. The figure legends do not indicate how many times these experiments have been performed. The gold standard would be 3 and for statistics 4 would be recommended. Please repeat these experiments if necessary and provide quantification from 3-4 independent biological replicates to validate the claims for increased co-precipitation and altered SMAD-signalling.</italic></p><p>1) We carefully reviewed all of our Western/IP analyses, especially those evaluating the effect of substrate stiffness on TβRI/TβRII complex formation and Smad phosphorylation. Indeed, each experiment was repeated independently a minimum of 3 times. The Methods, rather than the figure legends, were updated where needed to consistently describe and define in more detail the number and type of replicates used for all studies, as follows:</p><p>“Blots shown are representative of multiple technical replicates of at least three independent experiments for each condition (N≥3).”</p><p>2) Because of the importance of the conclusions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> regarding the effect of substrate stiffness on TGFβ receptor multimerization and Smad3 phosphorylation, we appreciate the opportunity to rigorously document these findings. Prior to our first resubmission, we had performed these experiments three independent times, but did not quantify the results. We added another biological replicate for experiments performed on substrates of varying stiffness, for a total N≥4. We see that the increase in TGFβ receptor multimerization on the 0.5 kPa substrate is qualitatively reproducible and quantitatively increased across all 5 biological replicates, with a significant difference of p &lt; 0.05 (N=5).</p><p>Similarly, the stiffness-dependent regulation of basal and TGFβ-inducible Smad3 phosphorylation is reproducible and visually evident across multiple biological and technical replicates. In addition, the increase in Smad3 phosphorylation on the 0.5 kPa substrate, without and with added TGFβ, is statistically significant relative to the plastic control (p &lt; 0.05, N=4). In some cases, the apparent qualitative differences are reflected in the quantitative analyses, even though they do not achieve statistically significance. We believe that the conclusions described in the Results are supported by the Figures and by the addition of a new Source Data file showing the raw data used for the quantitative analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The details of this quantitative analysis have been added to the Methods, as follows:</p><p>“Where indicated, quantitative analysis was performed using ImageJ. Band intensity for proteins of interest was normalized to band intensity of controls (Flag for co-IP and β-actin for whole cell extract). Fold change in band intensity was calculated relative to plastic control samples. ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction and student’s t-test were used to evaluate statistical significance.”</p><p>In addition, the p value has been added to the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and the word ‘significantly’ has been added to the corresponding section of the Results, as follows:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> Legend: “Likewise, manipulation of cellular tension through culturing cells on collagen II-coated glass or 0.5 kPa PDMS substrates increases co-immunoprecipitation of TβRI with Flag-tagged TβRII (p &lt; 0.05, B). In cells grown on collagen II-coated compliant (0.5 kPa, p &lt; 0.05) or stiff (16 kPa) PDMS substrates, endogenous Smad3 phosphorylation is increased (C). The effect of TGFβ on Smad3 phosphorylation is substrate-dependent, such that maximal TGFβ-inducibility is observed on 0.5 kPa substrates (p &lt; 0.05), consistent with a tension-sensitive calibration of TβR localization and activity (C). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>.”</p><p>Results: “A reduction in cellular tension through culture on compliant substrates <italic>significantly</italic> drives TβRI/TβRII complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).
