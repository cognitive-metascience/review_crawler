inactive, GDP-bound states. However, 90–95% of RhoGTPases are maintained in a soluble form by RhoGDI, which is generally viewed as a passive shuttle for inactive RhoGTPases. Our current understanding of RhoGTPase:RhoGDI dynamics has been limited by two experimental challenges: direct visualization of the RhoGTPases in vivo and reconstitution of the cycle in vitro. We developed methods to directly image vertebrate RhoGTPases in vivo or on lipid bilayers in vitro. Using these methods, we identified pools of active and inactive RhoGTPase associated with the membrane, found that RhoGDI can extract both inactive and active RhoGTPases, and found that extraction of active RhoGTPase contributes to their spatial regulation around cell wounds. These results indicate that RhoGDI directly contributes to the spatiotemporal patterning of RhoGTPases by removing active RhoGTPases from the plasma membrane.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Organisms rely on many signaling molecules to control how their cells grow, divide and heal. For example, when the cell membrane is damaged, two signaling proteins, Rho and Cdc42, are recruited to wounds and activated to promote repair. Active Rho and active Cdc42 form two concentric rings at the membrane to direct the closure of the wound.</p><p>Rho and Cdc42 belong to the RhoGTPase family, a group of proteins that act as molecular switches and alternate between active and inactive forms. At the level of the cell, RhoGTPases are only active in the tiny patches of the membrane where they bind. However, individual proteins hop on and off membranes in a matter of seconds, only staying bound for short periods. This mechanism is controlled by a regulatory protein known as RhoGDI, and it allows RhoGTPases to form precise patterns of activity at membranes – such as the rings that surround a wound site. However, it was not known exactly how RhoGDI regulates the activity of RhoGTPases over space and time, partly because it is difficult to study these proteins in the laboratory.</p><p>To fill this knowledge gap, Golding, Visco et al. developed new fluorescent probes to track Rho and Cdc42 in wounded cells from frogs and on artificial membranes. The experiments showed that pools of inactive Cdc42 accumulated on membranes, alongside the active form of the protein. RhoGDI removed both active and inactive RhoGTPases from artificial and frog cell membranes. In fact, removing active Rho and Cdc42 proteins from the cell membrane was necessary to form the spatial patterns of RhoGTPase activity observed in wounded frog cells.</p><p>The findings of Golding, Visco et al. help to understand how RhoGDI proteins regulate RhoGTPases and provide new tools to further study these proteins. In humans, mutations in either RhoGDI or Cdc42 are responsible for severe conditions such as Nephrotic Syndrome Type 8 or Takenouchi-Kosaki syndrome. In the future, this work may aid the development of treatments and cures for these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RhoGTPase</kwd><kwd>RhoGDI</kwd><kwd>Cdc42</kwd><kwd>Rho</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM52932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bement</surname><given-names>William M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007015</institution-id><institution>University of Wisconsin-Madison</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dr. Stanley and Dr. Eva Lurie Weinreb Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Golding</surname><given-names>Adriana E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HSFP CDA00070-2017-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bieling</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Visco</surname><given-names>Ilaria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MaxSynBio Consortium</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Visco</surname><given-names>Ilaria</given-names></name><name><surname>Bieling</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>399893760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bieling</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Visco</surname><given-names>Ilaria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Through visualization of directly-labeled RhoGTPase both in vitro and in vivo, RhoGDI is found to spatiotemporally regulate RhoGTPase activity through the extraction of active RhoGTPase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Rho family GTPases, including Rho, Rac and Cdc42, are essential signaling proteins that mediate morphological changes in cells by directing local cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop and Hall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>). These rearrangements are generally initiated at and confined to specific subcellular regions. For example, a narrow, concentrated zone of Rho activity directs the formation of a ring of actin filaments and myosin-2 at the equatorial cortex that drives cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bement et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yonemura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yüce et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, Rho, Rac and Cdc42 are activated near the leading edge of crawling cells in patterns that correspond to local cycles of protrusion, adhesion and retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Machacek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). Because tight spatiotemporal regulation of the GTPases is a fundamental feature of these cellular processes, considerable effort has been invested in studying GTPase regulation.</p><p>The RhoGTPases are classically characterized as cycling between membrane-associated, active states and soluble, inactive states as a result of interactions with three classes of regulatory proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which activate GTPases by promoting exchange of GDP for GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rossman et al., 2005</xref>); GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which inactivate GTPases by promoting GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moon and Zheng, 2003</xref>); and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which solubilize GTPases to generate a large reservoir of heterodimeric GTPase:GDI complexes in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia-Mata et al., 2011</xref>). In the canonical model of GTPase regulation, GTPase cycling is thought to proceed as follows: a GTPase is activated by a GEF at the plasma membrane following its release from GDI, is subsequently inactivated by a GAP, and is then returned to the soluble pool by GDI. Thus, the lifetime of GTPase activity at the plasma membrane is generally thought to be controlled entirely by GEFs and GAPs, with GDIs essentially serving as passive shuttles that interact exclusively with inactive GTPases.</p><p>The notion that RhoGDIs work as passive shuttles rests largely on two findings. First, when GTPase:GDI complexes are purified from cell lysates, the great majority of GTPase within the complex is in the inactive, GDP-bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abo et al., 1994</xref>), as expected if GDI solubilizes GTPases after inactivation by a GAP. Second, binding of GTPases by GDI strongly suppresses GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hart et al., 1992</xref>), indicating that hydrolysis must precede extraction from the membrane. However, work by several labs has shown that GDIs bind both inactive and active GTPases with relatively high affinity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hancock and Hall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hart et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nomanbhoy and Cerione, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tnimov et al., 2012</xref>), leading to the suggestion that GDIs may interact with active as well as inactive GTPases in vivo. As such, GDIs might have the potential to exert a more direct role in the regulation of GTPase activity than currently appreciated.</p><p>In contrast to GEFs and GAPs, the biochemical activities of GDIs are not well understood. Presently, no consensus exists as to (1) the mechanism by which GDIs extract GTPases from membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), (2) whether GDIs interact with GTPases in a nucleotide-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nomanbhoy and Cerione, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tnimov et al., 2012</xref>), or (3) how GDI activity is coordinated with GEFs or GAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia-Mata et al., 2011</xref>). This uncertainty stems in part from experimental limitations in studying GTPase:GDI dynamics. First, fusion with fluorescent proteins at the amino terminus can impair GTPase localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yonemura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yüce et al., 2005</xref>) and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freisinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendezú et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coll et al., 2007</xref>) while fusion with the carboxyl-terminus prevents prenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howell et al., 2012</xref>). In the absence of direct visualization, GTPase dynamics had to be inferred from activity probes. Second, with a few important exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nomanbhoy et al., 1999</xref>), in vitro studies of GTPase:GDI dynamics have utilized unprenylated GTPases, omitted membranes, or both. Additionally, nearly all of these reconstitution experiments focused on the effect of GDI on membrane-associated or soluble GTPases at thermodynamic equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we do not currently understand how GDI affects the transitions between membrane and soluble GTPase states kinetically. This is especially true under conditions which mimic the cellular environment, which is far from equilibrium due to the constant dissipation of energy.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we developed two distinct methods to directly visualize vertebrate RhoGTPases in vivo and on supported lipid bilayers in vitro. Using these tools, we identify co-existing pools of active and inactive GTPases associated with the plasma membrane and provide additional evidence that GDI can extract both inactive and active GTPases in vitro, as suggested by previous steady-state affinity measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hancock and Hall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leonard et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nomanbhoy and Cerione, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tnimov et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, we show that the extraction of active GTPase also occurs in vivo and that this contributes to the spatial regulation of GTPase activity. Collectively, these results indicate that GDI itself can indeed directly mediate the spatiotemporal regulation of GTPase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualization of RhoGTPases around single-cell wounds</title><p>Fusion of fluorescent proteins with the carboxy-terminus of RhoGTPases prevents prenylation, while fusion with the amino-terminus can impair their localization and function. This is likely due to occlusion of the switch I/II regions of the GTPase, which is the binding interface for all of its protein:protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dvorsky and Ahmadian, 2004</xref>). Regardless of the explanation, it has been demonstrated that GFP- and YFP-Rho fail to concentrate at the cell equator during cytokinesis in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yonemura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yüce et al., 2005</xref>). Further, in gene replacement studies in yeast, amino-terminally tagged Cdc42 fails to localize properly, yields temperature sensitivity and/or aberrant morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendezú et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coll et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freisinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watson et al., 2014</xref>). We have also found that mCh-Rho, Rac and Cdc42 are not properly recruited to wounds in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes. Specifically, the zones of recruitment defined by amino-terminally tagged GTPases are much less focused and much less intense than those obtained with either the activity reporters or the internally-tagged GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; see below for functional analysis).</p><p>To overcome this problem, we first adapted an approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendezú et al. (2015)</xref> for labeling of yeast Cdc42. We inserted GFP into a solvent-exposed external loop of the <italic>X. laevis</italic> GTPases (see Methods). To test the internally-tagged (IT) GTPases in vivo, we exploited the cell wound repair model in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes where wounding elicits a robust accumulation of active Rho and Cdc42 in discrete, concentric zones at the cortex as previously indicated by GTPase activity reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benink and Bement, 2005</xref>). It is important to note that (1) IT-GTPases were co-expressed with wild-type (WT) GDI to avoid disrupting the GTPase:GDI stoichiometric ratio, thereby preventing GTPase aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boulter et al., 2010</xref>), and (2) IT-GTPases were expressed at the minimal level necessary to detect signal around the wound (36% above endogenous Rho, based on proteomic data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wühr et al., 2014</xref>) to avoid potential overexpression phenotypes (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both IT-Rho and IT-Cdc42 were recruited to concentric rings around the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Comparison of IT-Rho to a Rho activity reporter (mRFP-2xrGBD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davenport et al., 2016</xref>) revealed that IT-Rho spatially overlapped with the Rho activity zone. Comparison of IT-Cdc42 to a Cdc42 activity reporter (mRFP-wGBD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benink and Bement, 2005</xref>) revealed that IT-Cdc42 localized throughout the active Cdc42 zone, as well as extended slightly beyond it towards the wound center (see also below). We also tested the behavior of IT-Rac and found that it concentrated around wounds in the same region as IT-Cdc42, as expected from previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abreu-Blanco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benink and Bement, 2001</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Direct visualization of Rho and Cdc42 during cell wound repair.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: image of active Cdc42 (magenta) and active Rho (green) around single-cell wound in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte; right: schematic diagram indicating zone regions; (<bold>B</bold>) Wound in oocyte microinjected with rGBD (active Rho, magenta) and IT-Rho (green); (<bold>B’</bold>) Line scan of normalized fluorescence intensity from (<bold>B</bold>); (<bold>C</bold>) As in B but with wGBD (active Cdc42, magenta) and IT-Cdc42 (green); (<bold>D,D'</bold>) As in B but with Cy3-Rho (magenta) and rGBD (green); (<bold>E,E'</bold>) As in B but with Cy3-Cdc42 (magenta) and wGBD (green); (<bold>F,F'</bold>) As in B but with Cy3-Rho (magenta) and IT-Rho (green); (<bold>G,G'</bold>) As in B but with Cy3-Cdc42 (magenta) and IT-Cdc42 (green) and line scan.

Strikingly, Cdc42 activity around wounds was significantly elevated, in contrast to Rho which was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E,F</xref>). To assess whether the increase in activity was due to an increase of total Cdc42 around wounds as opposed to competition between GDI-QQ and the Cdc42 activity probe, we repeated the experiment with Cy3-Cdc42. Similar to the results obtained with the activity reporter, expression of GDI-QQ elevated Cy3-Cdc42 levels around wounds relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G,H</xref>). Cumulatively, these data suggest that GDI directly extracts active Cdc42 throughout the Cdc42 zone, and that extraction of active Cdc42 is necessary for its regulation around wounds.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Direct visualization of the RhoGTPases in living cells is essential for the understanding of their complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We have established two methods to fluorescently label vertebrate GTPases that localize properly: internal tagging with a fluorescent protein and sortase-mediated labeling with a fluorescent dye. This now provides us with widely applicable reagents to analyze GTPase function. These probes faithfully mimic the distribution of the endogenous GTPases based on their comparison to activity reporters in several processes: cell wound repair, cytokinesis, junctional integrity and epithelial wound repair. Further, the successful rescue of Rho function at wounds in the presence of C3 by a C3-insensitive mutant of IT-Rho indicates that these proteins are capable of replacing their endogenous counterparts. It will be important to assess the ability of IT- or Cy3-labeled GTPases to substitute for their endogenous counterparts in other cellular processes in the future via gene replacement approaches, although we note that IT-Cdc42 has been shown to be functional in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendezú et al., 2015</xref>). In any case, the combination of the two labeling approaches is powerful as it permits side-by-side comparison of results obtained in vivo and in vitro, as demonstrated here.</p><p>Visualization of labeled RhoGTPases in combination with activity reporters in living cells led to an unexpected observation: pools of inactive Cdc42 at the plasma membrane. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that inactive GTPases have been detected on membranes under conditions other than gross GTPase overexpression. Notably, the pool of inactive Cdc42 spatially coincides with a local Cdc42-GAP, Abr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vaughan et al., 2011</xref>). This pool of inactive Cdc42 expands with overexpression of Abr, further demonstrating that locally-inactivated Cdc42 can remain associated with the plasma membrane. This finding has important mechanistic implications for the regulation of GTPase activity. Namely, it suggests that GTP hydrolysis and extraction of GTPases, while they are likely linked, are not necessarily tightly coupled. This raises the possibility that GTPases might cycle through multiple rounds of activation and inactivation by GEFs and GAPs while remaining associated with the membrane.</p><p>Remarkably, in addition to the RhoGTPases themselves, GDI also localized to the plasma membrane in proximity to wounds. The localization of GDI in the same place where the GTPases are especially abundant implies that its accumulation reflects interaction with is GTPase clients. It will be important to investigate the detailed mechanism of GDI localization and the control of its turnover at sites of high GTPase activity in the future.</p><p>The most significant result of this study is that RhoGDI can extract active GTPase in vivo, particularly active Cdc42 during cell wound repair. This finding is based on two complementary lines of evidence. First, in vitro assays show that GDI directly extracts active GTPases from supported lipid bilayers. This ability is shared between GDI orthologs from distinct species and can be robustly observed for different GTPase mutants trapped in an active configuration (G12/14V and Q61/63L). Their moderate differences in extraction kinetics might nonetheless be biologically meaningful. Previous studies suggest that Q61/63L variants interact more weakly with GDI compared to their G12/14V counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hodgson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaelson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pertz et al., 2006</xref>); we observe a similar trend concerning membrane extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Second, we also demonstrate extraction of active GTPase in vivo. WT, but not GDI-QQ, extracts Cdc42(G12V) and GTPɣS-Cdc42 from the plasma membrane. These results support previous findings that GDI binds both inactive and active GTPase with relatively high affinity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hancock and Hall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hart et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nomanbhoy and Cerione, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tnimov et al., 2012</xref>). Although we report greater extraction of inactive versus active GTPase, we demonstrate that the extraction of active GTPase is important for their spatiotemporal patterning during cell wound repair. We thus conclude that GDI has the capacity to extract active GTPases and that this ability is harnessed to limit the level of Cdc42 activity during cell wound repair.</p><p>This finding has the virtue of explaining previous results in the oocyte cell wound repair system. Based on an indirect approach involving photoactivatable Rho and Cdc42 activity reporters, it was found that Cdc42 activity is lost throughout its zone, while Rho activity is preferentially lost at the trailing edge of its zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burkel et al., 2012</xref>). The results presented here suggest that GDI is responsible for the removal of active Cdc42 throughout the Cdc42 zone, while Rho is inactivated by a trailing edge GAP prior to extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). This may also explain why a mild overexpression of GDI significantly reduced Cdc42 activity but had no effect on Rho activity: loss of active Cdc42 can be controlled at the level of GDI while Rho inactivation is controlled at the level of a GAP. However, there is an alternative explanation for why the expression of GDI-QQ causes an increase in Cdc42 activity but not Rho activity: while GDI-QQ is utterly deficient in extraction of active Cdc42, it retains a modest ability to extract active Rho (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The broader implications of RhoGDI’s ability to extract active GTPase are two-fold. First, it suggests that a new branch should be added to the canonical GTPase cycle in which active GTPase can directly extracted from the plasma membrane by GDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Further, because GDI binding strongly inhibits GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hart et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ueda et al., 2001</xref>), active GTPase may exist in its soluble form in complex with GDI. However, complementary evidence from biochemical and biological studies suggest that active GTPases are less stably bound to GDI compared to their inactive form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hodgson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Slaughter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tnimov et al., 2012</xref>). As such, this secondary extraction branch may actually represent a loop through which active GTPases are not only removed from cell membranes, but rapidly returned to them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Such a mechanism might enhance the spatial reach of GTPase activity within the plasma membrane or even mediate its spreading between different membrane compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palamidessi et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Schematic of proposed update to RhoGTPase cycle.</title><p>We propose that in addition to the canonical GTPase cycle, GDI can extract active GTPase from the plasma membrane.

Conversely, the Rho zone is shaped by inactivation as it is subject to RhoGAPs 1/8 at the trailing edge of its zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davenport, 2016</xref>).

While the field primarily studies local GTPase regulation at the level of GEFs and GAPs, we should reconsider GDI’s role in regulation, as well as the regulation of GDI itself. Consistent with this idea, several studies have reported that the differential phosphorylation of GDI promotes global increases in the activity of Rho, Rac or Cdc42 by modulating the affinity of GDI for different GTPases (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia-Mata et al., 2011</xref>). The results presented here suggest that it will be of considerable interest to assess the potential for phosphorylation and GDI-dependent regulation on a local level. Indeed, results from empirical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>) and modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holmes et al., 2016</xref>) studies not only indicate that different isoforms of protein kinases C act at different regions around cell wounds, but also have different impacts on Rho and Cdc42 activity zones. When taken with the results of this current study, a picture emerges in which a high level of precision in GTPase patterning is achieved by a complex regulatory network comprising kinases, GEFs, GAPs, and GDI.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The active RhoGTPase probes, mRFP-wGBD, eGFP-wGBD, eGFP-2xrGBD, BFP-2xrGBD and mRFP-2xrGBD in pCS2+ were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sokac et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benink and Bement, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davenport et al., 2016</xref>). mCh-Rho, mCh-Rac, mCh-Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benink, 2005</xref>), untagged Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (wild-type (WT) and constitutively-active (G14/2V)) in pCS2+ were made as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benink and Bement, 2005</xref>).

Data from wash off experiments were fitted with a one component exponential decay function (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>= y offset, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>=amplitude, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>=exponential decay constant), choosing a fitting range that did not include the initial overshoot.

role of Rho-GDIs in regulating Rho GTPase signaling. GDIs are relatively understudied compared to GEFs and GAPs and this work helps us better understand how the Rho cycle is regulated in time and space. There has long been a debate about the role of Rho-GDIs in regulating Rho family GTPases. Classically, the model has been that Rho-GDIs extract inactive Rho proteins from membranes and sequester them in the cytosol. The authors here challenge that model, and present a series of straightforward experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and in vitro that indicate a more complex role for these proteins. Using new tools such as internally tagged small GTPases and GDI mutants that cannot extract small GTPases, the authors find that i) inactive GTPases also reside at the plasma membrane, and not just in a soluble pool bound to Rho-GDI; ii) that GDI differentially suppress active Cdc42 versus Rho; that GDI can extract active GTPases from the membrane; and that, in extraction deficient mutants, levels of active Cdc42 are elevated in vivo, confirming a physiological role, at least in this system. As a result of these experiments, we will need to revise the standard textbook models of Rho GTPase cycling, which, in turn, will make us rethink how cells regulate shape and motility in response to external signals and to internal programs.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Extraction of active RhoGTPases by RhoGDI regulates spatiotemporal patterning of RhoGTPases&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

That is particular so because, even in this work, the degree to which Rho-GDIs extract active GTPases is far less than that of inactive GTPases. Therefore, the overall model represents more of an important tweak than a revolution in modeling Rho cycling dynamics.

If this experiment isn't technically feasible, I would accept their current evidence as sufficient.</p><p>3) To establish the relative localization of Rho-GDI and the GTPases (active pools), the authors should perform line-scans on wound sites like in Figure 4 and report the distance between the peaks for a population of observed cells/wounds.</p><p>4) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1, the authors should discuss what they see. I see that the mCherry-Cdc42 zone is a bit larger than the active Cdc42 zone. For RhoA, I am surprised because I cannot see a clear difference by eye. The line-scan is meaningless because of the low SNR. Please discuss this point. One would need a fully orthogonal method to really decide which of the fusion protein is functional. Immunostaining would be the method of choice, but it is known that antibodies (raised to the C-term hypervariable region) are often of only low quality. I do not have a problem that IT-GTPase constructs are good markers of Rho GTPase localization.</p><p>5) Figure 5C: The authors make a strong point that GDI affects Cdc42 more robustly than RhoA. To support this point, a statistical analysis will be needed.</p><p>6) The authors use RhoA and Cdc42 (Q63/Q61L) mutants in their biochemical assays. They mention that G12/G14V RhoA and Cdc42 mutants work equally well. I would show that data. The work of Michaelson (Michaelson et al., 2001) clearly shows that G12/G14V Cdc42/Rho mutants retain GDI interactions in cells, whereas Q61/Q63L Cdc42/Rho mutants do not. Experiments with a RhoA biosensor shows that Q63L RhoA biosensors are inactivatable with GDI overexpression, whereas this is not the case with the Q63L mutation (Pertz et al., 2006). I would expect that the G12/G14V Cdc42/Rho mutants interact in a different fashion with GDI than their Q61/Q63L counterparts. These issues do not necessarily require new experiments, but will require adjustments to the Discussion.</p><p>7) Given the provocative possibility that there might be different molecular requirement for different spatio-temporal patterns (e.g. Rho and Cdc42 zones), I would strongly suggest that the authors perform an experiment with photoactivatable biosensors to measure the directional GTPase flux in response to the GDI perturbations (overexpression of WT and mutant). This would add greatly to the paper.</p><p>8) The paper would benefit from a discussion about the complexity of spatio-temporal Rho GTPase signaling, to address the following &quot;big picture&quot; points: Where is the field going? What needs to be done? I would also highlight the complexity of these signaling networks, with the requirement of the zone initiation/maintenance being different for Rho and Cdc42 (as depicted in Figure 10—figure supplement 1). Further it would be good to mention that Rho GTPase -GDI interactions can be regulated by phosphorylation: both at the level of the GTPase (RhoA is phosphorylated by PKA at its C-term – this regulates GDI interaction PMID: 8599934), and at the level of GDI (by phosphorylation by PAK PMID: 15225553, or Src PMID: 16943322). These phosphorylation events might provide feedback regulation (by Rho GTPase or adhesion signaling) to spatially fine tune the system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50471.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One general criticism of this work is that the results, though convincing, seem somewhat oversold.

Our intention was to point out that in the textbook model of RhoGTPase cycling, GDI is thought to extract GTPases solely after GAP-dependent inactivation. However, the manner in which the original introduction was written might lead people to believe that the idea of active GTPase extraction by GDI had never been previously suggested. We have therefore rewritten the Introduction to make it clear that some earlier data shows that GDI can interact with active GTPases and that others previously suggested the possibility that this interaction might result in extraction. Specifically, we have added the following sentence to the Introduction: &quot;However, work by several labs has shown that GDIs bind both inactive and active GTPases with relatively high affinity in vitro(Hancock and Hall, 1993; Hart et al., 1992; Nomanbhoy and Cerione, 1996; Tnimov et al., 2012), leading to the suggestion that GDIs interact with active as well as inactive GTPases in vivo&quot;. To further clarify this point, we have added the following to the end of the Introduction: &quot;Using these tools, we identify co-existing pools of active and inactive GTPases associated with the plasma membrane and provide additional evidence that GDI can extract both inactive and active GTPases in vitro, as suggested by previous steady-state affinity measurements (Hancock and Hall, 1993; Leonard et al., 1992; Nomanbhoy and Cerione, 1996; Tnimov et al., 2012)&quot;.</p><p>As a further means to avoid &quot;overselling&quot;, we removed the clause &quot;While these findings might seem heretical&quot; from the Discussion paragraph that now begins &quot;This finding has the virtue…&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Assuming that appropriate antibodies are available, In Figures 1 and 2, it would be useful to get a sense of relative levels of exogenous versus endogenous Rho and Cdc42, respectively. The authors mention potential issues related to overexpression and it would be good to know how much exogenous GTPase is being introduced into the oocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another good point. We have calculated the relative level of exogenous vs. endogenous Rho and Cdc42 for the Cy3-labeled GTPases using the proteomic data from Wuhr et al., 2014, for <italic>X. laevis</italic> eggs. For Cy3-Rho, the concentration used in this study results in a 41% increase above endogenous levels. For Cy3-Cdc42, the concentration used in this study results in a 52% increase above endogenous levels. Importantly, the microinjected Cy3-GTPases are bound to GDI, so there is presumably no danger of disrupting the GDI-GTPase balance, which can lead to GTPase aggregation and degradation (see Boulter et al., 2010). This information has been added to the Results section (paragraph three).</p><p>For the internally-tagged (IT) GTPases, more effort was needed. Unfortunately, available antibodies for Rho and Cdc42 do not work well in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system. Instead, we used the following strategy: oocytes microinjected with mRNA encoding IT-Rho (GFP), at the same concentration used for imaging throughout the paper, were homogenized and whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE alongside standard curve of purified GFP-UtrCH 261 (Burkel et al., 2007). The blot was probed with an anti-GFP antibody. The results obtained showed that the concentration of IT-GFP-Rho mRNA microinjected in this study results in a 36% increase above endogenous Rho levels. As with the Cy3-labeled GTPases, the IT GTPases are co-expressed with low concentrations of GDI mRNA to avoid disrupting the GDI-GTPases balance. This information has been added to the Results (paragraph two) and Materials and methods (subsections “Oocyte microinjection” and “Quantification of IT-Rho expression level in <italic>X. laevis</italic>oocyte”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given that Q61L/Q63 forms of these GTPases are unable to cleave GTP, yet still (by the author's model) can be extracted by Rho-GDI, I would like to see a simple assay showing that such complexes (e.g. Cdc42 L61:Rho-GDI) can be isolated from the cytosol by IP. If this experiment isn't technically feasible, I would accept their current evidence as sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it would be ideal to provide additional evidence for the existence of soluble complexes between GDI and active GTPases in the cytosol. However, based on our biochemical understanding of the interaction between GDI and its GTPase clients, we would not anticipate these complexes to be sufficiently stable to allow for isolation via immunoprecipitation. As part of a separate project, we have investigated this aspect in biophysical detail. Both inactive and active GTPases interact with GDI with sub-micromolar affinity, indicating that complexes should exist at physiological protein concentrations. However, the dissociation rates of GDI from either inactive (GDP-bound) or active (GTP-bound, Q61L) Cdc42 differ by more than two orders of magnitude (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). GTP-bound Cdc42(Q61L) releases GDI with half-lives of less than 10s, showing that the complex should be expected to fall apart during the inevitable dilution and the repeated wash steps required for IP.</p><p>Nonetheless, we tried to address this point by microinjecting either Cy3-labeled Q61L Cdc42 or, as a negative control, Cy3-Cdc42 R66E (a mutant which does not interact with GDI). Cells were homogenized, mixed with purified FLAG-GDI, and coupled to a FLAG affinity resin for precipitation. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred and blotted with a commercially obtained anti-Cy3 antibody. Unfortunately, the antibody recognized a number of proteins, most of which were too large to be GDI.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Dissociation of either GTP-loaded, Cy3-Cdc42 (Q61L) (yellow) or GDP-loaded Cy3-Cdc42 (WT) from Alexa647-RhoGDI after addition of excess unlabeled RhoGDI at t=0 as monitored by FRET..</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50471-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To establish the relative localization of Rho-GDI and the GTPases (active pools), the authors should perform line-scans on wound sites like in Figure 4 and report the distance between the peaks for a population of observed cells/wounds.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very useful suggestion. We have performed additional triple-label experiments and now display the information obtained from them in revised Figure 4A,B, which includes both a radially-averaged kymograph and quantification of the results obtained from multiple cells. The data show that the peak of GDI signal consistently lags behind the peak of Rho signal, which supports the notion that GDI may differentially regulate Cdc42 and Rho in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure1—figure supplement 1, the authors should discuss what they see. I see that the mCherry-Cdc42 zone is a bit larger than the active Cdc42 zone. For RhoA, I am surprised because I cannot see a clear difference by eye. The line-scan is meaningless because of the low SNR. Please discuss this point. One would need a fully orthogonal method to really decide which of the fusion protein is functional. Immunostaining would be the method of choice, but it is known that antibodies (raised to the C-term hypervariable region) are often of only low quality. I do not have a problem that IT-GTPase constructs are good markers of Rho GTPase localization.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point to address. Put simply, relative to the IT-GTPases, the N-terminally FP-tagged GTPases show either very faint recruitment to wounds, very broad recruitment to wounds, or both. We have therefore added text to this effect to the Results: &quot;Specifically, the zones of recruitment defined by amino-terminally tagged GTPases are much less focused and much less intense than those obtained with either the activity reporters or the internally tagged GTPases (Figure 1—figure supplement 1; see below for functional analysis)&quot;.</p><p>We have also increased the signal on the image in the supplemental figure to make it clearer how different it is from the IT-GTPase. In addition, to address this point, we have also included references that have reported that Rho tagged N-terminally with a fluorescent protein fails to concentrate at the cleavage furrow in human cells and added additional references to document that amino terminal-tagging of RhoGTPases with fluorescent proteins impairs their localization and function (Introduction paragraph four and Results paragraph one).</p><p>Most importantly, we have directly tested the ability of C3-insensitive, amino-terminally GFP-tagged Rho to rescue Rho activation at wounds in C3 injected cells. In contrast to the C3-insensitive IT-Rho, the N-terminally-tagged version failed to rescue Rho activity at wounds in C3-injected cells. These data have been added to Figure 2H, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and are discussed in the Results section (paragraph five).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5C: The authors make a strong point that GDI affects Cdc42 more robustly than RhoA. To support this point, a statistical analysis will be needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed and added statistical analyses that show that very low level (~15%) overexpression of both <italic>Xenopus</italic> (Figure 5C,D)) and bovine (Figure 5—figure supplement 2) RhoGDI significantly reduces Cdc42 activity but not Rho activity at wounds. These findings are described in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors use RhoA and Cdc42 (Q63/Q61L) mutants in their biochemical assays. They mention that G12/G14V RhoA and Cdc42 mutants work equally well. I would show that data. The work of Michaelson (Michaelson et al., 2001) clearly shows that G12/G14V Cdc42/Rho mutants retain GDI interactions in cells, whereas Q61/Q63L Cdc42/Rho mutants do not. Experiments with a RhoA biosensor shows that Q63L RhoA biosensors are inactivatable with GDI overexpression, whereas this is not the case with the Q63L mutation (Pertz et al., 2006). I would expect that the G12/G14V Cdc42/Rho mutants interact in a different fashion with GDI than their Q61/Q63L counterparts. These issues do not necessarily require new experiments, but will require adjustments to the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that these references suggest that GDI interacts differently with G12/14V and Q61/63L variants in cells. Whether this is due to i) these mutations differentially weakening GDI binding directly or ii) indirect effects resulting from the differences in nucleotide states these variants assume in the cytoplasm is not known. The former possibility motivated us to directly compare these two variants more carefully in additional in vitroexperiments.</p><p>Our previous data suggested that G12/14V and Q61/63L variants behave similarly in our membrane extraction assay. However, we knew that our G12/14V data was compromised by i) incomplete nucleotide exchange and ii) the continual hydrolysis of during the long overall duration of the experiment, resulting in a mix of nucleotide states. We have now improved the assay by exchanging the nucleotide directly and more completely before each membrane extraction reaction, thereby eliminating the confounding issue of mixed nucleotide states.</p><p>This new data confirms that active, GTPγS-loaded G12/14V GTPases are also potently extracted by RhoGDI. In fact, extraction is even more rapid compared to the corresponding Q61/Q63L variants. We draw two important conclusions from this data: i) extraction of active GTPases is a robust feature of GDI that we observe for distinct constitutively-active GTPase variants and among GDI orthologs, strengthening one of our central conclusions; ii) G12/14V and Q61/63L variants differ moderately in their ability to interact with GDI on membranes.</p><p>The latter point is important, because we find that our extraction-deficient GDI mutant (GDI-QQ) retains residual activity in extracting GTPγS-loaded G14V, but not GTP-loaded Q63L Rho. This offers an alternative interpretation of the differential effects of GDI-QQ overexpression on Rho versus Cdc42 activity around wounds. GDI-QQ might still be able to attenuate Rho, but not Cdc42 activity by direct extraction.</p><p>We have added the new data to Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 7—figure supplement 3 and discuss these findings now in detail in the Results and Discussion sections of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Given the provocative possibility that there might be different molecular requirement for different spatio-temporal patterns (e.g. Rho and Cdc42 zones), I would strongly suggest that the authors perform an experiment with photoactivatable biosensors to measure the directional GTPase flux in response to the GDI perturbations (overexpression of WT and mutant). This would add greatly to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>While we would like to perform such experiments, they are far, far beyond the scope of the current work both in terms of added material and added time. With respect to added material, conducting flux experiments would add at least two new figures and another set of concepts to be digested by the readers. We believe that what is already contained in our manuscript represents a complete study both conceptually and in terms of the amount of information. The study in its current form contains extensive, parallel in vivoand in vitroexperiments, it reveals several unexpected and exciting features of GTPase cycling, and it introduces and characterizes new tools and approaches.</p><p>With respect to time, it is unfortunately not just &quot;an experiment&quot;, rather it would be a minimum of 12 experiments: 6X for control groups, WT GDI expression groups, QQ GDI expression versus photoactivatable GFP-rGBD (PA-GFP-rGBD) to monitor Rho activity flux, and then 6X of each of those with PA-GFP-wGBD to monitor Cdc42 flux. The reason six replicates are required is because the photoactivation experiments are much harder than those that just require wounding since the investigator has to aim and fire a 405nm laser at the wound repeatedly as it closes. This means not only hitting the right places around the wound, but also firing at exactly the right focal plane. It takes practice, and even with practice, it is hard to get more than a few good runs in a 3-hour time slot on the microscope. In addition, the photoactivatable activity sensors express slowly in some batches of cells and very slowly in others (apparently due to slow folding of the mutant GFP). Thus, we often have to wait two days after mRNA expression for sufficient signal to conduct an experiment. This was challenging enough in the original work (Burkel et al., 2012) which took us 6 years to finish. While we are more proficient with the photoactivatable probes than when we started using them, combining them with the GDI mutants would add another level of difficulty. That is, trying to work out the details for control vs WT GDI vs QQ GDI vs. PA-GFP-rGBD expression as well as the details for control vs WT GDI vs QQ GDI vs. PA-GFP-wGBD alone would likely require several months.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The paper would benefit from a discussion about the complexity of spatio-temporal Rho GTPase signaling, to address the following &quot;big picture&quot; points: Where is the field going? What needs to be done? I would also highlight the complexity of these signaling networks, with the requirement of the zone initiation/maintenance being different for Rho and Cdc42 (as depicted in Figure 10—figure supplement 1). Further it would be good to mention that Rho GTPase -GDI interactions can be regulated by phosphorylation: both at the level of the GTPase (RhoA is phosphorylated by PKA at its C-term – this regulates GDI interaction PMID: 8599934), and at the level of GDI (by phosphorylation by PAK PMID: 15225553, or Src PMID: 16943322). These phosphorylation events might provide feedback regulation (by Rho GTPase or adhesion signaling) to spatially fine tune the system.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent idea. We have expanded the Discussion to point out the potential impact of phosphorylation on GDI-based extraction, with a particular emphasis on phosphorylation of GDI itself and precise, local patterning of GTPases by kinase-dependent regulation of GDI working in concert with GEFs and GAPs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
