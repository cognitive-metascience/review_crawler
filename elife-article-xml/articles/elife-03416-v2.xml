T cells (Teff) driving ongoing immune pathology. Using CD4<sup>+</sup> autoimmune Teff cells, we demonstrate that peptide immunotherapy (PIT) is strictly dependent upon sustained T cell expression of the co-inhibitory molecule PD-1. We found high levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at the PD-1 (<italic>Pdcd1</italic>) promoter of non-tolerant T cells. 5hmC was lost in response to PIT, with DNA hypomethylation of the promoter. We identified dynamic changes in expression of the genes encoding the Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) proteins that are associated with the oxidative conversion 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC, during cytosine demethylation. We describe a model whereby promoter demethylation requires the co-incident expression of permissive histone modifications at the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter together with TET availability. This combination was only seen in tolerant Teff cells following PIT, but not in Teff that transiently express PD-1. Epigenetic changes at the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> locus therefore determine the tolerizing potential of TCR-ligation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03416.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03416.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03416.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system protects the body from dangerous microbes and removes damaged cells. However, in some cases, the immune system can malfunction and attack healthy tissues, which can lead to type-1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and other autoimmune diseases. Many of the current treatments for these disorders suppress the immune system, which can make the individuals more susceptible to infections.</p><p>It may be possible to treat autoimmune diseases using small pieces of protein—called peptides—that are based on proteins found on the cells that the immune system attacks by mistake. This strategy would target the specific immune cells that are malfunctioning, but allow the rest of the immune system to continue to work as normal. Peptide-based therapies for autoimmune diseases are currently being tested in clinical trials, and although the results look promising, it is not known precisely how they work.</p><p>McPherson et al. used mice that develop a disease similar to multiple sclerosis because some of their immune cells, known as effector T cells, attack a protein found in the mouse brain called MBP. The mice were treated with a peptide based on part of MBP, which prevented them from developing the autoimmune disease. The success of the peptide therapy depended on the T cells producing large amounts of a protein called PD-1. This protein stops the T-cells from activating immune responses when they detect the MBP protein.</p><p>The gene that makes PD-1 can have a methyl-tag—a chemical modification to DNA—which alters how much PD-1 is made in the T cells. When the gene has this methyl-tag, it can only be switched on for a short time to make a small amount of PD-1, which helps to control the immune responses activated by the T cell. However, when the methyl-tag was removed as a result of the peptide therapy the gene could be switched on for much longer, so that much more PD-1 was produced.</p><p>This work helps us to understand how peptide therapy works and should improve the chances of using this therapy to successfully treat patients with autoimmune diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03416.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03416.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>immune tolerance</kwd><kwd>t cell</kwd><kwd>PD-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0801924, G1100084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McPherson</surname><given-names>Rhoanne C</given-names></name><name><surname>Leech</surname><given-names>Melanie D</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderton</surname><given-names>Stephen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>087833</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderton</surname><given-names>Stephen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000381</institution-id><institution>Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>899/08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McPherson</surname><given-names>Rhoanne C</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderton</surname><given-names>Stephen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Peptide immunotherapy in mice depends upon sustained expression of co-inhibitory protein PD-1 in T cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antigen-based immunotherapy remains the ‘holy grail’ of immune tolerance because it should target only those pathogenic lymphocytes driving autoimmune, allergic, or alloreactive immunopathology, whilst leaving beneficial immune surveillance unaltered. Peptide immunotherapy (PIT) is the subject of clinical trials in autoimmune and allergic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larche and Wraith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larché, 2007</xref>). Despite this the molecular basis for effects of PIT, particularly on T effector (Teff) cells, which is the clinical imperative, remains to be fully understood.</p><p>The co-inhibitory receptor PD-1 (encoded by the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> locus) is transiently upregulated on both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells upon activation in order to restrain primary immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agata et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keir et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2008</xref>). Its role in maintaining peripheral tolerance under steady state conditions is illustrated by the spontaneous development of autoimmune pathology in mice that lack PD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishimura et al., 1999</xref>). PD-1 is also highly-expressed on exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Youngblood et al., 2013</xref>). PD-1 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-switch motif (ITSM) that is thought to recruit SHP-2, a phosphatase that can inhibit the PI3K pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chemnitz et al., 2004</xref>). Signalling through PD-1 upon TCR stimulation has been shown to inhibit proliferation and the production of IL-2 and effector cytokines by T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sandner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keir et al., 2006</xref>). The importance of PD-1 signalling in PIT has been unclear. Reversal of unresponsiveness has been reported in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells upon blockade of PD-1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsushima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chikuma et al., 2009</xref>), but PD-1 was dispensable for both the induction and maintenance of tolerance in PIT-exposed naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Konkel et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the clinical setting, PIT is required to control activated Teff cells during ongoing inflammation. Although PIT has been reported to reverse clinical signs of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leech et al., 2007</xref>), this scenario has been seldom explored mechanistically. An understanding of this is clearly of major importance to successful clinical translation. Here we used a peptide of myelin basic protein (MBP) and MBP-responsive TCR transgenic cells to show that PIT was capable of silencing Teff cells, thereby preventing murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). PD-L1<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DC) were uniquely capable of providing sustained presentation of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes following PIT. PD-1-deficient T cells were resistant to PIT. In PD-1-sufficient Teff, PIT drove demethylation of the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter, correlating with loss of 5-hydroxymethylation (a potential DNA demethylation intermediate) and lasting PD-1 expression. These data help define an epigenetic signature of T cell tolerance following PIT and therefore have implications for the development of protein biomarkers for clinical efficacy in current and anticipated tolerogenic modalities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Non-deletional tolerance in response to PIT</title><p>The Ac1-9(4Tyr) peptide of MBP, containing a Lys→Tyr substitution at residue 4 of the peptide, is a potent tolerogen when administered in soluble form either to wildtype (WT) H-2<sup>u</sup> mice or to Tg4 mice expressing a transgenic TCR responsive to this peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Wraith, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhart et al., 1999</xref>). To trace a defined antigen-responsive cohort of T cells we adapted these protocols by prior transfer of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> Tg4.CD45.1 T cells into B10.PL (H-2<sup>u</sup>), or B10.PLxC57BL/6 (H-2<sup>u,b</sup>) mice. These F<sub>1</sub> mice are resistant to EAE induced with the MBP peptide, unless first seeded with a cohort of Tg4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ryan et al., 2005</xref>). Tracing the presence and function of the transferred Tg4 cells is therefore of direct relevance as they are the pathogenic T cell population in these experiments. A single i.v. injection of the MBP peptide protected against subsequent efforts to induce EAE by immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Donor T cells persisted in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), but there was reduced production of IFN-γ and IL-17, in splenic recall assays amongst PIT-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of note, we found no evidence for an elevation in the frequency of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> donor Tg4 cells, nor in IL-10 production in response to PIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We concluded from these initial studies that a single exposure to the MBP peptide was sufficient for successful PIT, without enhanced induction of cell death, or establishment of Treg-mediated suppression, but rather an intrinsic unresponsiveness in the persisting Tg4 cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03416.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PIT induces unresponsiveness in naïve Tg4 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) B10.PLxC57BL/6 mice received PBS or PIT i.v. 1 day after transfer of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> Tg4 cells.

This, coupled with pMHC presentation specifically by PD-L1<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> DC renders the T cells unable to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. To determine the functional importance of PD-1 in this tolerogenic process, we generated Tg4.PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Transferred naïve Tg4 cells from these mice were insensitive to PIT, going on to cause a typical course of EAE upon subsequent immunization that was indistinguishable from that induced with Tg4.PD-1<sup>+/+</sup> cells that had not been subjected to PIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

A consequence of this overall increase in the number of Tg4.PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> Teff cells was increased numbers of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells as well as cytokine<sup>+</sup> cells in this group. However, as seen with Tg4.PD-1<sup>+/+</sup> Teff cells, the frequencies of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> or cytokine<sup>+</sup> Tg4.PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> Teff cells were reduced following PIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 2,3</xref>).

The deficit in CD25-upregulation seen in PIT-treated Tg4.PD-1<sup>+/+</sup> Teff cells was reflected by a low frequency of cells with phosphorylated STAT5 in response to IL-2. Notably however, PIT-treated Tg4.PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> Teff cells did not show such abrogated STAT5 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>).

In contrast, PIT drove the long-term expression of PD-1 by potentially pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and this was a required component of PIT.

In naïve Tg4 cells and PBS-treated Tg4 Teff cells (neither of which expressed PD-1), neither modification (H3K27me3 or H3K4me3) was enriched at the two conserved regions, CR-B and CR-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Youngblood et al., 2011</xref>), of the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>).

We retrieved Tg4 cells at various stages of the Teff PIT model for DNA methylation analysis. DNA modification was quantified, after bisulfite conversion, using pyrosequencing to assess individual CpG sites within the whole cell population. Cloning and sequencing after bisulfite conversion provided complementary information on the pattern of DNA methylation at CpG sites across individual cloned alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Consistent with previous analyses of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Youngblood et al., 2011</xref>), CpGs within the CR-B region were largely modified (∼80% methylation across most CpG sites) in naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> Tg4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>), whereas DNA methylation levels were considerably lower across the CR-C region. Despite expression of PD-1 by Tg4 Teff cells on the day of transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), there were no differences in DNA methylation at the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter of these pathogenic cells compared to naïve Tg4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>), indicating that demethylation is not a pre-requisite for transient PD-1 expression following initial CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. As would be expected based on this result, DNA methylation was maintained at CR-B and CR-C in the Teff cells retrieved from PBS-treated hosts, where PD-1 expression had returned to levels observed in naïve T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In marked contrast, PIT-exposed Teff, which had prolonged PD-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–F</xref>), showed complete demethylation at CR-C and significantly reduced DNA methylation at the CR-B region in the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>).

A role for PD-1 in the establishment, or maintenance, of T cell unresponsiveness has been reported in various experimental models of autoimmune and allergic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Probst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Francisco et al., 2010</xref>). Our previous work had excluded such a role for PD-1 in PIT-driven tolerance for naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, because PIT remained effective irrespective of antibody blockade or genetic deletion of PD-1 in the peptide-responsive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Konkel et al., 2010</xref>). In the two experimental models used in that study, PIT appeared to drive the abortive activation and apoptosis of peptide-responsive naïve T cells within 4 days, which would override any potential for PD-1-mediated long-term unresponsiveness. In contrast to those previous studies using naïve T cells, we found here that Teff persisted following therapeutic application of PIT. In a recent study using PIT to silence allergic airways inflammation, we found an analogous accumulation of allergic Teff cells, indicating that persistence following PIT is common to Teff with different inflammatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackenzie et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The observations that pMHC complexes were specifically maintained on CD4<sup>+</sup> DC in vivo, and that these DC showed the highest constitutive expression of PD-L1, led us to assess the role of PD-1 in PIT here. A recent study transgenically expressed autoantigen on all DC subsets and found PD-1-dependent elevation in the frequencies of autoreactive Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yogev et al., 2012</xref>). That result may well have reflected an influence of CD8<sup>+</sup> DC, which can drive de novo Foxp3–expression due to their production of TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamazaki et al., 2008</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> DC do not have that capacity, accounting for the absence of increased Foxp3-expression here, in Tg4 cells exposed to PIT. This, together with the lack of evidence for IL-10 production in response to PIT suggests that, in this study, the predominant effect of PIT is to suppress pathogenic effector function rather than to drive gain of regulatory function.</p><p>PD-1 has been reported to co-locate to TCR microclusters at the immunological synapse, where, following Lck-mediated phosphorylation of its ITSM, PD-1 recruits the SHP-2 phosphatase to counteract phosphorylation of TCR-proximal signalling machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yokosuka et al., 2012</xref>). Use of Tg4.PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> Teff cells indicated a key role for PD-1 in limiting clonal expansion following PIT. There are several ways in which this inhibition could be achieved. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways can lower cell proliferation by reducing transcription of SKP2. This gene encodes a crucial component of the ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>, which is required for cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activation and cell cycle progression from G1 into S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appleman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patsoukis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pauken et al., 2013</xref>). Exogenous IL-2 only partially restores cell proliferation by activating the MEK/ERK pathway but not the PI3K/Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patsoukis et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that IL-2 cannot reverse PD-1-dependent unresponsiveness. Recruitment SHP-2 to the cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 is thought to function primarily by inhibiting the PI3K pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chemnitz et al., 2004</xref>). However, SHP-2 has also been implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of pSTAT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2003</xref>) and PD-1 signalling has been associated with a decrease in both the expression and phosphorylation of STAT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iliopoulos et al., 2011</xref>). These observations correlate with the decreased levels of pSTAT5 we see in Tg4 Teff cells (with intact PD-1 signalling) following PIT. Furthermore, inactivation of STAT5 can lead to a reduction in cell-surface CD25 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2001</xref>). This, coupled with the inhibition of TCR signalling pathways by PD-1, would likely account for the impaired CD25 expression that we saw in PIT-exposed Tg4 Teff cells. An impaired ability to upregulate CD25, and therefore to respond to IL-2, is distinct from the classical profile for clonal anergy, in which unresponsive T cells can upregulate CD25 but cannot produce their own IL-2 (anergy is broken by addition of exogenous IL-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwartz, 2003</xref>). An unresponsive state that blocks CD25 upregulation can be viewed as more secure, since it removes the risk of IL-2 from a bystander source overcoming that unresponsiveness.</p><p>Consistent with their lack of encephalitogenicity, Teff that had been tolerized by PIT had an impaired ability to establish themselves in the CNS. This might reflect their impaired ability to undergo clonal expansion upon subsequent exposure to MBP in the CNS, as discussed above. A recent report has indicated an additional role for PD-1 in inhibiting autoimmune T cell infiltration into the pancreas in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pauken et al., 2013</xref>). Here we observed that tolerized Teff had lower levels of active PSGL-1 relative to pathogenic T cells (PBS group), which is an important component of pathogenic T cell entry into the CNS in this model. To our knowledge, no direct causal relationship between PD-1 and PSGL-1 has been established. T follicular helper (TFH) cells are PD-1<sup>hi</sup> and PSGL-1<sup>lo</sup> , but we do not believe that PIT drives Teff towards a TFH fate, since we did not observe any production of the TFH-associated cytokine IL-21, nor did we find evidence for any gain of the TFH-associated transcription factor BCL-6 following PIT (data not shown). The transcription factor T-bet can inhibit PD-1 expression in CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kao et al., 2011</xref>), but here we found that this was not the case for CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff cells, which were T-bet<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>hi</sup> following PIT, indicating that T-bet and PD-1 are not necessarily mutually antagonistic.</p><p>Our data allow us to develop a model to explain the pronounced demethylation of the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter that, in the experimental system used here, is a unique characteristic of Tg4 Teff that have been tolerized in response to PIT. The <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter of Tg4 cells in their naïve state appears to be fully methylated, although this includes a significant level of 5-hydroxymethylation. This, together with the availability of TETs 1–3 and the absence of the repressive H3K27me3 histone mark, suggests that the gene is poised for transcriptional activation and PD-1 expression. This would fit with the known early expression of PD-1 following initial TCR ligation (as seen here in Teff on the day of transfer). This PD-1 expression during Teff generation was mirrored by chromatin changes associated with gene transcription (H3K4me3 enrichment), but without a contemporaneous demethylation of the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter. The considerable reduction in TET expression observed at the Teff stage should impede any active demethylation through the oxidation of either 5mC or 5hmC (a process that involves TET activity), thereby averting long-term PD-1 expression that would affect Teff function. As these cells transition to a PD-1-negative Teff state (pathogenic Tg4 cells retrieved from PBS-treated hosts), histone modifications associated with active transcription are no longer evident and, although TET expression has been restored, this repressive chromatin state prevents the TET (and other) proteins from accessing the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter to allow demethylation. However, a key feature of the tolerogenic properties of PIT is to provide long-term PD-1 expression by tolerant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which is associated with the presence of stable histone modifications characteristic of active transcription (thus enabling access of the TET proteins, amongst others), and therefore loss of both 5mC and 5hmC at the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter. These data indicate that analysis of the methylation/hydroxymethylation status of the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoters may facilitate the discrimination of tolerant versus recently activated PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>Juvenile arthritis patients who responded to PIT using peptide from the DNAj antigen were reported to have an ‘immune signature’ that included elevated global PD-1 expression, relative to non-responders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koffeman et al., 2009</xref>). However, that work was based on assessment of the patients before undergoing PIT, rather than following PIT. It would therefore be important to understand the relative expression of PD-1 before and after treatment in individual patients in future studies. A limitation is the need to identify T cells that are relevant to the peptide(s) used for PIT. As the range of pMHC tetramers available expands, this should become more feasible. Furthermore, our study highlights the need for analysis of the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter to discriminate PD-1<sup>hi</sup> pathogenic Teff from the PD-1<sup>hi</sup> Teff rendered tolerant by PIT. This would be challenging to combine with tetramer-based isolation of relatively small T cell populations, although perhaps not impossible. Therefore, whilst locus-specific DNA methylation-status would not prove a viable biomarker in itself, it might aid the identification of a surrogate phenotypic profile amenable to flow cytometric analysis.</p><p>The demethylation of the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter seen in PIT-tolerized Teff is reminiscent of the changes reported to occur in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhausted in response to chronic viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Youngblood et al., 2011</xref>). So, do these two situations of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell tolerance and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion have the same underlying mechanism(s)? In some ways yes, but there are some pronounced differences. In both scenarios Teff cells express PD-1 but this is lost, either as they transition to memory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Youngblood et al., 2011</xref>), or here within 2 days of transfer in the absence of PIT. Conversely, exhausted or peptide-tolerized Teff cells maintain PD-1 expression. Youngblood et al reported that CD8<sup>+</sup> Teff cells that transiently expressed PD-1 already have demethylated <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoters and their transition towards PD-1-negative memory cells is driven by the specific remethylation of their <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Youngblood et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the methylation status of the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoters within our CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff cells that transiently expressed PD-1 appeared unaltered from that of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. It was only in the PIT-treated Teff that we saw significant demethylation of the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter, consistent with their sustained PD-1 expression. It will be important to determine whether these differences reflect intrinsic differences in how PD-1 expression is controlled in CD4<sup>+</sup> versus CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In addition, we are not aware of any information on 5hmC status of the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter in CD8<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p>We found marked enrichment of 5hmC at the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter in naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This is intriguing because the biological significance of 5hmC has chiefly been explored in the context of embryonic development. Its appearance in the promoter of a key gene controlling T cell activation suggests that DNA hydroxymethylation may play a broader role in maintaining the ‘pluripotent’ state of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We suggest that this warrants global analyses to search for 5hmC and other intermediates of 5mC oxidation within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell genome and also for the TET proteins with direct roles in the oxidation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deplus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koh and Rao, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice, antigens and tissue culture medium</title><p>C57BL/6 (CD45.1 or CD45.2), B10.PL (CD45.2), B10.PLxC57BL/6 (CD45.2) and Tg4 (CD45.1 or CD90.1) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 1995</xref>) were used.

Using a peptide of myelin basic protein (MBP) and MBP specific TCR transgenic T cells, they develop a model of non-deletional tolerance to PIT and demonstrate that PD-1 is required for PIT induced unresponsiveness, as PD-1 deficient T cells are resistant to PIT. In further studies they show that PIT sustains PD-1 expression in naïve or effector T cells. Epigenetic studies reveal that PIT leads to demethylation of the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter in tolerized T cells. These findings are of fundamental and translational importance. However, several aspects of the work need to be clarified, and several of the conclusions seem premature from the data presented, as discussed below:</p><p>1) Studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> show that administration of MBP peptide i.v. leads to persistence of Ag-specific donor T cells. Data show that IFN-g and IL-17 production was reduced in splenic recall assays. Is this due to a difference in cytokine production on a per cell basis or the frequency of the cytokine producing cells? How do the percentages (and numbers) of IFN-g and IL-17 producing cells in PIT-treated and control mice compare? Also is there a difference in the frequency of IL-10 producing cells? Is T cell survival affected by PIT in this model?</p><p>2) Studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> show that PIT treatment of recipients of naïve Tg4.PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> T cells do not protect from EAE in contrast to PIT treatment of recipients of Tg4.PD-1<sup>+/+</sup> T cells. This is a key finding that merits deeper analyses. How do Tg4T cell numbers, as well as percentages of FoxP3<sup>+</sup>, IFN-g and IL-17+ Tg4T cells, in the spleen and CNS compare in the PIT treated recipients of Tg4.PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> vs., Tg4.PD-1<sup>+/+</sup> T cells?</p><p>3) Studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> show that PIT can induce tolerance in an EAE transfer model in which Tg4 effector T cells are used. There are marked reductions in the frequencies of splenic IFN-g and GM-CSF producing Tg4 cells. The manuscript would be strengthened by comparisons of the effects of PIT on naïve and Teff cells. Are there similar differences in frequency in IL-17 producing Tg4 cells? How do the total numbers of IFN-g, GM-CSF, and IL-17 producing Tg4 cells compare in PIT and PBS treated mice? Are there any changes in FoxP3<sup>+</sup> frequencies and the Treg/Teff cell ratios in the PIT vs. PBS treated mice?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, the authors should clarify whether PD-1 expression is being examined on spleens after secondary transfer from recipients in which EAE was induced or in mice in which was not induced.

Is the presence of antigen needed to maintain PD-1 expression in PIT treated effector Tg4 cells?</p><p>5) Studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> show that PIT treatment alters DNA methylation patterns at the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter and reduces 5hmC enrichment at the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter CR-B and CR-C regions.

Most importantly, the key novel aspect of this work is that we provide data on the mechanistic basis for PIT induced unresponsiveness in Teff cells, rather than the commonly used naïve T cells.</p><p><italic>Specific comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>, it is not clear how PIT induces high expression of PD-1 in CD4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>T cells</italic>.</p><p>PD-1 is upregulated in response to TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agata et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>We contend in the manuscript, the stable expression of PD-1 is due to epigenetic changes in the <italic>Pdcd1</italic> promoter in response to the TCR stimulation provided by PIT.</p><p><italic>Is it primarily attributed to high expression of PD-L1 by DCs presenting peptide/MHC</italic>?</p><p>We are not arguing that the PD-L1 expressed by DC is important for the sustained PD-1 expression by T cells. It is not clear why such a feedback mechanism would exist. During productive T cell immune responses, T cells transiently express PD-1 and activated DC upregulate PD-L1. Thus, if such a feedback mechanism were possible, sustained PD-1 expression by T cells might ensue during normal immunity, which is not seen and would clearly be undesirable. Rather, we propose that the constitutive expression of PD-L1 by CD4<sup>+</sup> DC allows them to provide a dominant negative signal to the T cells, by ligating PD-1.</p><p><italic>If so, how does PIT induce high PD-L1 in DCs</italic>?</p><p>We have no evidence that PIT induces high PD-L1 in DC.</p><p>Please note that the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D and E</xref> are from analyses of steady state DC (i.e. from mice that had not received PIT). This level of PDL-1 was not increased by administration of peptide using the PIT protocol (data not shown). Thus the key point is that CD4<sup>+</sup> DC have constitutively high expression of PD-L1. This is in fact evident (but not considered/discussed) in other published reports (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yogev et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We therefore conclude that the PIT effect is driven by soluble peptide being concentrated on these DC (as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The mechanism for this concentration is unknown, but clearly this DC population merits further investigation as the reviewer suggests below.</p><p><italic>Can peptide/MHC-expressing PD-L1+ DCs induce anergy in transgenic CD4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>T cells in vitro? Does transfer of such peptide-pulsed PD-L1-high DCs induce PD-1-high anergic T cells in vivo</italic>?</p><p>As you will appreciate, the CD4<sup>+</sup> DC population is quite a rare fraction within the total splenic mononuclear population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> of the manuscript). However, we agree that we should attempt to discern any inherent “tolerogenic” function of these cells after their isolation.</p><p>Suggested experiments:</p><p>It is unclear whether we can isolate sufficient numbers for in vivo transfers. We therefore propose to address whether these cells can influence Tg4 Teff function in vitro. If this is successful, we will endeavour to perform in vivo transfers. Though they will likely require large mouse numbers for DC donors, these experiments would not be long-term and could be completed in a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>We should point out that there is one important caveat that makes it quite unclear whether we will in fact see any “tolerogenic” effect using isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> DC. This is that DC have the propensity to become activated during their isolation ex vivo, upregulating costimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86 and CD40 (Schlecht et al., 2006; Vremec et al., 2011).</p><p>We cannot therefore be certain that the functional status of these DC in vitro will reflect that displayed in their steady state in vivo. Relevant to this, we used isolated DC populations to stimulate the proliferation of a Tg4 cell line (which are essentially Teff) to identify CD4<sup>+</sup> DC as the APC fraction that holds peptide-MHC complexes after peptide administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that these cells may have been partially activated during the purification process.</p><p>Therefore, although we can perform the additional experiments that we describe above, at this point we cannot predict how this well-established confounding effect of DC isolation will influence the results.</p><p>UPDATE: We performed a series of experiment assessing the effects of DC and macrophage populations on Tg4 Teff cells in vitro. In order to mimic in vivo timings used in the paper, we stimulated for 4 days with or without MBP peptide. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>, all DC populations (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sub>-</sub>, CD8<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup> and pDC) as well as macrophages were equally capable of activation Tg4 Teff as assessed by CD44 upregulation. All APC populations also led to strongly increased PD-1 expression. Most tellingly, CD4<sup>+</sup> DC did not drive a loss in the ability of Tg4 Teff to produce proinflammatiory cytokines (IFN-γ and GM-SCF). Therefore these in vitro experiments using isolated DC were unable to recapitulate the tolerant nature of Tg4 Teff exposed to PIT in vivo. We conclude that, as we anticipated in our previous letter, activation of DC during their ex vivo isolation precludes any meaningful development of an in vitro model to determine/mimic their in vivo tolerogenic function. Based on this, and the comparatively rare nature of the CD4<sup>+</sup> DC population, any follow-on attempts at using these cells in transfer models seem impractical. We have not included these data in the revised manuscript.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>In vitro DC: T cell cultures.

For example, does PIT induce MBP-tetramer+ PD-1-high anergic T cells in normal mice</italic>?</p><p>This is challenging because MBP tetramers are not available to us. However, there is an alternative approach.</p><p>Suggested experiments:</p><p>We propose to use the MOG-induced EAE model in C57BL/6 mice. Passive EAE can be transferred using T effector cells taken from lymph node cells from MOG-immunized donor mice (O'Connor et al., 2008). These can be transferred prior to PIT/vehicle administration and the donor cells assessed for PD-1 expression, as we have done for Tg4 cells in the original manuscript.</p><p>We shall use a congenic marker to distinguish the transferred cells (CD90.2 cells into CD90.1 hosts). Please note that we would not have the absolute purity that the Tg4 transfer system allows (i.e. not all of the transferred T cells will be MOG-responsive), so we do not propose to undertake downstream epigenetic studies, which would also be time-consuming. However, this plan should be sufficient to identify any PD-1hi population that emerges in donor cells following exposure to PIT versus PBS, as the reviewer suggests.</p><p>UPDATE: For these experiments we chose to slightly modify the proposed approach, by focusing on ovalbumin (323-339)-driven T cell responses. The reason for this was that we had access to an (untested) I-Ab/OVA(323-339) tetramer. Unfortunately, tetramer-staining was not reliable due apparent non-specific staining of host T cells. Despite this, we were able to gain clear evidence that PIT using OVA(323-339) had induced upregulation of PD-1 amongst transferred Teff cells (pOVA-primed CD45.1+ Teff cells into CD45.2 hosts). Moreover, intracellular staining showed that PIT clearly inhibited the ability of donor Teff cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data have been included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7 fig5s8">Figure 5–figure supplements 7 and 8</xref>, and are described in an extended Results section.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) Studies in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>show that administration of MBP peptide i.v. leads to persistence of Ag-specific donor T cells.

This also means that there is no dramatic loss of PIT-exposed T cells following secondary exposure to TCR stimulation at immunization; numbers of Tg4 cells in the PIT-treated mice are similar before immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> upper left) and after immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> upper right).</p><p>Intracellular staining (ICS) revealed that the frequencies and numbers of IL-17+ donor Tg4 cells were significantly reduced following PIT and there was a similar trend for IFN-γ+ cells.

However, when comparing donor cells in the spleens of PBS-treated versus PIT-treated hosts, the elevation seen in PIT-treated WT cells (shown in the manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) was accentuated when donor cells were PD-1 deficient.</p><p>We saw no PIT-driven elevation in the frequencies of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells amongst the donor cells, although PIT-exposed PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> donor cells showed elevated numbers of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells as a reflection of their elevated total numbers.

However, we would like to emphasize that this is rather tangential to the purpose of this study, which was to use Teff cells to better model the clinical scenario and to provide insights into the mechanistic basis for PIT in that setting. Tg4 cells serve as a well-established resource for analysis of PIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhart et al., 1999</xref>; Sundstedt et al., 2003; Anderson et al., 2006; Nicolson et al., 2006; Gabrysova et al., 2009), although the Tg4 cell transfer models that we describe here have not been utilized previously.</p><p>Hence, although we show the data on naïve Tg4 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1 and 3</xref>, these really serve as a prelude to the data using Teff cells. Using other models, a body of evidence is now indicating that Teff cells behave quite differently to naïve T cells in response to PIT. In particular, Teff appear capable of survival/expansion, rather than undergoing apoptosis (David et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackenzie et al., 2014</xref>). This is consistent with the expansion of Tg4 Teff that we report here.</p><p>The reviewer is correct to highlight that PD-1 was dispensable in our previous study of PIT in naïve T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Konkel et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, we discussed this difference in the manuscript, in the Discussion section. That model saw deletion of naïve T cells in response to PIT. Therefore, despite upregulation of PD-1 by PIT exposed T cells, there was no opportunity for this to mediate tolerance, as the cells died. This explains why PD-1 was not required in that model for the maintenance of tolerance (the cells had been deleted).</p><p>Of particular note, that previous study, used ovalbumin-responsive TCR transgenic T cells, OT-II.</p><p>We have recently used OT-II T cells that had been polarized towards Th2 Teff to study PIT in the setting of allergic airways inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackenzie et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with the current study, there we also saw that Teff cells survived and expanded in number in response to PIT, emphasising the differences between naïve and Teff cells, using cells from the same TCR transgenic source.</p><p>Therefore, the survival of Tg4 Teff that we observe here is consistent with the developing paradigm (Campbell et al., 2009; David et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackenzie et al., 2014</xref>). We have previously discussed in detail the molecular basis for the apoptosis of naïve T cells in response to PIT and can insert a suitable review reference (Hochweller et al., 2006).</p><p>The reasons why naïve Tg4 cells are not deleted by PIT merit detailed interrogation. However, such analyses represent a long-term project, beyond the scope of the current manuscript, which has focused on mechanistic studies using Teff cells.</p><p><italic>Further new data</italic>:</p><p>The editors requested that we addressed how PIT induces PD-1 dependent anergy. We have performed additional experiments comparing the response profiles of Tg4.PD<sup>−1+/+</sup> versus Tg4.PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> Teff to PIT. As can be seen in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>, there is a marked expansion in the numbers of Tg4.PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> Teff cells in response to PIT. This is indicative of unrestrained clonal expansion in the absence of PD-1 signalling. To explore this further, we have assessed the ability of the Tg4 Teff to express CD25, and to produce and respond to IL-2. Upon ex vivo retrieval (4 days after PIT or PBS) levels of CD25 expression were low, irrespective of treatment group. CD25 expression was upregulated by in vitro stimulation with MBP peptide. Notably, this CD25 upregulation was impaired in the PIT-treated Tg4.PD<sup>−1+/+</sup> Teff cells, but was intact in PIT-treated Tg4.PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> Teff cells. As a consequence phosphorylation of STAT5 upon exposure to IL-2 in PIT-treated Tg4.PD-1<sup>−/−</sup> Teff cells was strong (at least equivalent to PBS-treated Teff cells), but was impaired in PIT-treated Tg4.PD<sup>−1+/+</sup> Teff cells. These data suggest that a key function of PD-1 during PIT is to restrict the capacity of Teff to proliferate through, impaired CD25 upregulation and STAT5 signaling.</p><p>We have added these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2 fig5s3 fig5s4 fig5s5 fig5s6">Figure 5–figure supplements 1-6</xref></p><p>We have added an additional section to the Results, describing these data and extended the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
