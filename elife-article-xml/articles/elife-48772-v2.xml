Late-onset diseases (LOD) occur between 7 and 89 days of life and are largely due to the CC17 GBS hypervirulent clone. We studied the impact of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), which impregnate the fetus during pregnancy, on GBS neonatal infection in cellular and mouse models of hormonal exposure corresponding to concentrations found at birth (E2-P4 C<sub>0</sub>) and over 7 days old (E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub>).

CC17 GBS crosses the intestinal barrier through M cells. This process mediated by the CC17-specific surface protein Srr2 is enhanced by E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> concentrations which promote M cell differentiation and CC17 GBS invasiveness.

This Gram positive encapsulated bacterium can also turn into a deadly pathogen in neonates and is recognized as a leading cause of neonatal invasive infections (bacteremia, meningitis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards et al., 2011</xref>). Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the global burden of GBS neonatal infections remains substantial, with up to 10% mortality and 30% neurologic sequelae in surviving infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Libster et al., 2012</xref>). Two GBS-associated syndromes are distinguished in neonates, the early-onset disease (EOD) which occurs within 48 hr after birth in 90% of the cases, and the late-onset disease (LOD) which occurs between 7 and 89 days of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards et al., 2011</xref>). EOD primarily manifests as a pneumonia and a bacteremia subsequent to the inhalation by the neonate of GBS contaminated amniotic fluid or vaginal secretions during delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the mode of transmission and the infection route of LOD, characterized by a bacteremia without focus and a high rate of associated meningitis, remain elusive, and although the gastrointestinal tract represents the most likely portal of entry, the circumstances leading to LOD remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tazi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Worldwide epidemiological data have identified that GBS strains are distributed among five major clonal complexes (CC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Da Cunha et al., 2014</xref>). One particular GBS clone, almost exclusively of capsular serotype III and designated the hypervirulent CC17 clone, is strongly associated with LOD (60% to 80% of the cases) and with meningitis (approx. 80% of the cases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bekker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joubrel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seale et al., 2016</xref>). CC17 GBS expresses specific surface proteins which promote intestinal colonization and confer blood brain barrier (BBB) translocation abilities in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Six et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tazi et al., 2010</xref>). Remarkably, this clone is less responsible for EOD and largely underrepresented in GBS adult diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martins et al., 2012</xref>) implying that specific host factors might be involved in CC17 GBS invasiveness in &gt;7 day-old neonates.</p><p>One particular aspect of the perinatal life is the very high concentration of pregnancy-related hormones, especially estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), to which neonates are exposed all along pregnancy. This hormonal exposure leads to neonatal circulating concentrations at birth which are more than 500 times superior to those of a male adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lagiou et al., 2014</xref>). These levels drop during the first 3 days of life to stabilize for several months at concentrations still 5 to 50 times higher than those of an adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khashana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuijper et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, sex hormones modulate the immune response and the permeability of cellular barriers in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kovats, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson and Klein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Straub, 2007</xref>). Thus, E2 and P4 concentrations found at a given time-period of the neonate’s development could promote GBS and more particularly CC17 GBS invasiveness and LOD.</p><p>Using an approach combining murine and cellular models of infection with one CC17 and one non-CC17 representative GBS isolates, both of capsular serotype III and responsible for neonatal disease, we demonstrate that hormonal exposure to E2 and P4 concentrations found in 7-day-old neonates (E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub>) specifically favors CC17 GBS pathogeny in comparison to E2 and P4 levels found at birth (E2-P4 C<sub>0</sub>). The increased invasiveness of CC17 GBS in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> condition is linked to an enhanced crossing of the intestinal barrier through M cells which is mediated by the CC17-specific surface protein Srr2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>E2-P4 circulating levels modulate the severity of CC17 GBS meningitis in mice</title><p>We used a murine model of meningitis following oral gavage and intestinal translocation to determine whether hormonal concentrations could impact GBS and more particularly CC17 GBS infection. Prior to infection, specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice were submitted to a hormonal impregnation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hata et al., 2014</xref>) leading to circulating E2 and P4 levels measured 4 hr after the last hormonal administration equivalent to those found at birth (C<sub>0</sub> mice) or 7 days later (C<sub>7</sub> mice), that is approx. 1.10<sup>−8</sup> and 1.10<sup>−6</sup> M at birth, and 5.10<sup>−10</sup> and 5.10<sup>−8</sup> M at day 7, for E2 and P4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Control mice were administered the vehicle alone and showed E2 and P4 levels approx. 100 times and 1000 times lower than those of C<sub>7</sub> and C<sub>0</sub> mice, respectively. Four hours after the last hormonal injection, mice were gavaged either by a CC17 GBS (strain BM110, capsular serotype III) or by a non-CC17 GBS (strain NEM316, capsular serotype III) belonging to the clonal complex 23 (CC23 GBS). Indeed, CC23 GBS are representative of capsular serotype III non-CC17 GBS isolates responsible for neonatal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Da Cunha et al., 2014</xref>). Mice subsequent gavage by 2.10<sup>10 </sup>colony forming units (CFU) of CC17 GBS led to higher bacterial counts (~10 fold) in the brain of C<sub>7</sub> mice, 2 and 24 hr after infection, compared to C<sub>0</sub> and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), demonstrating that E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> concentrations contribute to the severity of CC17 GBS infection. In contrast, the same experiment using CC23 GBS did not show any significant difference between the 3 groups of mice, and lower CFU counts in the brain of CC23 compared to CC17-infected C<sub>7</sub> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) indicating that E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> concentrations specifically favor CC17 GBS infection in our experimental model. CC17 GBS and CC23 GBS growth <italic>in vitro</italic> was not altered by E2-P4 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that these results were not due a direct impact of E2 and P4 on bacterial multiplication in mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48772.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>E2-P4 hormone levels modulate CC17 GBS dissemination and the severity of meningitis following oral infection in mice.</title><p>SPF 3-week-old mice were administered E2-P4 cocktails subcutaneously for four consecutive days leading to E2-P4 circulating levels equivalent to those found in neonates at birth (E2-P4 C<sub>0</sub> mice) or 7 days later (E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> mice).

To identify the steps at which E2-P4 concentrations contribute to CC17 GBS virulence, bacteria were enumerated in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), spleen, and blood, 2 hr and 24 hr following mice oral inoculation. CC17 GBS crossed the intestinal barrier and reached the MLN, the spleen, and the blood within 2 hr after mice gavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). However, no bacteria could be detected 24 hr after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating early digestive translocation and dissemination, followed by efficient bacterial clearance. Besides, CC17 bacterial counts in the MLN and in the blood 2 hr after infection were increased ~10 fold in C<sub>7</sub> mice in comparison to C<sub>0</sub> and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), showing that E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> hormonal condition promoted CC17 GBS dissemination. The enhanced invasiveness of CC17 GBS in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> mice was associated with a stronger inflammatory response compared to C<sub>0</sub> and control mice as indicated by the increased circulating levels of several cytokines including the interleukins IL-1ß and IL-10, and the leukocytes chemoattractant proteins CCL20 and CXCL2 which are secreted by epithelial and immune cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ranasinghe and Eri, 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>In parallel, we also investigated the possibility of a better survival of CC17 GBS to the host’s immune defenses and of an enhanced translocation of the BBB in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> mice. To this end, we used a murine model in which mice were submitted to the hormonal exposure described above and infected intravenously with 2.10<sup>7</sup> CFU of the CC17 GBS isolate. The resulting bacteremia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) and total CFU counts in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) were not statistically different between C<sub>0</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>, and control mice, 2 hr, 24 hr and 48 hr after infection, showing that neither bacterial clearance nor bacterial crossing of the BBB were affected by the hormonal conditions tested.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CC17 GBS crosses the intestinal barrier through Peyer’s patches in a process favored by E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> concentrations</title><p>Our results indicated that the severity of infection in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> mice was mainly due to an enhanced crossing of the intestinal barrier which occurred quickly after infection, as exemplified by the CFU counts in the MLN 2 hr following mouse oral gavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Therefore, we sought to identify the portal of entry of CC17 GBS.

This process is achieved by microfold cells, also referred to as M cells, which represent approx. 10% of the cells within the FAE. M cells provide an efficient delivery of microorganisms and antigens to the underlying mucosal tissue, which contains an assorted population of lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mabbott et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>). DC can also directly uptake the bacteria from the intestinal lumen by extending their dendrites through the tight junctions between enterocytes or through cellular pores in the M cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mabbott et al., 2013</xref>). Bacterial association with M cells and DC being transient, we chose to perform intestinal ligated loops infections in order to maintain a high GBS density in the intestinal lumen and to increase the probability of observing GBS interactions with host cells. Using confocal microscopy imaging of mouse intestinal ligated loops infected by CC17 GBS, we observed both M cells-associated bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and bacteria associated with CD11c positive cells, CD11c being a marker for macrophages and DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–e</xref>).

However, despite neonates’ massive intrauterine exposure to E2 and P4 and their obvious contribution to immune system regulation and to the outcome of many infectious diseases during pregnancy, their impact on neonates’ susceptibility to infection remains poorly studied and is often restricted to investigating alterations due to hormone levels found in cord blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giannoni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kraft et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, E2 and P4 circulating concentrations remain elevated up to 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khashana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuijper et al., 2013</xref>), and using models representative of concentrations encountered in a newborn and in a neonate aged over 7 days old, we could i) unravel the role of M cells which are found in the Peyer’s patches as major portals of entry of CC17 GBS invasive infections and ii) demonstrate that hormonal levels regulate M cells maturation and therefore CC17 GBS invasiveness. Indeed, M cells are necessary for CC17 GBS crossing of intestinal epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that the preferential invasion route for CC17 GBS in this cellular model is transcytosis through M cells. Transcytosis is potentiated by E2-P4 hormonal conditions encountered in over 7 day-old neonates in correlation with a better M cell maturation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and a higher CC17 GBS association with M cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Accordingly, CC17 GBS crossing of the intestinal barrier <italic>in vivo</italic> including CC17 GBS invasion of the Peyer’s patches is increased by E2-P4 hormonal conditions encountered in over 7 day-old neonates. Thus, we identified a cellular pathway for CC17 GBS intestinal translocation and showed that CC17 GBS exploits M cells to invade the host and reach the lymphatic system to disseminate. Importantly, we also demonstrate that GBS – M cells interaction is specific to the hypervirulent CC17 clone and mediated by the surface protein Srr2 revealing a new contribution of this virulence factor to CC17 GBS pathogenesis. Because the surface protein Srr2 is always and almost exclusively present in GBS isolates belonging to the highly homogenous hypervirulent CC17 clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brochet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Da Cunha et al., 2014</xref>), and because CC17 GBS invasiveness depends on its ability to cross the intestinal barrier through M cells, our observations that E2 and P4 concentrations encountered in over 7 day-old neonates favor CC17 GBS infection must apply to all CC17 GBS strains. Besides, although being impaired but not totally abolished, the capacity of the <italic>∆srr2</italic> mutant to cross the intestinal barrier and to reach the central nervous system is not enhanced in E2-P4 hormonal conditions encountered in over 7 day-old neonates, suggesting that the increased virulence of the WT CC17 in this condition is Srr2 dependent.</p><p>We previously showed that CC17 GBS was able to cause invasive disease and meningitis following oral infection, thereby demonstrating its ability to cross the intestinal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tazi et al., 2010</xref>). This infection route was furthermore associated with a dose-dependent mortality. Notably, mouse oral gavage with 1.10<sup>10</sup> CFU was associated with 60% mortality in the 12 hr following infection. Conversely, in this work, mice gavage with 2.10<sup>10</sup> CFU did not lead to any mortality for up to 24 hr in any of the 3 groups of mice, indicating that the difference between these two models was not attributable to the hormonal treatments but more likely to the age of the mice at the time of infection. Indeed, in our previous work, CC17 GBS ability to cross the intestine was assessed in 2 to 3 week-old pre-weaning mice whereas in this work, experiments were performed with 3 week-old mice which were stimulated with a hormonal treatment for almost one week and which were eventually 4 weeks old at the time of infection, emphasizing the age-related susceptibility to infection. Another interesting feature of the animal models used in this work resides in CC17 GBS capacity to reach the brain more efficiently in the first hours following oral than intravenous infection despite similar levels of bacteremia in both models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This difference gives insights into the dissemination pathways taken by GBS following each of these infection modes. After intravenous injection in the tail vein, bacteria reach the inferior vena cava (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cook, 1965</xref>) and the vast majority of them is then captured by the spleen and the liver. Conversely, when bacteria disseminate through the lymphatic vessels after they got to the MLN following oral infection, they eventually reach the blood circulation <italic>via</italic> the thoracic duct directly in the subclavian vein, thereby shunting the hepatic portal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hsu and Itkin, 2016</xref>). These major differences are objectivized by the bacterial loads in the spleen following these 2 modes of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and reinforce the hypothesis that CC17 GBS preferentially disseminates <italic>via</italic> the lymphatic system following oral infection.</p><p>The overwhelming responsibility of CC17 GBS in neonatal invasive disease especially in LOD and meningitis has been attributed to the specific expression of the surface proteins HvgA and Srr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Six et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tazi et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, comparative genomics revealed that CC17 strains, which constitute a highly homogenous clonal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Da Cunha et al., 2014</xref>), exhibit a few specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brochet et al., 2006</xref>).

Besides, HvgA confers gut colonization capacities in murine models and it was presumed that CC17 GBS association with LOD was related to an increased ability of CC17 GBS to colonize neonates compared to other GBS clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tazi et al., 2010</xref>). However, a recent large prospective cohort study of infant colonization by GBS showed that instead of colonizing neonates more efficiently than other GBS clones, CC17 GBS was associated with a higher risk of delayed post-delivery colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tazi et al., 2019</xref>). Together with our findings, these results suggest that the important responsibility of CC17 GBS in LOD relies i) on its improved capacity to establish in the infant developing and versatile microbiota, advantage which is likely conferred by HvgA, and ii) on Srr2-mediated ability to use M cells to cross the intestinal barrier and eventually to disseminate.</p><p>Enteroinvasive pathogens have developed numerous strategies to subvert M cells and gain access to deeper tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Da Silva et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>). These strategies include direct binding of bacterial effectors with M cell-specific carbohydrates and receptors, such as the FimH pilus protein of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium interaction with the GP2 M cell surface protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mabbott et al., 2013</xref>), but also the direct regulation of M cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tahoun et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, CC17 GBS interaction with M cells might involve an M cell-specific receptor targeted by Srr2. Besides, E2 and P4 contribute to CC17 transcytosis by regulating M cell maturation, likely through alterations of the NF-ΚB pathway which is known to be regulated by steroid hormones and directly involved in M cells differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson and Klein, 2012</xref>). Whether the differentiation process strictly depends on E2 or P4 or on a combination of both hormones still has to be investigated. At last, steroid hormones impact the immune responses and might thereby influence microbiota composition which in turn shapes the immune system development and the maturation of the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sommer and Bäckhed, 2013</xref>). Therefore, gut microbiota and GBS colonization likely contribute to M cells maturation and further studies are needed to address the possible relationship between microbiota composition, intestinal colonization by the different GBS clones, and the onset of LOD.</p><p>Finally, the rapidity of CC17 GBS entire infectious process which takes place within 2 hr from mice oral infection to central nervous system invasion together with the low-associated bacteremia gives rise to the hypothesis of a dissemination through a Trojan horse mechanism which is exacerbated in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> condition. This hypothesis is supported by the association of CC17 GBS with CD11c - a marker for macrophages and DC - positive cells in the Peyer’s patches and by the increased proportion of CD11c positive cells in the MLN of CC17-infected mice, especially in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> condition. Indeed, enteric pathogens can invade the host using various cellular routes including transcytosis across M cells, transcytosis across enterocytes or direct uptake from the intestinal lumen by Peyer's patches DC which can extend their dendrites through M cells or between enterocytes tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lelouard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mabbott et al., 2013</xref>). Once in the <italic>lamina propria</italic>, bacteria can be taken up by mononuclear phagocytes, including macrophages and other DC subsets. Unlike macrophages that rapidly kill microorganisms in their phagosomes, classical DC can retain unprocessed antigens, including bacteria, for several days before transferring these antigens to naive B cells to initiate a specific antibody response. Hence, viable commensal bacteria can be recovered from classical DC migrating within afferent mesenteric lymph and this process aiming at initiating the mucosal immune response can be exploited by some pathogens to disseminate. For instance, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infects intestinal DC and subverts their migration capacities to gain access to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Courret et al., 2006</xref>). Whether CC17 GBS can be taken up by intestinal DC, survive in these cells hidden from the host immune system, and subvert their migration capacities to reach the central nervous system still has to be investigated.</p><p>In conclusion, our results provide new insights for the understanding of CC17 GBS pathophysiology and for its intimate association with neonatal LOD, which can now not only be linked to HvgA-mediated intestinal colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tazi et al., 2010</xref>), but also to an efficient Srr2-mediated interaction with M cells conditioned by neonatal hormonal concentrations and gastrointestinal tract development. Given the critical role played by Srr2 in the initiation of the infectious process and the burden of CC17 GBS LOD, Srr2 stands together with HvgA as a highly relevant target for vaccine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2018</xref>;

<italic>Streptococcus</italic> Late Onset infection after the first week of life. The results contained in the manuscript show that under conditions representing hormone levels after 7 days post birth, infection with the GBS leads to meningitis as the bacteria are better able to cross the intestinal barrier compared to conditions representing hormone levels at birth. The success of strains of GBS CC17 clonal complex is explained by their expression of the surface protein <italic>srr2</italic> that allows invasion of the intestinal barrier. The results presented here are of general interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers as they reveal that a commensal opportunistic pathogen can take advantage of the effect of hormonal levels on intestinal cell differentiation to invade the host. This work paves the way for research on other pathogens responsible for Late Onset infections.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Perinatal hormones favor CC17 Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> intestinal translocation through M cells and hypervirulence&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All the reviewers agree that this is quite an interesting study showing the effect of pregnancy hormones (estradiol and progesterone) on the late onset of neonatal GBS sepsis. Using a mouse model of hormonal exposure and oral bacterial challenge, you showed that conditions representing hormone levels after 7 days post birth favor meningitis following infection with GBS CC17 rather than conditions representing hormone levels at birth, because of a better translocation across the intestinal barrier through the Peyer's patches. Your work also reveals an interesting effect of the Srr2 protein in modulating the interaction of GBS CC17 BM110 with intestinal cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. The work is important and would be of interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers, pending revision of a few key points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- Without controls, the presumed role of high neonatal hormone concentrations remains unclear. No control for the hormone treatment (just vehicle) is provided. Without a 'no hormone' control it is difficult to determine if C<sub>7</sub> levels of E2 and P4 promote infection or if higher levels of E2 and P4 at C<sub>0</sub> supress infection. Please add this control, a dose-response experiment and provide growth curves of GBS in presence of hormones.</p><p>- Is the effect of Srr2 specific for the enhanced virulence of CC17 and is it common to other CC17 isolates? Is the effect of Srr specific for the enhanced virulence of CC17 at E2-P4C<sub>7</sub>, since tissue and organ invasion are also reduced in E2-P4 C<sub>0</sub>?</p><p>- Since Srr2 is responsible for adhesion to M cells in the <italic>in vitro</italic> model and for GBS invasion in the mouse model, could the authors demonstrate that Srr2 is actually responsible for the translocation across the M cells?

Please add this control.</p></disp-quote><p>The “no hormone” control has been added in the experiments showing the impact of hormonal levels on bacterial dissemination and intestinal translocation in mice (Figure 1 and 2) as well as in the experiments analyzing the impact of hormones on bacterial translocation through M cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure 3 and 4).</p><p>This control was actually already performed before submitting the first version of the manuscript in almost all experiments (those shown in Figure 1 and 3 but not those in Figure 2 and 4). Given the fact that it showed no significant difference with the E2-P4 C<sub>0</sub> condition, we thought not to show it. As requested, this control is now provided in the revised version. It clearly shows no significant difference with the highest levels of E2 and P4 at C<sub>0</sub>, indicating that this latter condition does not obviously suppress the infection, which is now specified in the main text of the manuscript wherever necessary (“and control”).</p><p>Data shown on Figure 2 are the results of new experiments. We confirm that E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> hormonal concentrations increase the number of intratissular bacteria in the Peyer’s patches but we did not find, as previously written, that intratissular bacterial counts in the Peyer’s patches were increased compared to intratissular bacterial counts in the intestine. Therefore, the sentence “the number of intratissular bacteria was ~20 times higher in the Peyer’s patches than in the rest of the intestine” has been suppressed in the revised version of the manuscript (subsection “CC17 GBS crosses the intestinal barrier through Peyer’s patches in a process favored by E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> concentrations”, first paragraph). We think that this difference is due to mice susceptibility to infection which can greatly varies from a litter to another and which was increased in our latest experiments. Nevertheless, it does not change the main conclusion of the corresponding paragraph which remains that E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> hormonal condition is associated with “an increased crossing of the intestinal barrier by CC17 GBS through the Peyer’s patches”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please add a dose-response experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the request to provide a dose-response experiment, we disagreed for both scientific and ethical reasons listed below.</p><p>i) The “control” condition in mice corresponds to mice which were administered the vehicle (sesame oil) alone instead of vehicle + hormones. These mice do actually synthetize physiological basal levels of E2 and P4 which were quantified in their serum. Circulating levels of E2 and P4 in control mice are approx. 100 times and 1,000 times lower than those of E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> and E2-P4 C<sub>0</sub> mice, respectively. Thus, the 3 groups of mice already represent 3 different doses of hormones.</p><p>ii) Adding a fourth group of mice with levels of E2 and P4 10 times lower than E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> mice would have been difficult to interpret. Indeed, the effect of hormones and especially of E2 is biphasic and not strictly dose-dependent. For instance, high levels of E2 are anti-inflammatory whereas low levels are pro-inflammatory (Straub, 2007). Therefore, mice impregnated with E2-P4 levels 10 times lower than C<sub>7</sub> mice could be either more susceptible than C<sub>7</sub> mice, or conversely similar to control mice. Besides, given the important inter-individual variability of hormonal concentrations during infancy, these concentrations do not correspond to a precise period of child development and can be found between 2 and 5 months of age (Kuijper et al., 2013; Schaadt, Brain Lang, 2015).</p><p>iii) To statistically analyze the effect of this additional hormonal condition, we should have repeated all the animal experiments already performed with 3 groups of mice with the 4 groups of mice, which would have importantly extended the number of animals used in this study without providing real insights to the main question raised in the paper, i.e. whether and how hormonal levels found at LOD onset, corresponding to the E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> condition, could specifically favor CC17 GBS infection in comparison to hormonal levels found at birth.</p><p>In conclusion, for all these reasons, we decided not to add this experiment and we hope that you will agree with these considerations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please provide growth curves of GBS in presence of hormones.</p></disp-quote><p>Growth curves of GBS in the different conditions are provided and show no difference. This result has been added as a new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and is commented in the subsection “E2-P4 circulating levels modulate the severity of CC17 GBS meningitis in mice”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Is the effect of Srr2 specific for the enhanced virulence of CC17 and is it common to other CC17 isolates?</p></disp-quote><p>Srr2 belongs to a large family of serine-rich repeat glycoproteins widespread in streptococci and staphylococci. Molecular epidemiological data using either gene sequencing (Brochet et al., 2006) or whole genome sequencing (Da Cunha et al., 2014) of more than 200 GBS strains revealed that Srr2 is always and almost exclusively present in CC17 strains, whereas the non-CC17 isolates express another serine-rich repeat protein called Srr1. Despite structural similarities, Srr1 and Srr2 only display 32% of sequence identity at the amino-acid level (Six et al., 2015). Therefore, the impact of Srr2 on CC17 virulence is considered specific and common to other CC17 isolates. These epidemiological data regarding Srr2 distribution in GBS strains are more clearly explained in the Results subsection “The surface protein Srr2 contributes to CC17 GBS interaction with M cells and to the severity of meningitis in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> condition” and in the first paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the effect of Srr specific for the enhanced virulence of CC17 at E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub>, since tissue and organ invasion are also reduced in E2-P4 C<sub>0</sub>?</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that the virulence of the <italic>∆srr2</italic> mutant is not enhanced in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> mice suggests that the increased virulence of the WT CC17 in this condition is Srr2 dependent. We acknowledge that we cannot exclude the possibility that the intestinal translocation abilities of the <italic>∆srr2</italic> mutant could be so altered that we could not observe an increased translocation of the mutant in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> condition. However, this possibility seems very unlikely given the fact that the capacity of the <italic>∆srr2</italic> mutant to cross the intestine is not completely abolished, with median intratissular bacterial counts in the Peyer’s patches of approx. 500 CFU/g of tissue. This point is discussed in the first paragraph of the Discussion section, and we tempered our initial conclusion that Srr2 contributes to the enhanced virulence in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> condition accordingly, replacing “demonstrating that Srr2 participates to the increased virulence of CC17 GBS in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> hormonal condition” by “suggesting that Srr2.</p><p> <italic>- Since Srr2 is responsible for adhesion to M cells in the</italic> in vitro <italic>model and for GBS invasion in the mouse model, could the authors demonstrate that Srr2 is actually responsible for the translocation across the M cells? The authors should use their</italic> in vitro <italic>model used to demonstrate translocation in Figure 3 to demonstrate this using the Srr2 wild type and isogenic mutant.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for requesting this experiment which was indeed missing. The capacity of the <italic>∆srr2</italic> mutant to cross the monolayer composed of enterocytes and M cells has been assessed and the results showing that Srr2 actually contributes to CC17 transcytosis have been added to Figure 5 (shown as Figure 5C) and commented in the first paragraph of the subsection “The surface protein Srr2 contributes to CC17 GBS interaction with M cells and to the severity of meningitis in E2-P4 C<sub>7</sub> condition”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Perhaps non parametric tests might be more appropriate than t tests?</p></disp-quote><p>All the statistical tests that were performed were actually already non-parametric tests but we omitted to make it clear. We apologize for this misunderstanding and the mistake is now repaired, as specified in the Materials and methods subsection “Statistical analysis” and in the legends of the figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
