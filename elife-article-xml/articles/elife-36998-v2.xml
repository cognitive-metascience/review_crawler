We observed major differences in transcriptional signatures of precursor cells from mouse forebrain at embryonic days E8.5 vs. E10.5 (before vs. after neural tube closure). Genes encoding protein biosynthetic machinery were strongly downregulated at E10.5. This was matched by decreases in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, together with age-related changes in proteomic content of the adjacent fluids. Notably, c-MYC expression and mTOR pathway signaling were also decreased at E10.5, providing potential drivers for the effects on ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. Interference with c-MYC at E8.5 prematurely decreased ribosome biogenesis, while persistent c-MYC expression in cortical progenitors increased transcription of protein biosynthetic machinery and enhanced ribosome biogenesis, as well as enhanced progenitor proliferation leading to subsequent macrocephaly. These findings indicate large, coordinated changes in molecular machinery of forebrain precursors during early brain development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>forebrain</kwd><kwd>ribosome biogenesis</kwd><kwd>cerebrospinal fluid</kwd><kwd>amniotic fluid</kwd><kwd>MYC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chau</surname><given-names>Kevin F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS088566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehtinen</surname><given-names>Maria K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehtinen</surname><given-names>Maria K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFARI Pilot Grant #402089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehtinen</surname><given-names>Maria K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003194</institution-id><institution>New York Stem Cell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Robertson Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehtinen</surname><given-names>Maria K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH T32 HL110852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chau</surname><given-names>Kevin F</given-names></name><name><surname>Fame</surname><given-names>Ryann M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unbiased transcriptome analyses reveal that neural progenitor cells downregulate protein biosynthetic machinery during early forebrain development, and this fundamental process matches proteomic changes in the adjacent cerebrospinal fluid and is regulated in part by MYC.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural tube closure (neurulation) is a fundamental milestone of early brain development, yet relatively little is known about the cellular and molecular transitions occurring in neural precursor cells before and after this process due to experimental challenges inherent to investigating this nascent organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greene and Copp, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Massarwa and Niswander, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wallingford et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilde et al., 2014</xref>). Prior to neural tube closure, the neural plate is home to multipotent neural stem cells, including forebrain neurectodermal precursor cells. After neural tube closure, these neurectodermal precursors become progressively lineage restricted as neuroepithelial cells, and then radial glial cells, ultimately giving rise to all neurons and glia in the adult forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bjornsson et al., 2015</xref>). As these progenitors proliferate, their spatial patterning serves as a blueprint for the maturing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rallu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sur and Rubenstein, 2005</xref>). While genes involved in driving the more mature stages of forebrain development are becoming better understood, remarkably little is known about the key genes orchestrating the function of earlier neurectodermal precursors.</p><p>While transcriptional regulation is essential for the specification and maturation of the early forebrain, less is known about the dynamics of protein biosynthesis at this early stage. Recent studies have begun to explore how regulated protein synthesis is critical for the successful construction and function of healthy cells and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujii et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kondrashov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pilaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roko Rasin and Silver, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shi and Barna, 2015</xref>). In turn, the regulation of protein biosynthetic machinery has emerged as a tunable program that can instruct cellular transitions between stem cell dormancy, proliferation, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeBoer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujii et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khajuria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kraushar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scognamiglio et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins are associated with neural tube closure defects (NTD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greene and Copp, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilde et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that regulation of protein biosynthesis is critical during the earliest stages of forebrain development as well. Proteomic analyses have also revealed that ribosomal and translational proteins are elevated in amniotic fluid (AF) prior to neurulation, and are substantially decreased in nascent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chau et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanisms leading to these changes in the AF and CSF proteomes remain incompletely understood, as this developmental stage precedes choroid plexus development and its secretion of factors into the CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hunter and Dymecki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lehtinen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lun et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used RNA sequencing to reveal the transcriptomic signature of presumptive forebrain precursor cells before and after neurulation. High expression of the protein biosynthetic machinery together with elevated protein synthesis emerged as a signature of early neural precursors. These transcriptional and cell biological changes closely mirrored proteomic changes in the adjacent AF and CSF. Many genes that were downregulated after neurulation are known, direct targets of the transcription factor c-MYC (hereafter MYC) in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Porath et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zeller et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly, MYC modulated ribosome biogenesis in forebrain precursors. Its forced, persistent expression in neural progenitors by mouse genetics approaches increased transcription of protein biosynthetic machinery and was accompanied by increased proliferation of radial glial progenitors leading to macrocephaly by birth. Taken together, our data identify regulation of protein biosynthetic machinery as an important signature of early forebrain development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptome signature of early forebrain neuroepithelium</title><p>To define the identity and biology of developing forebrain neuroepithelial cells, we microdissected the neuroepithelium away from the adjacent mesenchyme and surface ectoderm in E8.5 and E10.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chau et al., 2015</xref>), and performed next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Consistent with the progressive lineage restriction of progenitors, initiation of neurogenesis, and patterning of the brain, the most enriched gene category at E10.5 was related to neuronal differentiation (e.g. <italic>Ngn1, Blbp, Glast, Tbr2, Bmp4</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, unexpectedly, the three most enriched gene categories in E8.5 neuroepithelium were related to protein biosynthetic machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and included genes encoding ribosomal proteins (e.g. <italic>Rpl24</italic>), genes involved in ribosome biogenesis (e.g. <italic>Fbl, Dkc1</italic>), and translation factors (e.g. <italic>Eif4e</italic>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) further confirmed that genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis were significantly enriched in E8.5 progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). MA plots (expression ratio [<underline>M</underline>] <italic>vs.</italic> average intensity [<underline>A</underline>], log transformed) provided an overview of the expression changes of individual genes, revealing that the majority of genes encoding ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and translation factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), were enriched in E8.5 neuroepithelium. Expression of ribosomal protein or translation factor genes at E10.5 vs. E8.5 showed a positive correlation (R = 0.91 and 0.98 respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>), indicating that despite downregulation of most ribosomal and translation factor genes, their stoichiometry remained similar at the two ages. Expression levels of differentially expressed genes at E10.5 vs. E8.5 also showed a positive correlation (R = 0.82, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). There was no correlation between the average expression levels of genes and their fold changes between the two ages (R = −0.1696).

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription and initial assembly of pre-ribosomes occurs in nucleoli. As increased ribosome biogenesis is associated with larger nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Silvera et al., 2010</xref>), nucleolar volume provides a proxy for ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>).

This work (1) demonstrates that enhanced biogenesis of ribosomes and protein synthetic machinery serve as transcriptional and cell biological signatures defining early forebrain precursor cells; (2) reveals that the changing proteomes of AF and CSF provide a biomarker signature that matches the concurrent, normal development of the adjacent forebrain; (3) identifies MYC as a contributor to the regulation of ribosome biogenesis in the developing forebrain; and (4) shows that persistent MYC expression leads to increased ribosome biogenesis, enhanced cortical progenitor proliferation, and macrocephaly. We conclude that, as in other stem cells, neural progenitor cells dynamically regulate protein biosynthetic machinery to meet their changing needs, and that this process is regulated in part by MYC.</p><p>The DNA transcriptome is an essential starting point for our understanding of tissue regionalization, patterning, and individual cell identities in the mammalian central nervous system. Nevertheless, not all mRNAs are selected for protein translation, and our discovery of temporal regulation of the protein biosynthetic machinery during early specification of the forebrain uncovers a new layer of regulation fundamental to the early construction of the brain. Regulation of the protein biosynthetic machinery provides a tunable molecular program harnessed by cells to guide transitions between stem cell states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeBoer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujii et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khajuria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kraushar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scognamiglio et al., 2016</xref>). Cell cycle in the forebrain lengthens over the course of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caviness and Takahashi, 1995</xref>). As such, the higher rates of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis observed in neurectodermal precursors relative to post-neurulation progenitors are consistent with a model in which rapidly dividing cells synthesize more proteins to support their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buszczak et al., 2014</xref>). Genes such as <italic>Pelo</italic> and <italic>Abce1</italic> are downregulated in E10.5 progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting that additional levels of translational control including ribosome recycling may be engaged during this developmental time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dever and Green, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Disruptions in ribosome structure and function are linked to a number of genetically inherited ribosomopathies such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boria et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choesmel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ebert and Lipton, 2011</xref>). Nucleolar size, ribosome biogenesis, and protein translation have been implicated in aging and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchwalter and Hetzer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tiku et al., 2016</xref>). In the central nervous system, disruptions in mRNA processing and translation can eventually impair the form and function of delicate neural circuitry. Changes in mRNA binding proteins are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kraushar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Popovitchenko et al., 2016</xref>), and stem cell-derived neural progenitors from schizophrenia patients have altered levels of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Topol et al., 2015</xref>). During later stages of neurogenesis in the cerebral cortex, subcellular transport of mRNA by binding proteins including FMRP (Fragile-X mental retardation protein) ferry mRNA to sites of local translation in more polarized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pilaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pilaz and Silver, 2017</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that in the developing forebrain, the assembly of specialized ribosomes could enable unique or localized translation in developing precursor cells, fine-tuning cellular identities and tailoring individualized developmental programs as in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bortoluzzi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujii et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simsek et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While ribosomal protein expression and ribosome biogenesis decrease as the embryo develops, we did not observed any difference in cytoplasmic ribosome density from EM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This might be due to the long half-life of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirsch and Hiatt, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nikolov et al., 1983</xref>), and thus ribosomes generated earlier at E8.5 would likely still be present at E10.5. Using OPP and methionine incorporation, we provided evidence that protein synthesis is also downregulated as the embryo develops. However, we do not know whether differential protein synthesis is driven by changes in ribosome biogenesis or by overall changes in transcription dynamics. Furthermore, OPP was administered intraperitoneally into the pregnant dams, and it is possible that availability of OPP to the embryonic progenitors might be different between E8.5 and E10.5. Indeed, increased ribosomal protein expression does not always result in increased translation because not all ribosomal proteins are associated with polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kraushar et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that some ribosomal proteins perform extraribosomal functions independent of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Warner and McIntosh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, RPL11 is recruited to the promoter regions of p53 target genes during nucleolar stress to promote p53 transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahata et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, additional evidence is needed to confirm that changes in ribosome biogenesis directly cause differential protein synthesis in the early neural progenitors.</p><p>Neural progenitors depend on their adjacent fluid environment for appropriate fluid pressure and instructive signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lun et al., 2015</xref>). Developing neural tissue also releases membrane bound vesicles into the adjacent fluid environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cossetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marzesco et al., 2005</xref>). We found that the protein biosynthetic changes occurring in the forebrain neuroepithelium were reflected in the proteomic content of the adjacent AF and CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The CSF is commonly sampled for biomarkers of neurologic diseases. Our data demonstrate that during early forebrain development, the proteomic signature of the early brain fluids provides a biomarker signature of the normal, healthy forebrain, opening a new ‘window’ into this stage of early brain development. Whether the ribosomal and translational machinery found in the AF and CSF are equipped to actively synthesize proteins within the fluid environment remains to be elucidated. Alternatively, the fluids might serve as a channel for intercellular transfer of ribosomes and other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cossetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Court et al., 2008</xref>). Future studies will also reveal whether maturation-associated release of protein biosynthetic machinery into the developing brain fluids is an active or passive process, and whether this process shares features with membrane shedding that occurs in other cell types, such as at the maturing red blood-cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gautier et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The swift downregulation of MYC following neurulation could be due to chromatin modifications, epigenetic mechanisms, and/or inhibition of RNA polymerase II elongation. <italic>Myc</italic>-deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kerosuo and Bronner, 2016</xref>) as well as ground-level changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and nucleosome positioning are associated with NTD (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greene and Copp, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilde et al., 2014</xref>). Cross-referencing our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) with NTD Wiki, a repository of genes required for neurulation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ntdwiki.wikispaces.com">www.ntdwiki.wikispaces.com</ext-link>), revealed that a number of MYC targets are associated with NTD (data not shown). Complex gene-environment interactions have long been appreciated to underlie NTD. Despite modern successes in reducing the incidence of NTD by dietary fortification (e.g. folate) and increased awareness of adverse consequences of maternal exposures (e.g. alcohol and drug use) on the developing fetus, NTD continue to represent one of the most common birth defects worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wallingford et al., 2013</xref>). Neurulation varies along the anterior-posterior axis, and specific cell types (e.g. hinge points, neural fold cells) have distinct roles in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Massarwa et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, while our study investigated anterior forebrain development, variation in expression of the protein biosynthetic machinery along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral/medial-lateral axes could differentially affect neurulation along the entire body axis. Overall, the identification of molecular pathways regulating protein biosynthetic machinery during neurulation may provide new opportunities to seek answers to these complex conditions.</p><p>Aberrant regulation of the signaling pathways examined in this study in cortical progenitors are associated with cortical overgrowth syndromes such as hemimegalencephaly, a brain malformation characterized by unilateral enlargement of one hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Gama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Poduri et al., 2012</xref>).

The tumorigenic consequences of persistent <italic>MYC</italic> expression of this model emerged later in adult mice as choroid plexus carcinoma and ciliary body medulloepithelioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shannon et al., 2018</xref>), exposing the select vulnerability of certain subtypes of epithelial cells in the <italic>Nestin</italic> lineage to tumorigenesis. Such selectivity of MYC-associated pathologies may be determined by the epigenetic landscape of differentiated cells in adult tissues. MYC may act as a universal amplifier of expressed genes, promoting proliferation in already dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nie et al., 2012</xref>). However, in more differentiated cells, target genes may be confined to heterochromatin and inaccessible to MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kress et al., 2015</xref>). Certain cell types may also require a genetic double-hit such as concomitant <italic>p53-</italic>deficiency in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Momota et al., 2008</xref>), or particular gene-environment triggers, for transformation.</p><p>Overall, cellular identity and health reflect the net equation between a cell’s transcriptional and translational output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buszczak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujii et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holmberg and Perlmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khajuria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>). These processes require multiple regulatory steps that are vulnerable to disruptions accumulating from cell-intrinsic genetic programs, and/or cell-extrinsic environmental cues. In the developing brain, environmental signals can entail disturbances of local gradients diffusing through tissues (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Toyoda et al., 2010</xref>) or altered delivery of growth-promoting factors by the adjacent AF or CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lehtinen et al., 2011</xref>). All of these signaling activities are susceptible to exogenous maternal exposures including illness, substance abuse, and environmental toxins. Thus, our findings provide a new paradigm for understanding brain development through investigation of molecular pathways regulating the biosynthetic machinery in forebrain progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus Musculus</italic>)</td><td>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm13(CAG-MYC,-CD2*)Rsky</sup>(referred as StopFLMYC)</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory <break/>(Bar Harbor, ME)</td><td>MGI:5444670</td><td>Maintained on a C57Bl/6 background</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus Musculus</italic>)</td><td>Tg(Nes-cre)1Kln (referred as <italic>Nestin-cre</italic>)</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>MGI:2176173</td><td>Maintained on a C57Bl/6 background</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus Musculus</italic>)</td><td>Foxg1<sup>tm1(cre)Skm</sup>(referred as <italic>Foxg1-cre</italic>)</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>MGI:1932522</td><td>Maintained on a C57Bl/6 background</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus Musculus</italic>)</td><td>Myc-deficient mice (<italic>c-myc<sup>-/-</sup></italic>)</td><td>Provided by Troy Baudino</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baudino et al.

For 20 images per individual (N = 3 at each age), ribosomal density was calculated within a 280.5 nm x 280.5 nm box in an inverted color image that contained only cytoplasm and ribosomes (no membrane bound organelles). Ribosomes were counted by the Imaris software using the ‘spots’ tool, with estimated diameter of 250px and with automatic background subtraction ‘on’, and quality above the automatic threshold. The number of ribosomes per field of view (FOV) was calculated by multiplying the above calculate density by the cytoplasmic area. The cytoplasmic area was calculated by creating a hand-drawn surface in Imaris around the free cytoplasmic space in the standard FOV (2692 nm x 1762.6 nm). The % FOV occupied by organelles was calculated by subtracting the free cytoplasmic area from the total area to arrive at the organelle-occupied area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Biological replicates (N) were defined as samples from distinct individuals analyzed either in the same experiment or within multiple experiments. Samples were pooled across multiple litters so as to reduce inter-litter variability. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism seven or R. Outliers were excluded using ROUT method (Q = 1%). Appropriate statistical tests were selected based on the distribution of data, homogeneity of variances, and sample size. F tests or Bartlett’s tests were used to assess homogeneity of variances between data sets. Parametric tests (T test, ANOVA) were used only if data were normally distributed and variances were approximately equal. Otherwise, nonparametric alternatives were chosen. Data are presented as means ± standard errors of the mean (SEMs). Please refer to figure legends for statistical tests used and sample size.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Dynamic changes in protein biosynthesis during cell fate restriction of neural progenitors and in tumorigenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers expressed enthusiasm for the conceptual advance and the timeliness of the studies. They acknowledge how these studies add to emerging work on the importance of translational regulation in the control of mammalian development and new concepts related to the control imposed on cell and tissue formation through specific ribosomal subunits. They also appreciate the variety of state of the art techniques and the initial transcriptional and proteomic experiments. However, in its current state, the paper is quite descriptive, somewhat correlative, the follow up analysis focusing on translation and the role of c-Myc in the process are lacking, and the manuscript is unfocused at the end.</p><p>The full reviews are attached below. A synopsis of the major critiques is outlined in the following 4 points.</p><p>1) The authors only directly examine whether protein synthesis is decreased post-neurulation (by the incorporation of OPP in Figure 2H) one time in the manuscript. The authors often use instead increased nucleolar volume (as a proxy) and EM analysis. The EM data need annotations and ideally immuno-gold to support the conclusion that punctae are actually ribosomes. It would be ideal if the authors could support their conclusion with standard molecular analysis of biogenesis – for example, are rRNA levels and/or processing different across development – and/or other direct measurements of protein synthesis and functional ribosomes (monosomes vs. polysomes).</p><p>2) Myc OE in apical progenitors is employed to support the idea that dynamic regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis is needed in neural progenitors over development. However, these data are largely correlative and it remains unclear mechanistically whether alterations in ribosomes and protein synthesis explain the Myc OE phenotypes. Although Myc has been previously linked to ribosome biogenesis, this transcription factor has other functions, for example in associating with and impacting cell cycle regulators. Thus, the described alterations in brain size, Pax6+ S phase cells, and Cux1 number could be due to cell cycle alterations, potentially independent of ribosome regulation. Consistent with this possibility, Myc OE embryonic brains exhibit only a slight increase in ribosome biogenesis and no significant alterations in translation. The JQ1 experiments are problematic in interpretation of a specific effect on Myc, as JQ1 is a broad epigenetic (bromodomain) inhibitor and alterations in a number of epigenetic regulators can lead to neural tube defects. Can the authors build a case that better supports the title of the paper with additional ways of manipulating translational machinery directly to investigate their hypothesis that down-regulation of protein synthesis is needed for neurulation? Further experiments are needed to mechanistically link Myc modulation to ribosome biogenesis and/or to better link ribosome/translational regulation with cell fate restriction, in order to make a more impactful paper.</p><p>3) The Myc OE mouse model complements previous LOF findings that Myc controls brain size and progenitors (albeit using a human transgene). The authors conclude that Myc OE increases proliferation and in their title link dynamic changes in protein synthesis to &quot;cell fate restriction.&quot; However, Myc OE phenotypes are only reported at later stages with analysis of only one neuronal marker, limiting the strength of the conclusions about cell fate restriction and proliferation. Are all neuronal layers affected? It would be important to demonstrate that Myc OE impacts proliferation and fate restriction at earlier relevant stages, E10.5-E12.5, when expression of Myc and ribosome/translation factors is reduced. <italic>Foxg1-cre/myc</italic> mice are also used which initiate c-myc expression early at e9.5 but there is little analysis of these embryos. In addition the data for Nestin-cre mice do not support the hypothesis that c-myc is driver of translation.</p><p>4) The reviewers would prefer that results related to Myc OE drives tumors in the choroid plexus is removed. These data diffuse the focus of the paper as the phenotypes and biology here are vastly different from early development. More attention on the early stages and requested experiments above would better strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Despite the enthusiasm, the requirements suggested to flesh out the story could take considerable time to complete. If you feel it is possible to address these concerns, we encourage you to resubmit a more complete story for full review at a later date.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript conceptually builds from the authors previous findings (Chau et al., 2015) that showed that the proteome of the amniotic fluid and early cerebrospinal fluid contains factors that promote placode and neural differentiation, respectively. The idea that arises in the current manuscript is that these factors derive from the developing neuroepithelium and the composition changes over time. Using RNA-seq, the authors profile the emerging forebrain in the mouse at E8.5 and E10.5. An added value of their analysis is the ability to compare the transcriptional datasets with their previous proteome analysis of the amniotic fluid and cerebrospinal fluid to make some inferences about signaling/reception and protein synthesis. The focus of the current manuscript is on the strong expression of ribosomal proteins at E8.5 and their downregulation by E10.5 as neurogenesis proceeds. It explores the role of MYC in this process using loss and gain of Myc expression. Together the manuscript presents novel and convincing data. Ultimately it is still somewhat correlative but the authors have done a nice job in highlighting the overall importance of MYC in the regulation of early development of the neuroepithelium and differentiation. These studies add to emerging work on the importance of translational regulation in the control of mammalian development and new concepts related to the exquisite control imposed on cell and tissue formation through specific ribosomal subunits.</p><p>The authors focus in on MYC as a possible upstream regulator. Most of the data in Figure 3 are solid but the JQ1 experiments are problematic in interpretation of a specific effect on Myc, as JQ1 is a broad epigenetic (bromodomain) inhibitor and alterations in a number of epigenetic regulators can lead to neural tube defects.</p><p>The results end on somewhat of a tangent and turns toward a cancer phenotype (which would be expected by MYC-OE) within the choroid plexus. Despite leading away from the main point, it is OK to retain this data as it shows a link between developmental and cancer pathways (again, not a surprise). However, since MYC overexpression is persistent through development, the following statement is incorrect or at best misleading: &quot;The appropriate downregulation of Myc after neurulation is essential to prevent early missteps of development that can manifest as later-onset diseases of the nervous system.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Here, Lehtinen and colleagues describe expression of ribosomal components and translation in neuroepithelial progenitors, which they associate with developmental restrictions in cell fate specification. Transcriptome analyses show down-regulation of these components between E8.5 and E10.5, which matches transcriptomes of the choroid plexus. This is parallel with changes in protein synthesis and proposed ribosome biogenesis. The authors suggest that reduced protein synthesis is required for differentiation to occur. They show that expression of Myc, a transcription factor implicated in ribosome biogenesis, correlates with these developmental profiles and demonstrate that in vivo Myc overexpression (Myc OE) perturbs brain development, increasing brain size and affecting neuronal markers. Myc OE in progenitors also drives tumors and alterations in translational machinery in the adult choroid plexus.</p><p>The main interesting concept put forth in this paper that ribosome biogenesis is developmentally regulated. Several additional concepts are intriguing: that CSF acquire translational components secreted from the neuroepithelium, and ribosome heterogeneity in progenitors (which has been suggested previously but poorly described). The data are of interest for those investigating neurulation and regulation of progenitor fate. However, in its current state, the paper is quite descriptive and somewhat unfocused, and the concepts described above could be better fleshed out.</p><p>1) Myc OE in apical progenitors is employed to support the idea that dynamic regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis is needed in neural progenitors over development. However, these data are largely correlative and it remains unclear mechanistically whether alterations in ribosomes and protein synthesis explain the Myc OE phenotypes.

Are all neuronal layers affected? It would be important to demonstrate that Myc OE impacts proliferation and fate restriction at earlier relevant stages, E10.5-E12.5, when expression of Myc and ribosome/translation factors is reduced.</p><p>3) The last two figures of the paper demonstrate Myc OE drives tumors in the choroid plexus and modifies translation markers in these adult stages. While I appreciate this helps support the link between Myc and ribosome regulation, given the phenotypes and biology here are vastly different from early development, these data diffuse the focus of the paper.</p><p>4) The conclusion that E8.5 neuroepithelial progenitors have higher ribosome biogenesis than E10.5 is based upon increased nucleolar volume (as a proxy) and EM analysis. The EM data need annotations and ideally immuno-gold to support the conclusion that punctae are actually ribosomes. It would be ideal if the authors could support their conclusion with standard molecular analysis of biogenesis- for example, are rRNA levels and/or processing different across development?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Chau et al. performed transcriptome analysis on forebrain e8.5 and e10.5 neuroepithelium and discovered that the protein biosynthetic machinery is down-regulated after neurulation. The authors then explore if c-myc regulates the expression of ribosomes and other translational machinery genes during neurulation. The work is extensive and the authors use a variety of state of the art techniques. Differential regulation of ribosomes and other translational machinery as a driver of neurulation is novel and could have a broad impact on our understanding of this important and complex morphogenetic process. While the initial transcriptional and proteomic experiments are performed well, the follow up analysis focusing on translation and the role of c-myc in the process are lacking.</p><p>The authors only directly examine whether protein synthesis is decreased post-neurulation (by the incorporation of OPP in Figure 2H) one time in the manuscript. The authors often use instead nucleolar data, which is interesting, but it is only correlative. A more direct examination of protein synthesis should also be performed on the c-myc knock-out and c-myc over-expression mice. Additional direct measurements of protein synthesis and functional ribosomes (monosomes vs. polysomes) are also needed in all instances to substantiate their findings.</p><p>The necessity of c-myc in coordinating the down-regulation of the protein synthesis machinery is also lacking. The authors use a conventional knock-out when a conditional knock-out might be more informative. The authors use JQ1 as an inhibitor of c-myc but concerns exist about the specificity of JQ1 for only c-myc. The authors could also use more standard and complementary systems that are likely to be more specific to test the necessity of c-myc. Unfortunately without these data, the author's conclusion (subsection “Critical timing of MYC expression during early forebrain development”, last paragraph) is not supported.</p><p>The over-expression studies are also lacking. The authors use an innovative c-myc line and two cre drivers (<italic>Nestin</italic> and <italic>Foxg1</italic>) but perform a detailed analysis for only the <italic>Nestin-cre</italic> driver. Unfortunately this does not seem to be the best mouse since c-myc is expression commences days after neurulation is complete. Instead the <italic>Foxg1-cre</italic>/myc mice seem better since c-myc expression initiates at e9.5 but the necessary studies are not performed. In addition the data for <italic>Nestin-cre</italic> mice do not support the hypothesis that c-myc is driver of translation and neurulation</p><p>C-myc also likely regulates many pathways, just not the protein synthesis machinery. Thus, the authors should also manipulate the translational machinery directly to investigate their hypothesis that down-regulation of protein synthesis is needed for neurulation.</p><p>Finally, a more minor concern, but still a possible significant problem, is that the difference in protein machinery expression could vary along the A-P and D-V/M-L axes. Since neurulation varies along the A-P axis and there are specific cell types along the M-L/D-V axis (hinge points, neural fold cells), differences could exist. Some data (Figure 2C) support this possibility. This caveat should be stated explicitly in the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Downregulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis during early forebrain development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Moreover, they make the case that c-MYC positively regulates ribosome biogenesis and that a consequence of c-MYC overexpression is an increase neuronal production and macrocephaly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add to the Discussion some technical caveats of monitoring translation in vivo (some of which were mentioned in the response to reviewers) and as discussed in detail in the next paragraph. Also in the Discussion please stage whether there could be a function of altered ribosome biogenesis independent of modulating translation.</p><p>While authors have strong evidence that ribosome signature (and biogenesis) changes during development (as described in a manuscript that was not cited Kraushar et al., 2015, but also in the cited Kraushar et al., 2016), authors do not provide strong evidence that they disrupted dynamics of protein synthesis due to ribosome and/or MYC changes. For example, RPL11 is known to sit at the monosome but not to associate with polysome, while during stress conditions it binds to the DNA promoter of p53 oncogene (Slavov, Cell Reports, 2015; Mahata et al., Ocogene, 2015). In addition, critical experiments testing protein synthesis (e.g. OPP injection or methionine analysis), in current state do not exclude possibility that different transcription dynamics play role in the observed OPP and methionine changes. Here, authors may consider an additional line of evidence – they may want to discuss discrepancies between levels of mRNA expression and matching protein these mRNAs encode (e.g. using qRT-PCR and western).</p><p>2) Please remove &quot;protein synthesis&quot; from the title. Since OPP was injected intraperitoneally, the availability of OPP to progenitors may be different between E8.5 and 10.5 (e.g. similar to decrease of a number of proteins in AF and CSF by E10.5). Overall, there is no strong experimental evidence that protein synthesis is downregulated in early progenitors, while it may also be easily upregulated for selective number of other mRNAs whose protein expression was not tested. For example, total levels of ribosomal proteins can decrease but their association with polysomes may increase (Kraushar et al., 2015, 2016). The same concern goes for not seeing consistent, significant differences in OPP incorporation in Myc<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Thus, it is critical to either remove &quot;protein synthesis&quot; from their title or perform additional experiments (e.g. experiments focusing on protein synthesis where transcription is transiently inhibited at its minimum).</p><p>3) Using immunohistochemistry, the authors show significant decrease for a number of ribosome biogenesis players and ribosomal proteins. Is there a ribosome protein that did not change or maybe even increased? These possible additional findings would be in line with EM pictures and EM analysis that clearly show large number of ribosomes in apical progenitors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36998.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers expressed enthusiasm for the conceptual advance and the timeliness of the studies. They acknowledge how these studies add to emerging work on the importance of translational regulation in the control of mammalian development and new concepts related to the control imposed on cell and tissue formation through specific ribosomal subunits. They also appreciate the variety of state of the art techniques and the initial transcriptional and proteomic experiments. However, in its current state, the paper is quite descriptive, somewhat correlative, the follow up analysis focusing on translation and the role of c-Myc in the process are lacking, and the manuscript is unfocused at the end.</p><p>The full reviews are attached below. A synopsis of the major critiques is outlined in the following 4 points.</p><p>1) The authors only directly examine whether protein synthesis is decreased post-neurulation (by the incorporation of OPP in Figure 2H) one time in the manuscript. The authors often use instead increased nucleolar volume (as a proxy) and EM analysis. The EM data need annotations and ideally immuno-gold to support the conclusion that punctae are actually ribosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we provide larger, annotated, representative EM images of from E8.5 and E10.5 neural progenitor cells (Figure 2K). We quantified the number of ribosomes and other organelles occupying the cytoplasmic space in neural precursors and found that the E8.5 cells contain more ribosomes per defined area of cytoplasm than E10.5 progenitors (Figure 2L), though ribosome density within the free cytoplasmic space, per se, was not different between these two ages (Figure 2M). In addition, more E10.5 cytoplasm than E8.5 cytoplasm was occupied by other organelles including endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and Golgi (Figure 2N), indicating an overall shift in organelle landscape at this age.</p><p>We are confident that the punctae in our images are ribosomes, and based on morphological characteristics, are very unlikely to be any other structures. For example glycogen, which we often observe in our EM analyses of other cell types such as choroid plexus epithelial cells, is larger, more irregular in shape, aggregates more, and is typically more electron dense. We consulted with additional experts on ribosomes and EM in the HMS community including:</p><p>Maria Ericsson (manager, Harvard Medical School EM Facility, where we perform our EM analyses)</p><p>Mark Fleming, MD, DPhil (Boston Children’s Hospital; e.g. Nguyen et al., Science 2017)</p><p>Wei-Chung Lee, PhD (HMS/BCH Neurobiology; Lee et al., <underline>Nature</underline> 2016)</p><p>These experts agree that the punctae in our samples are ribosomes. In addition, there was a general consensus that because our samples are so packed with ribosomes, immuno-gold EM would be problematic to interpret since the overall signal would likely be too strong/saturated. Together with our revised representative images and quantification (see above), we hope the reviewers will agree that ribosome biogenesis is decreased in the E8.5 to E10.5 forebrain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be ideal if the authors could support their conclusion with standard molecular analysis of biogenesis – for example, are rRNA levels and/or processing different across development – and/or other direct measurements of protein synthesis and functional ribosomes (monosomes vs. polysomes).</p></disp-quote><p>We reached out to Debby Silver (Duke University), to discuss this point and to get her advice on reagents that may work well in the developing forebrain at these early ages. The Silver lab kindly shared FISH probes against 5.8S pre-rRNA and 5.8S total rRNA (Pilaz et al.,), which reveal more rRNA signal in E8.5 than E10.5 progenitors. These new data are shown in new Figure 2F, 2G.</p><p>We purchased the Y10b antibody used by many labs in the field (e.g. Kondrashov et al., 2011) and found that it, too, showed stronger immunofluorescence signal in E8.5 progenitors than E10.5 progenitors. These new data are shown in new Figure 2H.</p><p>We quantified <sup>35</sup>S-methionine incorporation in vitro in forebrain progenitors, and observed higher <sup>35</sup>S-methionine incorporation at E8.5 compared to E10.5 (counts per million cells, presented as E8.5 fold change normalized to E10.5 forebrain: Expt. 1 = 2.0-fold; Expt. 2 = 1.4-fold; Expt. 3 = 1.1-fold), indicative of a higher protein synthesis rate in E8.5 forebrain progenitor cells. These new data are described in the last paragraph of the subsection “Decreased ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in E10.5 neuroepithelium”. We have also added a new author to our study, Anoop Sendamarai (Fleming lab, BCH/HMS), as we collaborated with a lab with specific expertise in performing this experiment and that had a radioactivity license.</p><p>We reached out to experts in the Harvard Medical School community regarding the technical requirements for analyzing monosomes and polysomes. From our pilot dissections and discussions with Drs. Dan Finley and Mark Fleming (e.g. Nguyen et al., Science 2017), we have concluded that these analyses are technically not feasible given the very limited amounts of E8.5 presumptive forebrain that can be micro-dissected across similarly staged embryos and pooled across multiple litters of mice. However, as we provide new data for the rest of the points raised above, we hope that the reviewers agree that our manuscript is strengthened by the inclusion of these new data and that polysome profiling is not necessary to demonstrate that ribosome biogenesis is downregulated from E8.5 to E10.5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Myc OE in apical progenitors is employed to support the idea that dynamic regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis is needed in neural progenitors over development. However, these data are largely correlative and it remains unclear mechanistically whether alterations in ribosomes and protein synthesis explain the Myc OE phenotypes. Although Myc has been previously linked to ribosome biogenesis, this transcription factor has other functions, for example in associating with and impacting cell cycle regulators. Thus, the described alterations in brain size, Pax6+ S phase cells, and Cux1 number could be due to cell cycle alterations, potentially independent of ribosome regulation. Consistent with this possibility, Myc OE embryonic brains exhibit only a slight increase in ribosome biogenesis and no significant alterations in translation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that MYC has many roles in the cells, and that the large brain phenotype observed is very likely due to a combination of MYC’s effects on multiple signaling pathways. For example, MYC overexpression also led to the upregulation of genes involved with cell proliferation. For example, we observed upregulation of <italic>Igf2</italic> and <italic>Insm1</italic> in MYC-expressing progenitors. IGF2 regulates proliferation of cortical progenitor cells (e.g. Lehtinen et al., 2011), and <italic>Insm1</italic> is a transcription factor with roles in promoting the delamination of apical progenitors cells, thereby accelerating cortical development by promoting the formation of basal progenitors (e.g. Farkas et al., 2008; Tavano et al., 2018). We clarify this point in the first paragraph of the subsection “Persistent MYC expression increases progenitor proliferation, leading to macrocephaly”.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added new experiments quantifying ribosome biogenesis (via Fibrillarin staining) in <italic>Foxg1:MYC</italic> mice as well as wild type mice treated with MYC inhibitor or vehicle control. These new, gain- and loss-of-function data, shown in new Figure 5E, 5M, confirm MYC’s modest but consistent regulation of ribosome biogenesis at this early stage of forebrain development. We performed analyses of OPP incorporation in <italic>Foxg1:MYC</italic> and <italic>Nestin:MYC</italic> as well as <italic>Myc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. In these analyses, we did not see consistent, significant differences in OPP incorporation, demonstrating MYC-regulation of ribosome biogenesis does not drive protein synthesis in these cells and that other mechanisms exist to regulate these processes. We mention these data in the last paragraph of the subsection “MYC modulates ribosome biogenesis in developing forebrain”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The JQ1 experiments are problematic in interpretation of a specific effect on Myc, as JQ1 is a broad epigenetic (bromodomain) inhibitor and alterations in a number of epigenetic regulators can lead to neural tube defects.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the previous JQ1 data from the revised manuscript. We present instead new data using a more specific MYC inhibitor (KJ-Pyr-9;Hart et al., 2014)and found that intraperitoneal delivery to the pregnant dam reduced nucleolar volume quantified by Fibrillarin staining. These new data are presented in new Figure 5E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors build a case that better supports the title of the paper with additional ways of manipulating translational machinery directly to investigate their hypothesis that down-regulation of protein synthesis is needed for neurulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the text to clarify that our goal is <italic>not</italic> to investigate the process of neurulation. We also expand our studies to include new analyses of the mTOR signaling pathway, which is also downregulated between E8.5 and E10.5. These new data are presented in new Figure 3. In parallel, we also tested the consequences of maternal rapamycin injection during this early stage of development. In our injections of n=5 litters, we did not observe neural tube defects, though cannot rule out that they may occur. We have revised the Discussion section in the manuscript and hope that our revised Discussion clarifies these important points to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further experiments are needed to mechanistically link Myc modulation to ribosome biogenesis and/or to better link ribosome/translational regulation with cell fate restriction, in order to make a more impactful paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional experiments to demonstrate MYC’s contributions to ribosome biogenesis by using (1) Selective MYC inhibitor KJ-Pyr-9 (see above), and (2) quantifying ribosome biogenesis in <italic>Foxg1-MYC</italic> mice, which has larger nucleoli. We clarified in the text that changes in ribosome biogenesis and MYC expression take place concurrently as neural progenitor progress to more lineage-committed fates. In the longer term, we observe a large brain phenotype in the mice, which may be due to a combination of MYCs actions on downstream signaling pathways (e.g. ribosomes but also enhanced expression of factors with known roles in development including <italic>Igf2</italic> and <italic>Insm1</italic>; see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Myc OE mouse model complements previous LOF findings that Myc controls brain size and progenitors (albeit using a human transgene). The authors conclude that Myc OE increases proliferation and in their title link dynamic changes in protein synthesis to &quot;cell fate restriction.&quot; However, Myc OE phenotypes are only reported at later stages with analysis of only one neuronal marker, limiting the strength of the conclusions about cell fate restriction and proliferation. Are all neuronal layers affected?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we performed additional analyses on cell cycle at earlier ages (E11.5) in <italic>Foxg1-MYC</italic> mice, but did not see significant differences in proliferation, consistent with the modest increase in brain size at E14.5. We also analyzed the cell identities contributing to the cerebral cortex in <italic>Nestin-MYC</italic> mice at P0 and P8. We binned the cortex into equal segments, and quantified the numbers of cells expressing the following laminar markers: Cux1 and Ctip2. At P0, we observed significantly more Cux1+ upper-layer neurons in the cortex of MYC-OE (Figure 6K, p≤0.01) but no difference in the number of Ctip2+ lower layer neurons (p=0.82). At P8, we also observed more Cux1+ neurons in MYC-OE, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.22). We did not observe differences in numbers of Ctip2+ neurons at P8 (p=0.96). These data suggest that the combinatorial effects of MYC overexpression most readily influence the later stages of neurogenesis, when upper layer neurons of the cerebral cortex are formed. However, we cannot rule out more subtle effects of cortical development that are not evaluated by these types of assays, or at the ages examined in this study. Our new data are included in the last paragraph of the subsection “Persistent MYC expression increases progenitor proliferation, leading to macrocephaly”. In the revised manuscript, we have focused on ribosome biogenesis during early stages of development and have shifted focus away from cell fate restriction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be important to demonstrate that Myc OE impacts proliferation and fate restriction at earlier relevant stages, E10.5-E12.5, when expression of Myc and ribosome/translation factors is reduced.

In addition the data for Nestin-cre mice do not support the hypothesis that c-myc is driver of translation.</p></disp-quote><p>We carried out the requested quantification of cell proliferation in <italic>Foxg1-MYC</italic> mice at E11.5, but did not observe a significant difference in proliferation, consistent with the modest increase in brain size at E14.5. <italic>Foxg1-MYC</italic> mice are embryonic lethal beginning soon after E14.5, preventing further analyses at later ages.

Despite leading away from the main point, it is OK to retain this data as it shows a link between developmental and cancer pathways (again, not a surprise). However, since MYC overexpression is persistent through development, the following statement is incorrect or at best misleading: &quot;The appropriate downregulation of Myc after neurulation is essential to prevent early missteps of development that can manifest as later-onset diseases of the nervous system.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>As described above in our response to Major critique #4, we have removed the choroid plexus tumor portion of the study from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Myc OE in apical progenitors is employed to support the idea that dynamic regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis is needed in neural progenitors over development.

As we showed in the initial manuscript submission (with <italic>Nestin:MYC</italic> mice), MYC overexpression also did not result in clear upregulation of protein synthesis. We describe these observations in the last paragraph of the subsection “MYC modulates ribosome biogenesis in developing forebrain”. These observations differ from our hypothesis, which was formed based on findings in the cancer literature. Given our findings, we have focused the contributions of Myc expression in our study to be on ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>We also reached out to experts in the Harvard Medical School community regarding the technical requirements for analyzing monosomes and polysomes. From our pilot dissections and discussions with Drs. Dan Finley and Mark Fleming (e.g. Nguyen et al., Science 2017), we have concluded that these analyses are technically not feasible given the very limited amounts of E8.5 presumptive forebrain that can be micro-dissected across similarly staged embryos and pooled across multiple litters of mice. However, as we provide new data for the rest of the points raised above, we hope that the reviewers agree that our manuscript is improved and that polysome profiling is not necessary to demonstrate that ribosome biogenesis is downregulated from E8.5 to E10.5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The necessity of c-myc in coordinating the down-regulation of the protein synthesis machinery is also lacking. The authors use a conventional knock-out when a conditional knock-out might be more informative. The authors use JQ1 as an inhibitor of c-myc but concerns exist about the specificity of JQ1 for only c-myc. The authors could also use more standard and complementary systems that are likely to be more specific to test the necessity of c-myc. Unfortunately without these data, the author's conclusion (subsection “Critical timing of MYC expression during early forebrain development”, last paragraph) is not supported.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer #1 raised concerns about the JQ1 MYC inhibitor due to its broader role as a bromodomain inhibitor, we have removed the previous JQ1 data from the revised manuscript. We present new data using KJ-Pyr-9, a more specific MYC inhibitorand found that intraperitoneal delivery to the pregnant dam reduced nucleolar volume quantified by Fibrillarin staining. These new data are presented in Figure 5E in the revised manuscript. These findings are in agreement with our data showing the <italic>Myc</italic>-deficient mice have smaller nucleoli as well (Figure 5F). While we do have the conditional <italic>Myc</italic> knockout mouse in lab, the field lacks a Cre driver line that would induce Cre recombination specifically in the neuroepithelium at the critical time point in development, just before neurulation. In the revised manuscript, we have removed the section regarding neural tube closure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The over-expression studies are also lacking. The authors use an innovative c-myc line and two cre drivers (Nestin and Foxg1) but perform a detailed analysis for only the Nestin-cre driver. Unfortunately this does not seem to be the best mouse since c-myc is expression commences days after neurulation is complete. Instead the Foxg1-cre/myc mice seem better since c-myc expression initiates at e9.5 but the necessary studies are not performed. In addition the data for Nestin-cre mice do not support the hypothesis that c-myc is driver of translation and neurulation.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have now performed additional analyses of nucleolar size and OPP incorporation in the <italic>Foxg1:MYC</italic> mice. We found that MYC expression in this line also resulted in increased nucleolar size (new Figure 5M), but as mentioned above, we did not observe differences in OPP incorporation (included in the last paragraph of the subsection “MYC modulates ribosome biogenesis in developing forebrain”). We agree with the reviewer that based on these findings, MYC does not appear to be a driver of translation in this system, although there may be other regulatory steps including accessibility to chromatin contributing to these results. We discuss this point in the Discussion section as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C-myc also likely regulates many pathways, just not the protein synthesis machinery. Thus, the authors should also manipulate the translational machinery directly to investigate their hypothesis that down-regulation of protein synthesis is needed for neurulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Myc has many roles and likely contributes to brain development in number of ways. We have rewritten the text to clarify that our goal is not to investigate the process of neurulation. We also expand our studies to include new analyses of the mTOR signaling pathway, which is also downregulated between E8.5 and E10.5. These new data are presented in new Figure 3. In parallel, we also tested the consequences of maternal rapamycin injection to inhibit the mTOR signaling pathway during this early stage of development. In our injections of n=5 litters, we did not observe neural tube defects, though cannot rule out that they may occur with different doses or other modifications to the protocol. We have revised the Discussion section in the manuscript and hope that our revised Discussion clarifies these important points to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, a more minor concern, but still a possible significant problem, is that the difference in protein machinery expression could vary along the A-P and D-V/M-L axes. Since neurulation varies along the A-P axis and there are specific cell types along the M-L/D-V axis (hinge points, neural fold cells), differences could exist. Some data (Figure 2C) support this possibility. This caveat should be stated explicitly in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting and important point. We have included this in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add to the Discussion some technical caveats of monitoring translation in vivo (some of which were mentioned in the response to reviewers) and as discussed in detail in the next paragraph. Also in the Discussion please stage whether there could be a function of altered ribosome biogenesis independent of modulating translation.</p><p>While authors have strong evidence that ribosome signature (and biogenesis) changes during development (as described in a manuscript that was not cited Kraushar et al., 2015, but also in the cited Kraushar et al., 2016), authors do not provide strong evidence that they disrupted dynamics of protein synthesis due to ribosome and/or MYC changes. For example, RPL11 is known to sit at the monosome but not to associate with polysome, while during stress conditions it binds to the DNA promoter of p53 oncogene (Slavov, Cell Reports, 2015; Mahata et al., Ocogene, 2015). In addition, critical experiments testing protein synthesis (e.g. OPP injection or methionine analysis), in current state do not exclude possibility that different transcription dynamics play role in the observed OPP and methionine changes. Here, authors may consider an additional line of evidence – they may want to discuss discrepancies between levels of mRNA expression and matching protein these mRNAs encode (e.g. using qRT-PCR and western).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new paragraph to the Discussion section to address these concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please remove &quot;protein synthesis&quot; from the title. Since OPP was injected intraperitoneally, the availability of OPP to progenitors may be different between E8.5 and 10.5 (e.g. similar to decrease of a number of proteins in AF and CSF by E10.5). Overall, there is no strong experimental evidence that protein synthesis is downregulated in early progenitors, while it may also be easily upregulated for selective number of other mRNAs whose protein expression was not tested. For example, total levels of ribosomal proteins can decrease but their association with polysomes may increase (Kraushar et al., 2015, 2016). The same concern goes for not seeing consistent, significant differences in OPP incorporation in Myc<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Thus, it is critical to either remove &quot;protein synthesis&quot; from their title or perform additional experiments (e.g. experiments focusing on protein synthesis where transcription is transiently inhibited at its minimum).</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed “protein synthesis” from the title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Using immunohistochemistry, the authors show significant decrease for a number of ribosome biogenesis players and ribosomal proteins. Is there a ribosome protein that did not change or maybe even increased? These possible additional findings would be in line with EM pictures and EM analysis that clearly show large number of ribosomes in apical progenitors.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our RNAseq data, ribosomal proteins that are not differentially expressed between E8.5 and E10.5 include:</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">ID</td><td valign="top">E8.5 FPKM</td><td valign="top">E10.5 FPKM</td><td valign="top">Fold_change (log2)</td><td valign="top">Sig</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Rpl13a</italic> </td><td valign="top">481.511</td><td valign="top">718.452</td><td valign="top">0.577324</td><td valign="top">no</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Rpl7a</italic> </td><td valign="top">1405.23</td><td valign="top">1227.52</td><td valign="top">-0.195062</td><td valign="top">no</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Rpsa</italic> </td><td valign="top">368.641</td><td valign="top">292.213</td><td valign="top">-0.335194</td><td valign="top">no</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Rpl4</italic> </td><td valign="top">1519.98</td><td valign="top">1168.83</td><td valign="top">-0.378986</td><td valign="top">no</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Using immunoblotting, we found that RPL10A, which has higher RNA expression at E8.5 (<italic>Rpl10a</italic> FPKM: E8.5 = 1962.03; E10.5 = 1242.73), has comparable protein expression between E8.5 and E10.5.
