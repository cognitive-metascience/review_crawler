However, the functional role of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia, as well as the mechanism of its induction, are poorly understood. Here we report that the genetic ablation of signal regulatory protein Î± (SIRPÎ±), a membrane protein, induced the emergence of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in the brain white matter. Mice lacking CD47, a physiological ligand of SIRPÎ±, and microglia-specific SIRPÎ±-knockout mice exhibited the same phenotype, suggesting that an interaction between microglial SIRPÎ± and CD47 on neighbouring cells suppressed the emergence of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia. A lack of SIRPÎ± did not cause detectable damage to the white matter, but resulted in the increased expression of genes whose expression is characteristic of the repair phase after demyelination. In addition, cuprizone-induced demyelination was alleviated by the microglia-specific ablation of SIRPÎ±. Thus, microglial SIRPÎ± suppresses the induction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia that have the potential to accelerate the repair of damaged white matter.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>white matter</kwd><kwd>tissue repair</kwd><kwd>demyelination</kwd><kwd>CD11c</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26111703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohnishi</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24111508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohnishi</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26670110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohnishi</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16K15189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato-Hashimoto</surname><given-names>Miho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25430062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato-Hashimoto</surname><given-names>Miho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006680</institution-id><institution>Takeda Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato-Hashimoto</surname><given-names>Miho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cell-cell contact between microglial SIRPÎ± and CD47 on neighboring cells is a critical module for phase conversion of microglia in the brain white matter and controls demyelination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia constantly survey the microenvironment of the brain. When microglia encounter tissue damage, they become activated, produce multiple humoral factors and show enhanced phagocytic activity; microglia thus play a central role in the removal and repair of damaged tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kettenmann et al., 2011</xref>). However, the excessive activation of microglia results in the progression of inflammation and tissue degeneration, which is harmful to the brain environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kettenmann et al., 2011</xref>). The activation of microglia has been reported in various neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries, including Alzheimerâs disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and demyelinating diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holtman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamphuis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Remington et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In animal models of these disorders, a characteristic subset of microglia that express integrin Î±X or CD11c, a marker of murine peripheral dendritic cells and selected macrophages, appear in the affected brain regions. The expression of CD11c is a marker for âprimedâ microglia that are not fully activated but rather are in a pre-activation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holtman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Norden and Godbout, 2013</xref>). The appearance of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia hasÂ also beenÂ reported during postnatal development and normal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bulloch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaunzner et al., 2012</xref>). In both cases, CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia characteristically appeared in the brain white matter, where myelin construction during the late developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumann and Pham-Dinh, 2001</xref>) or theÂ accumulation of damaged myelin debris during aging were remarkable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Safaiyan et al., 2016</xref>). It was also shown that demyelination markedly induced CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia, even in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Remington et al., 2007</xref>), but this induction was suppressed in mutant mice lacking Trem2 or Cx3Cr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lampron et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poliani et al., 2015</xref>), whichÂ are functional molecules that promote phagocytosis. Of note, the clearance of myelin debris was markedly impaired in these mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cantoni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lampron et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poliani et al., 2015</xref>). CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia also accumulate around amyloid plaques in an AD mouse model thatÂ has gene expression patterns indicating an enhanced capacity for phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamphuis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). TheÂ phagocytic ability of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia thus might contribute to the removal and repair of damaged tissues. However, the physiological roles of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia, as well as the mechanisms controling the induction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia, are not fully understood.</p><p>SIRPÎ± (CD172a) is a membrane protein thatÂ isÂ highly expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells. The extracellular region of SIRPÎ± specifically interacts with another membrane protein CD47 to promote cellâcell contact signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matozaki et al., 2009</xref>). Interactions between SIRPÎ± on phagocytic cells and CD47 on phagocytosed targets, such as erythrocytes, cancer cells, and apoptotic cells, act as a âdonât eat meâ signal and thereby control erythrocyte homeostasis, elimination of cancer cells, and the formation of arteriosclerotic plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishikawa-Sekigami et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kojima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willingham et al., 2012</xref>). In the brain, SIRPÎ± and CD47 are abundantly expressed on neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohnishi et al., 2010</xref>), and SIRPÎ± is also expressed on microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gitik et al., 2011</xref>). It is assumed that SIRPÎ± on microglia interacts with neuronal CD47 to suppress microglial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saijo and Glass, 2011</xref>), because SIRPÎ± contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barclay and Hatherley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matozaki et al., 2009</xref>). However, direct in vivo evidence supporting this model is missing. Here, we analysed the role of SIRPÎ± in the control of microglial activation using CD47âSIRPÎ± signal-deficient mice and defined a critical microglia control module. Specifically, our results establish that SIRPÎ± on microglia controls cell activation through the interaction with its ligand CD47 and negatively regulates the induction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia, which have the potential to support the repair of damaged myelin, in white but not inÂ grey matter.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Emergence of CD11c<sup>+</sup>microglia in the brain white matter of SIRPÎ±-deficient mice</title><p>To examine the role of SIRPÎ± in microglial activation, brains of SIRPÎ± knockout (KO) mice were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies specific to Iba1, a microglia marker, and to CD68, a marker for phagocytically active microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). TheÂ numbers of Iba1<sup>+</sup>cellsÂ as well asÂ ofÂ Iba1<sup>+</sup>/CD68<sup>+</sup> cells in the white matter, such as the fimbria, were significantly increased in the brains of SIRPÎ± KO miceÂ compared with thoseÂ ofÂ wild-type (WT) control mice, suggesting the activation of microglia in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). TheÂ activation of microglia in the white matter of SIRPÎ± KO miceÂ was similar to the phenotype reported in aged mice, in which numbers of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia were reported to be increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaunzner et al., 2012</xref>). Next, we examined the effect of the genetic ablation of SIRPÎ± on the expression of CD11c by microglia by using CD11câEYFP transgenic (Tg) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lindquist et al., 2004</xref>), in which the expression of CD11c is detected with the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein reporter gene. The numbers of Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells and EYFP<sup>+</sup> cells were markedly increased in the white matterÂ (including the corpus callosum, external capsule, fimbria, and internal capsule)Â of SIRPÎ± KO:CD11câEYFP Tg miceÂ whenÂ compared with thatÂ ofÂ control SIRPÎ± WT:CD11c-EYFP Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

However, direct evidence for the function of this module in theÂ physiological context had not yetÂ been provided. In this study, we demonstrated that SIRPÎ± is a key molecule for the suppression of microglia activation in vivo. Microglia-specific SIRPÎ± cKO mice exhibited the same phenotype as SIRPÎ± null KO mice. Therefore, SIRPÎ± proteins that are expressed on microglia directlyÂ control microglia activation and the induction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in vivo. The emergence of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in the brains of microglia-specific SIRPÎ±Â cKO mice establishes that CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia are derived from resident microglia in the brain, and areÂ not recruited monocytes that are spared in the TAM-induced system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Safaiyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wolf et al., 2013</xref>).

Molecules other than CD47, such as surfactant protein-A and -D (SP-A, SP-D), have also been reported as SIRPÎ± ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matozaki et al., 2009</xref>). However, we found that CD47 KO mice exhibited a phenotype similar to that of SIRPÎ± KO mice, suggesting that the CD47âSIRPÎ± interaction is indeed important for the suppression of microglia activation in the brain. Interestingly,Â the number of Iba1-positive cells in theÂ fimbria ofÂ CD47 KOÂ miceÂ was greater than that in SIRPÎ± null KO or cKO mice, whereas the number of CD11c/Iba1 double-positive cells was comparable in CD47 KO and SIRPÎ± cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).Â TheÂ CD47 signal may have aÂ SIRPÎ±-independent function that suppresses the proliferation of microglia.</p><p>We found that the cell-surface expression of SIRPÎ± was significantly increased in microglia prepared from CD47 KO mice. Conversely, the expression of CD47 in microglia was also increased in SIRPÎ±Â KO mice. Lack ofÂ interaction between CD47 and SIRPÎ± may result in the upregulated expression of SIRPÎ± or CD47 in microglia as aÂ compensatory response, or in theÂ stabilization of theÂ CD47âSIRPÎ±Â complex on microglia, because our previous study suggested that the interaction between CD47 and SIRPÎ± induced endocytosis of the CD47âSIRPÎ± complex in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusakari et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>It remains unclear which cell type expressed theÂ CD47 that contributed to the suppression of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia. It hasÂ been proposed that CD47 thatÂ isÂ expressed on neurons suppresses the activation of microglia through interactions with SIRPÎ±Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ransohoff and Cardona, 2010</xref>). An in vitro study suggested that CD47 on myelin sheets interacted with SIRPÎ± and suppressed microglial phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gitik et al., 2011</xref>). Another study reported that direct cellâcell contact between astrocytes and microglia suppressed the expression of CD11c on microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acevedo et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, CD47 on oligodendrocytes or astrocytes may also participate in the suppression of microglia activation. In addition, microgliaâmicroglia interaction through theÂ CD47âSIRPÎ± signal or cis-interaction between CD47 and SIRPÎ± on the same microglia is another possibility. Supporting this, our preliminary results showed that microglial CD47 was increased in microglia-specific SIRPÎ± cKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Further research with cell type-specific CD47 conditional KO mice is required to clarify which cell type is involved in the CD47-mediated effects.</p><p>CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia are increased during neurodegenerative damage as well as in aging and duringÂ theÂ postnatal development of normal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bulloch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaunzner et al., 2012</xref>).

This suggested that the phenotype in the mutant mice was similar to theÂ normal biological responses in the aged brain. Although the maturation-dependent downregulation of CD47 was shown in hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>), the age-dependent reduction of CD47 has not been reported in the brain. In addition, our data suggested that the cell-surface expression of SIRPÎ± was not decreased in microglia from aged mice. Thus, the age-dependent dysfunction of CD47âSIRPÎ± signals was unlikely. The increase in the number of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in aged brains may be explained by the age-dependent accumulation of tissue damage that stimulates microglia activation beyond the suppressive ability of SIRPÎ±.</p><p>We demonstrated that CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia were specifically increased in the white matter of mutant mice. Thus, the white matter may contain an endogenous factor that promotes the induction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in mutant mice. One potential candidate is myelin. As reported,Â CD11c<sup>+</sup>Â microglia were increased in control SIRPÎ±-flox:â mice after Cpz treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poliani et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, myelin damage effectively induces CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia even in the control mice. This suggests that myelin degradation products that are formed during homeostatic turnover of the myelin structure might stimulate the induction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in CD47âSIRPÎ± signal-deficient mice, whereas the effect of such homeostatic degradation of myelin may be suppressed by SIRPÎ± in the normal mouse brain. Enhanced phagocytosis of myelin components by microglia may be involved in the induction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in our mutant mice, because SIRPÎ± negatively regulated phagocytosis in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matozaki et al., 2009</xref>).Â CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in SIRPÎ±-deficient mice expressed CD68, CD14, andÂ Dectin-1, whichÂ areÂ markers of phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Devitt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shah et al., 2008</xref>), supporting the notion that phagocytic activity was increased in these cells.</p><p>Several studies have suggested the importance of myelin phagocytosis by microglia for the induction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia during demyelination or aging. The myelin-damage-dependent induction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia was markedly suppressed in mutant mice lacking Trem2, a phagocytic receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poliani et al., 2015</xref>). The emergence of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia during demyelination was also suppressed in Cx3cr1 KO mice, in which the phagocytosis of myelin debris by microglia was severely impeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lampron et al., 2015</xref>). In the brain of aged mice, the accumulation of myelin debris and theÂ phagocytosis of such components by microglia were increased in the white matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Safaiyan et al., 2016</xref>), where CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia were characteristically observed in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hart et al., 2012</xref>). Of note, the aging-induced expansion of microglia in the corpus callosum was suppressed in Trem2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poliani et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, an in vitro study suggested that the presence of SIRPÎ± on microglia inhibited the phagocytosis of myelin membrane fractions through interactions with CD47 on myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gitik et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, our present data support the model inÂ which the lack of CD47âSIRPÎ± signal upregulates the phagocytosis of microglia, which become hypersensitive to the homeostatic destruction of myelin structures during the normal turnover process, and thereby triggers the induction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia without damage.</p><p>Transcriptome analyses showed that the expression of TNF-Î± (<italic>Tnfa</italic>), a proinflammatory cytokine, was increased 2â3-fold in the brain monocytes isolated from CD47 KO mice. In addition, pathway analysis showed thatÂ other genes related to theÂ TNF and NF-Îº B signaling pathway, including RelA (<italic>Rela</italic>) and IKKB (<italic>Ikbkb</italic>), were specifically increased in the mutant brain cells. Thus, it is likely that theÂ proinflammatory TNF axis is strengthened in microglia by the lack of CD47âSIRPÎ±Â signal. In contrast,Â theÂ Wnt signal pathway, which contributes to the proinflammatory transformation of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halleskog et al., 2011</xref>), was attenuated in the CD47 KO brain cells. The transcriptome analysis also showed that theÂ expression of TGF-Î²1 (<italic>Tgfb1</italic>), an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and ofÂ brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<italic>Bdnf</italic>), a neuroprotective factor, was increased in the CD47 KO brain cells. Thus, it is not clear whether CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in the mutant mice have pro- or anti-inflammatory roles.</p><p>The expression of genes that are characteristically expressed during the recovery phase from demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holtman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poliani et al., 2015</xref>), such as <italic>Itgax</italic>, <italic>Igf1</italic>, <italic>Lpl</italic>, <italic>Apoc1</italic>, <italic>Ch25h</italic>, <italic>Mmp12</italic>, <italic>Spp1</italic>, and <italic>Cst7,</italic> wasÂ increased in both the white matter and the brain cells of CD47 KO mice, suggesting their upregulation in the white matter CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia, and also suggesting the potential of the CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia to promote white-matter tissue repair. Consistently, after 5 wks of Cpz feeding,Â both demyelination and microgliosis were significantly reduced in SIRPÎ± cKO mice. Although the direct involvement of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in the reduction of demyelination damage in the mutant mice is not yet clear, CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia are likely to be effective in protecting against Cpz-induced demyelination. IGF-1 and Spp1Â were increased in the white matter and brain mononuclear cells of CD47 KO mice. These factors areÂ derived from microglia and support the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Selvaraju et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zeger et al., 2007</xref>). CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in neonatal brains haveÂ been reported toÂ be the major source of IGF-1 and to support primary myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wlodarczyk et al., 2017</xref>). In our mutant mice,Â CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia may facilitate white-matter repair through the function of these factors. Although Cpz feeding similarly induced CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in both control and SIRPÎ± cKO mice, the preceding existence of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in SIRPÎ± cKO mice inÂ the basal condition may enable these cells to respond to the damage earlierÂ and mayÂ accelerate tissue repair through their protective effect. It is also possible that the protective function of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia may be enhanced in SIRPÎ±-deficient CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia whenÂ comparedÂ with wild-type CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia. Further studies to compare the characteristics of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in Cpz-treated control and SIRPÎ± cKO mice will provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying the microglial SIRPÎ±-dependent control of myelin damage.</p><p>During the recovery phase (after two weeks ofÂ feeding with normal chow), the size of theÂ Iba1-positive area tended to be smaller in SIRPÎ± cKO mice than in control mice, although this difference was not statistically signficant. This may be due to the relatively small number ofÂ experiments studying this time point. Further detailed studies are required to clarify the function of microglial SIRPÎ±Â in the recovery phase of demyelination.</p><p>The loss and recovery of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells were comparable in control and SIRPÎ± cKO mice during de- and re-myelination. Cell death and restorative proliferation of the oligodendrocyte linage thus seems to occur to a similar extent in the two groups. The alleviated demyelination in SIRPÎ±Â cKO mice may be explained by the faster differentiation and/or maturation of oligodendrocytes in these mice when compared with control mice, resulting in accelerated remyelination in the cKO mice. Another possibility is that both the cell death and restorative proliferation of oligodendrocytes were suppressed in SIRPÎ±Â cKO mice, resulting in less damage thanÂ in control mice. In this case, the total number of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cellsÂ (the summation of surviving and proliferating Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells)Â in SIRPÎ±Â cKO mice would be comparable to thatÂ inÂ control mice, in which both the loss and restoration of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells were much greater than in cKO mice, with greater demyelination.</p><p>Our data suggest a supportive role for CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in tissue repair. Consistently, the suppression of the emergence of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia by the genetic ablation of Trem2 was concurrent with exacerbated neuronal damage in demyelination model mice or neuronal death and amyloid deposition in AD model mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poliani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Since CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia are characteristically observed in several neurodegenerative diseasesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holtman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamphuis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Remington et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2015</xref>),Â theÂ CD47âSIRPÎ± signal may be widely involved in theÂ pathology of degenerative brain diseases through the control of the protective function of microglia. The emergence of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in aged brain might also be an adaptive reaction to the tissue damage caused by aging. It is also notable that theÂ gene sets thatÂ wereÂ increased in the white matter of CD47 KO mice (i.e. <italic>Itgax, lpl, Cst7, Clec7a, Trem2</italic>, and <italic>Tyrobp</italic>) were similar to those increased in DAM (disease-associated microglia), a potential protective microglia subtype associated with neurodegenerativeÂ conditions such as AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keren-Shaul et al., 2017</xref>). CD47âSIRPÎ± interactions may be a key mechanism for the induction of protective microglia such as DAM.</p><p>The reduction of demyelination in Cpz-treated SIRPÎ± cKO mice is in contrast to theÂ persistent demyelination thatÂ occursÂ after Cpz treatment in Trem2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poliani et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the enhanced expression of <italic>Itgax</italic>, <italic>Igf1</italic>, <italic>Lpl</italic>, <italic>Ch25h</italic>, and <italic>Apoc1</italic> in CD47 KO mice contrasted markedly withÂ that in Trem2 KO mice, in which the upregulation of these genes seenÂ during demyelination in control mice was markedly suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poliani et al., 2015</xref>). The signaling mechanisms for SIRPÎ± and Trem2 are contrasting. SIRPÎ± activates tyrosine phosphatase Shp1/2, which binds to a phosphorylated ITIM in the cytoplasmic region of SIRPÎ±, whereas Trem2 activates tyrosine kinase Syk, which binds to phosphorylated ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) in the cytoplasmic part of DAP12, a membrane protein thatÂ forms a receptor complex with Trem2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paradowska-Gorycka and Jurkowska, 2013</xref>). SIRPÎ± and Trem2 may reciprocally control microglia phagocytosis through the function of tyrosine phosphatase and kinase, respectively. Further analysis of the interaction between CD47âSIRPÎ± signaling and Trem2âDAP12 signaling may be important inÂ understanding microglial activation and phagocytosis and in identifying new therapeutic strategies to promote tissue repair in the damaged brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

To obtain SIRPÎ± cKO mice, homozygous SIRPÎ±-flox mice harboring the CD11câCre transgeneÂ or Cx3cr1âCreER<sup>T2</sup> targeted gene were crossed with homozygous SIRPÎ±-flox mice, and the resulting SIRPÎ± cKO (SIRPÎ±-flox:Cx3cr1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>,Â SIRPÎ±-flox:CD11c-Cre) mice were analysed.Â Littermates carrying homozygous SIRPÎ±-flox alleles but lacking Cre recombinase were used as controls.Â To induce Cre-dependent recombination, Cx3cr1âCreER<sup>T2</sup> mice were treated with tamoxifen (TAM) (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Ontario, Canada) at 8 wks of age. TAM was dissolved in ethanol and then diluted seven times with corn oil (Wako, Osaka, Japan) to make a 10 mg/ml solution, and 200 Î¼L (2 mg) of this solution was injected subcutaneously once every 48 hr for five consecutive days (aÂ total of 3 times). TAM-treated mice were analysed more than 8 wks after the treatment. All mice were bred and maintained at the Bioresource Center of Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine under specific pathogenâfree conditions. Mice were housed in an air-conditioned room with a 12-h-light, 12-h-dark cycle. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Experimentation Committee of Gunma University (approval no. 18-015).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Primary antibodies and reagents</title><p>Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) to Iba1 were obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan).

Brain, spinal cord, or spleen was dissected and fixed in the fixation buffer overnight at 4Â°C, then transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for cryoprotection, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Fine Technical, Tokyo, Japan), and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections with a thickness of 10 or 20 Î¼m were prepared with a cryostat, mounted on glass slides, air dried, and washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Otherwise, free-floating sections were washed with PBS. All sections were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) blocking solution (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT) and stained overnight at 8Â°C with primary antibodies diluted in primary antibody dilution buffer (PBS supplemented with 2.5% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Peter A Calabresi (Reviewer #2); Anna Molofsky (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examined the role of SIRP Î± (SIRPa) and CD47 signaling in both developmental myelination and remyelination in the mouse CNS, using SIRPa knockout, CD47 knockout and SIRPa microglial conditional knockout (using CX3CR1-CreER mice) to address the cell-type specific role of SIRPa in microglia. Global loss of either SIRPa or CD47, or conditional loss of SIRPa on microglia led to increased microglial numbers, activation, and expression of CD11c on white matter microglia. While baseline myelin properties and G ratio seemed normal in the conditional knockout, the authors report that cuprizone-induced demyelination was worse in the cKO animals. Together, these studies provide new insight into the mechanisms used to regulate the recruitment and activation of microglia following white matter injury.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The global and conditional knockouts phenocopy each other but the authors only show limited data for conditional knockouts in Figure 6 â staining for CD11c+/Iba1+ cells in the fimbria and normal developmental myelination. To more clearly demonstrate that the conditional knockout phenocopies the global knockout they should expand this data to show CD11c+ staining in other brain and spinal cord regions as demonstrated with the global knockout in Figure 1 and 2. It would be nice to see flow data on the CD11c+ population as for conditional knockouts, similar to what was shown in Figure 3 for SIRPa KO.</p><p>2) In Figure 6, g-ratios would be more clearly demonstrated with a typical g-ratio plot instead of histogram.</p><p>3) The authors should examine CD47 expression in wild-type compared to conditional knockouts to determine if CD47 is downregulated without SIRP interaction or if it is upregulated as compensatory response. If there is a reliable antibody, demonstrating this on different cell types such as neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes, that would be ideal, but if not, flow data as shown in Figure 4C would be interesting for determining if there is a change in distribution of CD47+ microglia in absence of SIRPa.</p><p>4) For SIRPa conditional knockout with CD11c-Cre, would the authors elaborate on why they do not see similar phenotype as in CX3Cr1-Cre, which delete in monocytes, macrophages, mast cells and some cDCs? Do CD11c+ microglia down-regulate SIRPa and is that important prior to progression to a more activated state? Do these mice have a phenotype in the setting of demyelinating injury like was shown for the SIRPa CX3CR1 conditional knockouts?</p><p>5) It would be useful to see more data on the quantification of demyelination and gliosis in the cuprizone treated conditional knockouts in Figure 7. Some of the time points involved only two animals, which seems highly underpowered. It was not entirely clear what was being quantified from the images and graphs shown in Figure 7. The authors provide histograms to indicate demyelination and microgliosis but it is unclear according to the methods and figure legends how this data was quantified and what the axes represent. Some of the n values are low- 2 animals for certain genotypes and should be expanded. The MBP staining intensity is unclear with the gray scale images and should be more clearly illustrated with either fluorescent images or black-gold staining. Another method to quantify demyelination and recovery in the cuprizone model is to microdissect callosa and quantify MBP protein on a WB. Quantification of CD11c+ cells at all time-points should also be provided. Olig2 cells counts provide a measure of total oligodendrocytes but does not address whether by influencing the amount of activated microglia if there is any difference in the proportion of mature or immature oligodendrocytes which could be quantified with a mature marker such as CC1 and OPC markers such as PDGFRa. The text stating Olig2 is a marker of oligodendrocyte progenitor and lineage undergoing terminal differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes should be changed since Olig2 is more of a pan-oligodendrocyte marker.</p><p>6) The authors show that CD11c expression in white matter is altered in the SIRPa deficient animals, but so might any number of other markers which they have not examined. It would be helpful if this dataset were expanded to provide a broader overview of the immunological phenotype of these animals.</p><p>7) The statistical method used to analyze cell counts should be further clarified. Student's t-test would not be the appropriate statistical analysis as it assumes equal variance. Welch's t-test would be more appropriate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42025.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examined the role of SIRP Î± (SIRPa) and CD47 signaling in both developmental myelination and remyelination in the mouse CNS, using SIRPa knockout, CD47 knockout and SIRPa microglial conditional knockout (using CX3CR1-CreER mice) to address the cell-type specific role of SIRPa in microglia.

To respond to the reviewersâ comment, we examined the expression of CD47 in microglia prepared from SIRPÎ± KO mice by flow cytometory as in the original Figure 4C for CD47 KO mice (new Figure 4D). As the reviewerspredicted, the expression of CD47 was increased in SIRPÎ±-deficient microglia. These data suggest that lack of CD47-SIRPÎ± signal may result in the upregulated expression of CD47 or stabilization of CD47-SIRPÎ± complex in microglia. In addition, these data also suggest a possible microglia-microglia interaction through CD47-SIRPÎ± signal, or cis-interaction between CD47 and SIRPÎ± on the same microglia. Supporting these hypotheses, we also found that the expression of CD47 was increased in microglia prepared from miroglia-specific SIRPÎ± cKO mice. However, this experiment could not be repeated, because the number of SIRPÎ± cKO mice we maintained was limited. Thus, we prefer to show this data as a preriminary result in the new Supplementary file 4. We showed our additional data in new Figure 4D and new Supplementary file 4 and rewrote the Results and Discussion in the revised manuscript (Results subsection âInduction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in the white matter of CD47-deficient miceâ; Discussion, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For SIRPa conditional knockout with CD11c-Cre, would the authors elaborate on why they do not see similar phenotype as in CX3Cr1-Cre, which delete in monocytes, macrophages, mast cells and some cDCs?</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer commented, the Cx3cr1-CreER<sup>T2</sup> transgene has been reported to induce tamoxifen (TAM)-dependent rearrangement of a floxed gene not only in microglia, but also in peripheral myeloid cells (monocytes and dendritic cells) and tissue macrophages (Kupffer cells). However, the peripheral cells are short-lived and are replaced by their progeny without rearranged gene within a few weeks after administraiton of TAM (Goldmann et al., 2013). In contrast, the rearranged gene is remained stable in microglia more than 10 weeks after TAM administration (Goldmannet al., 2013), because of their long lifespan of around 15 months (FÃ¼ger et al., 2017). As a result, microglia-specific gene targeting is achieved in Cx3cr1-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice several weeks after TAM treatment. Thus, in our experiments, SIRPÎ± cKO mice were analyzed more than 8 weeks after TAM treatment as described in Materials and methods (subsection âAnimalsâ). In contrast, CD11c-Cre mice have been reported to exhibit very low recombination of a floxed gene in microglia with less than 7% (Goldmannet al., 2013). That is consistent with the absence of CD11c expression in the majority of the resident microglia. Thus, genetic ablation of microglial SIRPÎ± has been achieved with Cx3cr1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>, but not with CD11c-Cre. We clarified this point in the revised manuscript (subsection âInduction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in the brain white matter of microglia-specific SIRPÎ±-deficient miceâ, first and last paragraphs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do CD11c+ microglia down-regulate SIRPa and is that important prior to progression to a more activated state?</p></disp-quote><p>A small subset of resident microglia was CD11c-positive but was hardly detected in wild-type mouse brain as shown in Figure 1 and 2. So it is difficult to produce convincing data regarding the expression change of SIRPÎ± in CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia. However, in the CD11c<sup>+</sup> cell-specific SIRPÎ± cKO mice, in which SIRPÎ± was genetically ablated in the resident CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia, we could not detect an increase in the number of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia (new Figure 6âfigure supplement 2), suggesting, at least, that down-regulation of SIRPÎ± in the resident CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia is not prior to the expansion of these microglia. In contrast, conditional knockout of SIRPÎ± in microglia, the majority of which is CD11c-negative, is sufficient to induce CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia, suggesting that loss of SIRPÎ± in CD11c-negative microglia induces the expression of CD11c, an active microglia marker, in these cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do these mice have a phenotype in the setting of demyelinating injury like was shown for the SIRPa CX3CR1 conditional knockouts?</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, Cx3cr1-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice achieve microglia-specific recombination of a floxed gene, while CD11c-Cre mice exhibit very low recombination in microglia. Thus, the brain phenotype of CDl1c-Cre: SIRPÎ± cKO mice is likely to be different from that of Cx3cr1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>: SIRPÎ± cKO mice. Reviewers may want to eliminate the possible contribution of SIRPÎ± knockout in peripheral cells, such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, to the reduced demyelination phenotype in Cx3cr1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>: SIRPÎ± cKO mice. However, as mentioned above, SIRPÎ± cKO mice were analyzed more than 8 weeks after TAM treatment in our experiments (subsection âAnimalsâ), and, at that time, the peripheral cells have already been replaced by their progeny without rearranged gene. To make this point clear, we added new data in the revised manuscript (new Supplementary file 3). These data showed that the immunoreactivity of SIRPÎ± in the SIRPÎ± cKO mouse spleen, where SIRPÎ±<sup>+</sup> cDC and macrophages exist, was once reduced after TAM treatment, but recovered after several weeks, probably because of the short life span and continuous turnover of these cells. In contrast, the rearranged gene has remained stable in microglia, because of their long lifespan (Goldmannet al. 2013). Thus, it is unlikely that genetic ablation of SIRPÎ± in peripheral cells are involved in the phenotype of Cx3cr1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>: SIRPÎ± cKO mice. As mentioned above, we clarified this point in the revised manuscript (subsection âInduction of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia in the brain white matter of microglia-specific SIRPÎ±-deficient miceâ, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be useful to see more data on the quantification of demyelination and gliosis in the cuprizone treated conditional knockouts in Figure 7. Some of the time points involved only two animals, which seems highly underpowered. It was not entirely clear what was being quantified from the images and graphs shown in Figure 7. The authors provide histograms to indicate demyelination and microgliosis but it is unclear according to the methods and figure legends how this data was quantified and what the axes represent. Some of the n values are low- 2 animals for certain genotypes and should be expanded.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewersâ comment, we added data in new Figure 8 in the revised manuscript (Figure 7 in the original manuscript). In the additonal experiments, we fed control and SIRPÎ± cKO mice with cuprizone diet or normal diet for 3 weeks. The treatment protocol was same as described in our original manuscript, while the age of mice used were slightly different from the experiment shown in the original Figure 7. As a result, data from four control and four cKO mice were involved at âbasal condition (without cuprizone)â and at â3 and 5 weeks cuprizone feedingâ in the new Figure 8. Unfortunately, we could not expand the data for the recovery phase of the demyelination, in which mice were allowed to recover from the demyelination for 2 weeks with normal diet after 5 weeks of cuprizone treatment because of the limitated number of SIRPÎ± cKO mice we have maintained. Instead, to improve the reliability of the data, we analyzed independent images from multiple sections. We clarified this point and stated the necessity of further detailed examination of the recovery phase in the Discussion in the revised manuscript (ninth paragraph). If the reviewers strongly recommended to increase the data in the recovery phase, we would like to consider it again, while it will take quite some time to prepare the sample for the analysis.</p><p>According to the reviewersâ comment, we tried to improve the quantification method in the revised manuscript and clarify what we quantified from the images. In the original manuscript, we quantified area size of demyelination and microgliosis in the analyzed image. In the revised manuscript, we quantified ratio (%) of area size of demyelination area, Iba1-positive area, and CD11c-positive area to that of the white matter region in the image data. We explained the details of the quantification in the Materials and methods(subsection âCuprizone model of demyelinationâ) and rewrote the figure legends (new Figure 8). We also showed an example for the quantification of demyelination size in new Supplementary file 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The MBP staining intensity is unclear with the gray scale images and should be more clearly illustrated with either fluorescent images or black-gold staining. Another method to quantify demyelination and recovery in the cuprizone model is to microdissect callosa and quantify MBP protein on a WB.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewersâ comment, we replaced the grey scale images of MBP staining, as well as that of Iba1 and CD11c staining, to color images in the revised manuscript (new Figure 8). Olig2 staining images have been left as grey scale, because we feel that the identfication of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells is easier in the grey scale images than in color images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Quantification of CD11c+ cells at all time-points should also be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewersâ comment, we quantified CD11c staining and show the result in new Figure 8D. In the graph, the ratio (%) of size of CD11c-positive area to that of the white matter region in the image were calculated as described above (subsection âCuprizone model of demyelinationâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Olig2 cells counts provide a measure of total oligodendrocytes but does not address whether by influencing the amount of activated microglia if there is any difference in the proportion of mature or immature oligodendrocytes which could be quantified with a mature marker such as CC1 and OPC markers such as PDGFRa. The text stating Olig2 is a marker of oligodendrocyte progenitor and lineage undergoing terminal differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes should be changed since Olig2 is more of a pan-oligodendrocyte marker.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewersâ comment. In the original manuscript, we described that âOlig2 is a marker of oligodendrocyte progenitor and lineage undergoing terminal differentiation into mature oligodendrocytesâ, because the expression of Olig2 is decreased in the mature oligodendrocytes. However, decreased expression is not equal to the lack of Olig2 in the mature oligodendrocytes. Indeed, Olig2 is expressed in mature oligodendrocytes. According to the reviewersâ comment, we changed our text and clarified that the Olig2 is a pan-oligodendrocyte marker (subsection âAlleviation of cuprizone-induced demyelination in the brain white matter of microglia-specific SIRPÎ±-deficient miceâ, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors show that CD11c expression in white matter is altered in the SIRPa deficient animals, but so might any number of other markers which they have not examined. It would be helpful if this dataset were expanded to provide a broader overview of the immunological phenotype of these animals.</p></disp-quote><p>In our research, we focused on CD11c because the expression of CD11c sharply reflects the activation of microglia in various neurodegenerative diseases, as well as during postnatal development and normal aging. However, as the reviewers mentioned, expression change of immune marker molecules other than CD11c occurred in microglia in SIRPÎ±-deficient mice. In addition to CD11c, we have examined the expression of immune markers, such as CD68, CD14, and Dectin-1, in our mutant mice by flow cytometry (CD14, Dectin-1, CD68) and immunohistochemistry (CD68) (new Figure 1, Figure 3, Figure 6). We have also examined the expression of several cytokines in the brain and spinal cord (new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2). Furthermore, transcriptome analysis of white matter and microglial fraction revealed changes in the expression profile of immune related pathways in CD47 KO mice (new Figure 5). Thus, we believe that these data provide, at least to some extent, a broader overview of the immunological phenotype of our mutant mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The statistical method used to analyze cell counts should be further clarified. Student's t-test would not be the appropriate statistical analysis as it assumes equal variance. Welch's t-test would be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewersâ comment, we reanalyzed all data by the Welchâs t-test throughout the manuscript, and clarified the statistical method used in the Materials and methods (subsection âStatistical analysisâ) and figure legends in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
