alterations and telomere dysfunction is still an extant question. Previously, we showed that eroded telomeres lead to differentiation instability in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) via DNA hypomethylation at pluripotency-factor promoters. Here, we uncovered that telomerase reverse transcriptase null (<italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mESCs exhibit genome-wide alterations in chromatin accessibility and gene expression during differentiation. These changes were accompanied by an increase of H3K27me3 globally, an altered chromatin landscape at the <italic>Pou5f1/Oct4</italic> promoter, and a refractory response to differentiation cues. Inhibition of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), an H3K27 tri-methyltransferase, exacerbated the impairment in differentiation and pluripotency gene repression in <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>mESCs but not wild-type mESCs, whereas inhibition of H3K27me3 demethylation led to a partial rescue of the <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> phenotype. These data reveal a new interdependent relationship between H3K27me3 and telomere integrity in stem cell lineage commitment that may have implications in aging and cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>telomerase reverse transcriptase</kwd><kwd>telomeres</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>367427</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrington</surname><given-names>Lea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>084637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrington</surname><given-names>Lea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000092</institution-id><institution>Ontario Genomics Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OGI-055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arrowsmith</surname><given-names>Cheryl H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell lineage tracing and biochemical analysis of cell fate during murine stem cell differentiation demonstrates a specific cooperativity between perturbations in histone methylation and eroded telomeres that destabilize cell differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular processes crucial for development, tissue regeneration or cancer progression depend on the presence of cells that retain the capacity to commit to multiple lineages, called pluripotent or multipotent cells. Murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are pluripotent and can form all tissues in the body, whereas multipotent cells can form numerous, but not all, tissue types. The capacity of these cells to replenish committed cell lineages deteriorates with age due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu and Rando, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Waterstrat and Van Zant, 2009</xref>). For example, neuronal or melanocyte stem cell numbers significantly decline with age, whereas aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to aberrant lineage specification and defects in cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krauss and de Haan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maslov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Molofsky et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, stem cell aging directly impacts tissue function through perturbations in the stem cell reservoir or the function of their lineage-committed progeny.</p><p>The gradual attrition of chromosome ends, called telomeres, is observed in human cells in culture and in vivo, and is an established hallmark of aging that is often referred to as the ‘telomere clock’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harley et al., 1992</xref>). Telomere erosion occurs in cells that lack sufficient activity of an enzyme called telomerase, whose catalytic core is comprised of a reverse transcriptase (TERT) and an integral RNA component (TR). Without telomerase, an inexorable decline in telomere reserves eventually leads to what is termed telomere uncapping. This uncapping elicits a DNA damage response that results in chromosome loss, rearrangements, and cell death or arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Lange, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lazzerini-Denchi and Sfeir, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Muraki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Takai et al., 2003</xref>). Even in stem cells, the retention of low levels of <italic>TERT</italic> expression cannot fully compensate for the telomere shortening that occurs during DNA replication. For example, although mice retain higher levels of telomerase activity in most adult tissues compared to humans, telomerase activity levels do decrease with age and lead to telomere erosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores et al., 2008</xref>). Mice heterozygous for the genes encoding the telomerase RNA (<italic>Terc</italic>) or telomerase reverse transcriptase (<italic>Tert</italic>) are haploinsufficient for telomere maintenance and, depending on the genetic background, eventually exhibit many of the stem cell defects associated with telomerase knockout strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrington, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Strong et al., 2011</xref>). Similar telomere erosion occurs in human stem cells during aging, despite the persistence of low levels of telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baerlocher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lansdorp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Röth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vaziri et al., 1994</xref>). Although a causal link between short telomeres and human aging is still under investigation, shorter telomeres are associated with many human disorders that include dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, lung fibrosis, and blood cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackburn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Decottignies and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2011</xref>). These disorders are marked by failures in cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lo Sardo et al., 2017</xref>), and by stem cell depletion in the blood and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertuch, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Post-translational modifications added to DNA and histones that are inherited over cell divisions, known as epigenetic modifications, are tightly regulated in stem cells and play a crucial role in regulating cell fate. Many epigenetic alterations occur with age and are considered hallmarks of the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Booth and Brunet, 2016</xref>). For example, DNA methylation patterns are altered during aging, whereby the genome becomes largely hypomethylated with hypermethylation at some loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krauss and de Haan, 2016</xref>). One contributing mechanism may be the downregulation of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) activity with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the finding that DNA hypomethylation does not affect stem cell self-renewal capacity nor the expression of pluripotency genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beerman and Rossi, 2015</xref>), <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> knock-out mice exhibit an increase in HSC self-renewal and a predisposition to hematopoietic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>). Changes in the abundance of other epigenetic modifications, such as decreased tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is associated with and may help drive the onset of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shah et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, an increase of H3K27me3 in HSCs and muscle stem cells observed in aged mice is suggested to restrict stem cell potential via a differentiation bias of older stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunet and Rando, 2017</xref>). Given the role of epigenetics in stem cell differentiation and consequently in tissue maintenance, these and other findings have led to the notion that epigenetic alterations represent another age-associated clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung and Pfeifer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wilson and Jones, 1983</xref>). These age-associated changes in DNA methylation patterns may intersect a broad array of health-related issues, ranging from Alzheimer’s disease to circadian rhythm disruption to lactose intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Labrie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Oh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Oh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A major question that remains unresolved is the role of histone methylation in the epigenetic regulation of cell fate in cells with dysfunctional telomeres. In mice, loss of telomere integrity affects chromatin throughout the telomeric and sub-telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benetti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benetti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gonzalo et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, roles distal to the telomere have been described for the telomere shelterin subunit, Rap1, in mice and in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marión et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Platt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Song and Johnson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vaquero-Sedas and Vega-Palas, 2019</xref>). There are other consequences for cell fate beyond senescence, as telomere dysfunction is known to impair stem cell differentiation in numerous contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrington and Pucci, 2018</xref>). For example, eroded telomeres in mESCs impair their ability to fully consolidate a differentiated phenotype in response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pucci et al., 2013</xref>). Repression of the pluripotency-promoting factors <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (also known as <italic>Oct4</italic>) is impaired in late passage cells with critically short telomeres upon differentiation, compared to wild-type (WT) or earlier passage telomerase-deficient <italic>(Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mESCs with longer telomeres. This impairment is associated with a reduction in DNA methylation at the <italic>Nanog</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pucci et al., 2013</xref>). The impaired repression of pluripotency genes in mESCs with dysfunctional telomeres is reversible, and telomere rescue via <italic>Tert</italic> reintroduction, or ectopic expression of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, elicits a partial reversal of this differentiation defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pucci et al., 2013</xref>). Although the ability of critically eroded telomeres to induce these changes is unexpected, the consequences of these epigenetic alterations upon cell fate commitment was already well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kraushaar and Zhao, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nativio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reddington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smith et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Since the repression of <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Pou5f1</italic> during differentiation rely upon H3K27me3 deposition via the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Obier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Villasante et al., 2011</xref>), and Dnmt3 and PRC2 are critical to mESC neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), we investigated whether perturbation of H3K27me3 levels, genome-wide, could further impact the cell differentiation defect associated with dysfunctional telomeres. We found a striking ability of chemical modulators of histone H3K27 methylation to specifically affect the fate of mESCs with short telomeres, with little effect on WT mESCs. We suggest that telomere status and histone methylation may be more linked than previously appreciated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Murine ESCs with critically short telomeres fail to consolidate a differentiated state</title><p>To address the role of telomere shortening on stem cell differentiation, we analyzed late-passage (passage 40 or greater) <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs that possess significantly shorter telomeres and an increase in end-to-end fusions compared to WT mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2000</xref>). Despite this telomere instability, and consistent with our previously reported results, there was no observable difference in population doubling time between the lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pucci et al., 2013</xref>) (data not shown). In WT and <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs, we assessed stem cell differentiation by the withdrawal of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and the induction of cell differentiation with 5 μM all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 6 days (6 DA; blue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The stability of the differentiated state, that is a refractory response to LIF re-addition, was also evaluated upon a further 6 days in LIF-containing media that lacked ATRA (6 DA + 6 DL; orange) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both mESC lines contained a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter placed under the transcriptional control of the pluripotency gene regulator <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, which enabled their sorting into distinct pluripotent (GFP+) or lineage-committed (GFP-) sub-populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected after induction of differentiation (6 DA), WT mESCs went from a GFP+ state (green) to a GFP- state (blue) and remained so even after LIF re-addition (orange) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs failed to fully repress the GFP reporter when treated with ATRA, and this defect became more pronounced after re-addition of LIF-containing media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The failure of <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs to repress <italic>Pou5f1</italic> -GFP during differentiation was also reflected in higher endogenous levels of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> and <italic>Nanog mRNA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). GFP cell-sorting and further analysis of other pluripotency markers showed that GFP+ sorted sub-populations of <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs retained a higher level of pluripotency gene expression after ATRA (SA), or LIF re-addition (SL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

For example, although these inhibitor dosages had no impact on WT mESC differentiation capacity, we did not transcriptionally profile WT ESCs treated with compounds. Furthermore, although overall perturbations in the chromatin landscape were evident in <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs, further ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq analysis would be needed to quantify the impact of PRC2 or Kdm6a/b inhibition on the chromatin accessibility or the density of H3K27m3 enrichment at specific pluripotency gene promoters or other loci. Despite these important considerations, there was a marked defect in pluripotency marker repression and differentiation commitment that was specific to <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs upon PRC2 or Kdm6a/b inhibition, both chemically and genetically, and these defects were mirrored by overall alterations in transcription and chromatin accessibility, some of which may reflect this aberrant cell fate commitment.</p><p>Given their known roles in the establishment of the heterochromatin state and in agreement with previous studies from other groups, our data also suggest a complex interplay between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation. A study by Hagarman et al. showed that the absence of all three <italic>Dnmt</italic> genes resulted in an increase in the level of H3K27me3 in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hagarman et al., 2013</xref>). This data led to the emergence of two different hypotheses regarding the crosstalk between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation. In one hypothesis, DNA methylation may antagonize H3K27me3 through the exclusion of the PRC2 components from methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hagarman et al., 2013</xref>). In the alternative model, unmethylated CpG can recruit the PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wachter et al., 2014</xref>) which is known to interact with Dnmts, thereby positively regulating DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Viré et al., 2006</xref>). We have yet to ascertain if the increase in global H3K27me3 levels observed in <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESC extracts reflects a significant increase in H3K27me3 recruitment to the promoters of specific loci, however it is interesting to speculate it could be a compensatory mechanism to offset the suboptimal DNA methylation levels when Dnmt levels are limiting. Despite this accumulation of H3K27me3, it is insufficient to overcome the differentiation defect of <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs, and inhibition of H3K27 methylation led to a further impairment of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In humans, Yu and colleagues suggested a feedback loop between <italic>TERT</italic> and <italic>DNMT3B</italic> transcription. They found that <italic>TERT</italic> depletion in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC) resulted in reduced <italic>DNMT3B</italic> transcription, and they proposed that TERT itself may cooperate with the transcription factor Sp1 to promote <italic>DNMT3B</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). This complex interplay between DNA and histone methylation, and how it is affected in <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs, will be an interesting topic for future investigation.</p><p>More generally, this study also examined the impact of PRC2 and Kdm6a/b inhibition on the chromatin accessibility landscape in mESCs after differentiation. To our surprise, the impact of these inhibitors on chromatin accessibility was relatively modest over the 14 days during which WT mESCs were exposed to ATRA followed by LIF. In WT mESCs, this relative resistance to epigenetic perturbation may, in part, be reflected by the relatively low inhibitor concentration and the duration of exposure. Similarly, inhibitor treatment of differentiated <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs re-exposed to LIF did not dramatically alter the overall chromatin accessibility landscape, perhaps because the landscape was already significantly altered toward a more pluripotent-like state. This result differs from mESCs completely lacking functional PRC2, in which the ability of differentiated somatic cells to be reprogrammed was dramatically impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pereira et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the response to PRC2 inhibition is likely dosage-dependent, and under the conditions we tested, inhibition of PRC2 did not significantly impede the differentiation potential of WT mESCs.</p><p>Unlike normal cells, the cancer epigenome is exceptionally plastic, particularly within non-coding regions, and is particularly so upon PRC2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fioravanti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dawson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stricker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). PRC2 inhibition also has dramatic consequences for early murine development and cell differentiation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khan et al., 2015</xref>), although the impact on gene expression in adults is more restricted to bivalently controlled, tissue-restricted transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jadhav et al., 2016</xref>). In this regard, differentiated <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs could also be considered more plastic, as they demonstrated a strong propensity to re-express pluripotent genes even in the absence of PRC2 inhibitors, and re-acquired a chromatin landscape reminiscent of pluripotent mESCs. Furthermore, this property does not appear to be specific to retinoic acid-induced ESC differentiation. In a recent study, <italic>Terc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (telomerase RNA knockout) ESCs with short telomeres exhibited a disruption in PRC2/H3K27me3-mediated repression of Follistatin, <italic>Fsp</italic>, that led to impaired epidermal stem cell specification and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). These results underscore that telomere erosion impairs the epigenetic regulation of cell fate specification in multiple contexts.</p><p>Further investigation will ascertain exactly how critically short telomeres elicit these genome-wide perturbations, and whether the epigenetic alterations mirror the altered patterns in methylated DNA observed in older humans or in cancer cells with short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>). Since many cancer cell types and aged tissues possess shorter telomeres, it is possible that the plasticity of these epigenetic modifications may, in part, be affected by telomere integrity. If so, stress responses that promote cellular reprogramming might be linked to eroded telomeres. For example, Mosteiro and colleagues found that senescence promoted in vivo programming of murine iPSCs, although the relevance of telomere integrity in this process was not directly assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mosteiro et al., 2018</xref>). In cardiomyocytes stimulated to undergo iPSC reprogramming, there was an inverse correlation between reprogramming potential and telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguado et al., 2017</xref>).

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The work reported in this manuscript elaborates details of an intriguing interplay between replicative aging, differentiation and epigenetic histone methylation marks. Critically short telomeres interfere with cell differentiation maintenance mechanisms and the thorough work reported here shows that enzymes that affect histone methylation states are critical contributing factors for these changes. Future work must reveal the mechanistic relation between short telomeres and these genome wide epigenetic markers. Such insights potentially provide exciting new avenues towards an understanding of the differentiation status of cancer cells and, as corollary, of cells in short telomere-induced senescence.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Telomere dysfunction cooperates with epigenetic alterations to impair murine embryonic stem cell fate commitment&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Eisen as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jan Karlseder (Reviewer #1); Alexandra Belayew (Reviewer #2); Benoit Laurent (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers very much appreciated that you address an important aspect of differentiation stability in embryonic stem cells. The experiments were deemed well thought out and executed and the conclusions therefore, for the most part, very solid and exciting. However, the reviewers also thought that certain results need to be better supported by adding some critical experiments. Upon discussing the manuscript, all reviewers eventually agreed that the following three experiments would be essential in order for the manuscript to go forward:</p><p>1) Previously, you used ChIP to report promoter specific changes in H3K27me3 in cell differentiation assays. In the manuscript here, there is a heavy reliance on inhibitors of enzymes that are thought to change the level of this modification genome wide. While a general appraisal of the levels of H3K27me3 in the various conditions is reported by Westerns, it would be important to show the specificity of those changes by evaluating the changes via ChIP-seq on H3K27me3. Such changes could then be related other genome wide analyses of chromatin states (see the ATAC-seq). This experiment, performed on a select choice of conditions, therefore is crucial to bolster the specificity of the effects of enzyme inhibition.</p><p>2) The biochemical activities of the PRC2 and JmJD3 enzymes was interfered with using chemical inhibitors. While the reviewers appreciated the use of similar but inactive compounds as controls, they thought that an independent way of inhibition (shRNA mediated knock-down targeting PCR2 core subunits and Jmjd3/KDM6B) would considerably strengthen the robustness of these conclusions.</p><p>3) Assuming all the above confirm and strengthen the conclusions, at the end of the day, we still do not know whether the described effect is a telomere-specific effect (due to short telomeres, telomere BFB cycles or telomere damage induced signalling), or is an effect induced by general DNA damage signalling. This differentiation of the source of the signal is extremely important for building a molecular hypothesis and going forward. Therefore, the issue should be settled such that the discussion is relevant to the findings. This could be achieved by exposing wt MEFs to bleomycin or gamma-irradiation to yield a damage signaling similar to the one in the mTERT<italic><sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs and a few days later, performing a differentiation assay as reported in the paper.</p><p>As mentioned above, inclusion and adequate discussion of these experiments is deemed essential for a resubmission and we are looking forward to that.</p><p>However, below I also include the other observations/points raised by the reviewers. While it is not essential to address them experimentally, I thought they may be useful when revising the manuscript as certain points could be addressed verbally.</p><p>– Could an additional point be addressed in the discussion? The epigenetic age determination methods proposed by Horvath's group and based on changes in methylation of different sets of CpGs has been mentioned in several publications not to be linked to telomere length. Maybe the authors could perform an additional computer analysis of their data to identify where such &quot;epigenetic clock&quot; CpGs are mapped in the chromatin structure landscape, in/out H3K27me3 binding regions? Based on the authors' comment in paragraph two of the Discussion, are these outside of pluripotency genes? Maybe selecting a CpG subgroup with homogeneous location in open chromatin could be more related to telomere length? Or would the authors agree this lack of association could be caused by a telomerase function unrelated to telomere maintenance as suggested in Horvath's publication Lu et al. Nature Communications 2018?</p><p>– The authors could address the impact of telomere length versus telomere function. At this time it is unclear, whether the short telomeres, the fused telomeres, the breakage of the fusions, or the deprotected telomeres impact differentiation. This can be addressed by deprotecting long telomeres via TRF2 inhibition, by examining ESC with short telomeres that do not fuse yet, by inhibiting the NHEJ machinery to prevent fusion of critically short telomeres and by inhibiting the signaling from short telomeres via ATM activation.</p><p>– Indirect effects of PRC2 and Jmjd6 inhibition will be plentiful, as revealed by the changes in transcription pattern. While I appreciate that it will be very difficult to distinguish between effects directly on telomeres and indirect effects, this should be discussed in more detail.</p><p>– ATAC-seq were performed on WT and <italic>mTERT<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs with PRC2 and Jmjd3/KDM6B inhibitors but in Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1F and Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, the controls on the WT mESCs are missing. The authors should include these controls and modify their conclusions accordingly. Moreover, several data annotated as not shown should be included in the manuscript (see specific comments).</p><p>– The authors did an effort of consistency for the annotation of their conditions (6DA, 6DA+6DL) however the PCA figures presented in the main figures are hard to read (not to say illegible) due to the important number of information (especially Figure 1E). The authors should put this type of figures in the supplemental figures and favor the inclusion of the qPCR array heatmap in the main figures. In addition, the clustering the qPCR array data makes difficult to correctly interpret and conclude on the results.</p><p>– The differentiation impairment and transcriptional differences are not correlated to the global alteration of chromatin landscape (see specific comment Figure 4A). How the authors reconcile the high global H3K27me3 level observed in <italic>mTert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs and the effects of inhibitors (Figure 2B and Figure 3B) with the absence of variation for chromatin accessibility upon inhibitor treatment (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1)? This discrepancy should be addressed by performing H3K27me3 ChIP in presence or absence of PRC2 and Jmjd3/KDM6B inhibitors.</p><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 1A : Is there a difference in telomere length between GFP- and GFP+ cells after 6DA or 6DA + 6DL treatment that could explain the difference of commitment? Also, if the authors are able to recover WT GFP+ cells after 6DA or 6DA + 6DL treatment, it will be great to show telomere dysfunction for this population to strongly support their hypothesis.</p><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 1D :</p><p>• The top clustering is very confusing and make the results harder to interpret. The authors should reorganize the heatmap by cell type (e.g. WT mESCs in lane 2, 3, 8 together clearly show that ATRA induces a specific expression pattern that is maintained after re-exposure to LIF) and modify their conclusions accordingly. For example, based on the Figure 1E, the authors mentioned that &quot;the GFP+ subpopulations of mTERT<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mESCs sorted after 6DA or 6DA + 6DL treatment more closely resembled undifferentiated WT mESCs&quot;. However, it does not appear to be the case on the qPCR array heatmap (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D lane 10 +11 vs lane 2).</p><p>• The GFP- subpopulation of mTERT<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs sorted after 6DA or 6DA + 6DL treatment (lane 9 + 4) are also able to differentiate and consolidate this differentiation compared to the GFP+ subpopulation (lane 10 + 11). Based on the Figure 1B, 80% of mTert<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs are GFP- after treatment and therefore able to go to commit towards differentiation – even the expression pattern looks slightly different from the WT (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D lane 4 vs lane 8). What could influence mTert<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs to commit towards the GFP- more than the GFP+ subpopulation? The authors should at least discuss this point and potentially perform experiments e.g. differences in telomere length or global H3K27me3 level between these subpopulations.</p><p>• Based on the clustering, the authors claim that transcriptional profiles did not differ markedly between undifferentiated WT and mTert<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs (subsection “Compromised telomere integrity alters gene expression profiles”). However by looking more closely, it appears than around 30% of the tested genes show differential expression at basal level (e.g. gene Hand1 to gene Rcvm, gene cd79a to gene Gbx2). The authors should clarify this point and modify their conclusions accordingly.</p><p>– Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B : Additional control western blots are required. The authors should include additional histone marks as negative control (e.g. H3K4me1) and as potential crosstalk marks (e.g. H3K27Ac). In addition, the authors should address the PRC2 protein level in WT and mTert<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs.</p><p>– Subsection “Inhibition of PRC2 specifically impairs differentiation in mESCs with</p><p>dysfunctional telomeres” : The authors should check the expression of pluripotency markers in WT and mTert<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs in the LIF media and under the optimized concentration of PRC2 inhibitors.</p><p>– In the same section: The authors should include in the manuscript these data referenced as data not shown. How do the authors explain this result? This observation implies that the expression and/or activity of PRC2 is more important after 6DA + 6DL treatment. What is the protein expression level of PRC2 in ESCs maintained in LIF or treated with 6DA compared to ESCs treated with 6DA+6DL?</p><p>– Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1F the authors should include WT cells treated with PRC2 inhibitors.</p><p>– Figure 2E : Why the expression of Nanog by the mTert<sup>-/-</sup> cells in DMSO conditions are so different between the two western blots while the expression of Hsp90ab1 seems similar? The authors should load all the samples on the same gel to favor a better quantification and comparison between each condition.</p><p>– Figure 2—figure supplement 1F: Based on their clustering (Figure 2F), the authors claim that PRC2 inhibitors led to an alteration in the overall gene expression profiles compared with the inactive analogues (subsection “Inhibition of PRC2 specifically impairs differentiation in mESCs with dysfunctional telomeres”). I partially disagree on this statement. We do not see any major differences for GSK343 and UNC1999 vs UNC2400 (left panel Figure 2—figure supplement 1F) while Eed inhibition by A395 vs A395N seems to be more convincing on that aspect. Experiments using shRNA should be performed to clarify the results.</p><p>– Figure 3B : Additional control western blots are needed. The authors should include additional histone marks as negative control (e.g. H3K4me1) and as potential crosstalk marks (e.g. H3K27Ac). We do not see any effect of GSKJ5 on H3K27me3 for the WT cells vs mTert<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs. The authors should address the protein expression level of Jmjd3/KDM6B in WT and mTert<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs maintained in LIF, treated with 6DA or 6DA+6DL to make sure that Jmjd3/KDM6B protein levels are comparable.</p><p>– Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 1E the authors should include WT cells treated with Jmjd3/KDM6B inhibitors.</p><p>– Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1: I agree with the authors on this statement &quot;mTert<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs failed to consolidate a differentiated phenotype&quot;, however chemical inhibition (PRC2 or Jmjd3/KDM6B inhibitors) with active or inactive compounds globally does not affect the chromatin accessible landscape for the WT and mTert<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs. This observation suggests that the global alteration of chromatin landscape does not correlate with the differentiation impairment and transcriptional differences previously described. Example 1: in Figure 2E, Nanog expression is strongly affected by UNC2400 treatment in mTert<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs when compared to UNC1900 treatment but in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, there is no difference in chromatin accessibility. Example 2: in Figure 3C, Pou5f1/oct4 decreases after GSKJ4 treatment in mTert<sup>-/-</sup> mESCs compared to the DMSO or GSKJ5 condition but in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, there is no difference in chromatin accessibility. The authors should comment on these points and modify their conclusions accordingly. In addition, the authors should perform H3K27me3 ChIP in presence or absence of PRC2 and Jmjd3/KDM6B inhibitors to clarify the interplay between H3K27me3 and stem cell lineage commitment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47333.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three reviewers very much appreciated that you address an important aspect of differentiation stability in embryonic stem cells.

First, we show a western blot of an H3K27me3-deficient AML line to demonstrate specificity of the H3K27me3 antibody we used for the ChIP-seq experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, panel A). For the ChIP-seq, rather than quantify peak heights (which would require numerous replicates and only enable comparison of a limited number of samples), we chose to analyze a large cohort of samples and conduct Spearman correlation analysis, as we did for ATAC-seq. We observed the predicted changes in ChIP-seq patterns across the genome in <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs compared with WT mESCs. Inspection of specific loci (e.g., <italic>Pou5f1</italic> revealed differences between controls (DMSO) compared with the active PRC2 inhibitors (UNC1999, GSK343). These results support the specificity of the compounds, as the reviewer requested, and the data are discussed in the text, paragraph three of subsection “Telomere dysfunction remodels the chromatin accessibility landscape of differentiated cells toward a pluripotent-like state”. The ChIP-seq data is shown in Figure 4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and the raw data in Figure 4—source data 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The biochemical activities of the PRC2 and JmJD3 enzymes was interfered with using chemical inhibitors. While the reviewers appreciated the use of similar but inactive compounds as controls, they thought that an independent way of inhibition (shRNA mediated knock-down targeting PCR2 core subunits and Jmjd3/KDM6B) would considerably strengthen the robustness of these conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the requested genetic validation experiments. As discussed in the revised manuscript (paragraph two of subsection “Inhibition of the H3K27me3 erasers Kdm6a/b partially rescues the differentiation impairment of <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs.”), we chose to use CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts rather than shRNA knockdown. We found that non-clonal populations containing <italic>Ezh2</italic> knockout cells led to a further exacerbation of the differentiation defect in <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs, whereas <italic>Kdm6b</italic> knockout populations led to a partial rescue of the differentiation defect. These genetic results are consistent with the results we obtained with chemical inhibitors of Ezh2 and Kdm6b. This new data is included in Figure 3—figure supplement 1I-L and the corresponding Source data file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Assuming all the above confirm and strengthen the conclusions, at the end of the day, we still do not know whether the described effect is a telomere-specific effect (due to short telomeres, telomere BFB cycles or telomere damage induced signalling), or is an effect induced by general DNA damage signalling.

Therefore, the issue should be settled such that the discussion is relevant to the findings.

We tested the effect of DNA damage on the differentiation response of WT mESCs and as further control <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-H). Gamma-irradiation did not affect the WT mESCs, either under pluripotent growth conditions (LIF) or after differentiation. This result argues against a general effect of DNA damage on differentiation commitment under these conditions. In contrast, <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs, although slightly less radio-sensitive than WT mESCs, exhibited a further defect in differentiation commitment. These results are interesting and suggest that DNA damage may enhance the impact of a critically eroded telomere, but that the effect is not merely attributable to DNA damage <italic>per se</italic>. They are discussed in the text, paragraph two of subsection “Murine ESCs with critically short telomeres fail to consolidate a differentiated state”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As mentioned above, inclusion and adequate discussion of these experiments is deemed essential for a resubmission and we are looking forward to that.</p><p>However, below I also include the other observations/points raised by the reviewers.

Nature Communications 2018?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer poses a fascinating question. There are a few points to consider. First, the Horvath clock is based on 353 specific CpGs within the human genome called the CpG clock. These CpGs are located within genomic regions whose expression is regulated during development and differentiation, and some of these regions are regulated by PRC2. Among these sites, some CpGs correlate negatively with chronological aging and others correlate positively. However, the status of any one CpG doesn’t necessarily reflect chronological aging. Performing such a comparison, in our case, would therefore be challenging because it would be difficult to directly map changes in the chromatin landscape between mice and humans. We don’t yet have genome-wide methylome data for <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs, and we don’t yet know what the “CpG clock” is in mice with short telomeres (there is a multi-tissue DNA methylation age predictor but only in a wild-type- genetic background with long telomeres, &gt;90 kbp; see Stubbs et al., Genome Biology 2017). Thus, we feel at this juncture it is not possible to address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors could address the impact of telomere length versus telomere function. At this time it is unclear, whether the short telomeres, the fused telomeres, the breakage of the fusions, or the deprotected telomeres impact differentiation. This can be addressed by deprotecting long telomeres via TRF2 inhibition, by examining ESC with short telomeres that do not fuse yet, by inhibiting the NHEJ machinery to prevent fusion of critically short telomeres and by inhibiting the signaling from short telomeres via ATM activation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another interesting question. We previously showed that re-introduction of <italic>Tert</italic> into late passage <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs ameliorated the differentiation defect after only 4 passages, which partially rescued critically eroded ends but didn’t significantly elongate telomeres, and that early passage <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs with long telomeres do not exhibit a differentiation defect (Pucci et al., 2013). While these data argue that critically short telomeres destabilize differentiation, we have yet to explore the experiments suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Indirect effects of PRC2 and Jmjd6 inhibition will be plentiful, as revealed by the changes in transcription pattern. While I appreciate that it will be very difficult to distinguish between effects directly on telomeres and indirect effects, this should be discussed in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and we now discuss these limitations, Discussion paragraph two.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– ATAC-seq were performed on WT and mTERT-/- mESCs with PRC2 and Jmjd3/KDM6B inhibitors but in Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1F and Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, the controls on the WT mESCs are missing. The authors should include these controls and modify their conclusions accordingly. Moreover, several data annotated as not shown should be included in the manuscript (see specific comments).</p></disp-quote><p>In our initial characterization of the inhibitors we tested both WT and <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs for their differentiation response, and found no alterations in differentiation commitment. We had shown the data for the 6DA + 6DL samples for WT and <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs (Figure 2 B; Figure 3 B) and we now include the data for 2DL and 6DA (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). Based on this result, we included two controls (WT and <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs, 2DL) alongside all the <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs (DMSO controls plus inhibitors). It is also likely, as the reviewer points out, that there are alterations in the transcriptional profile of WT mESCs treated with compounds, and we now mention this point in the text (Discussion paragraph two). In the future, we plan to use RNA-seq to address this question in further detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors did an effort of consistency for the annotation of their conditions (6DA, 6DA+6DL) however the PCA figures presented in the main figures are hard to read (not to say illegible) due to the important number of information (especially Figure 1E). The authors should put this type of figures in the supplemental figures and favor the inclusion of the qPCR array heatmap in the main figures. In addition, the clustering the qPCR array data makes difficult to correctly interpret and conclude on the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have switched the figure panels as suggested by the reviewer and attempted to clarify the presentation of results, please see subsection “Compromised telomere integrity alters gene expression profiles”, and the summary of Figure changes, attached. We did not adjust the order of the samples in the heatmap in order not to interfere with the information provided via Euclidean clustering.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The differentiation impairment and transcriptional differences are not correlated to the global alteration of chromatin landscape (see specific comment Figure 4A). How the authors reconcile the high global H3K27me3 level observed in mTert-/- mESCs and the effects of inhibitors (Figure 2B and Figure 3B) with the absence of variation for chromatin accessibility upon inhibitor treatment (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1)? This discrepancy should be addressed by performing H3K27me3 ChIP in presence or absence of PRC2 and Jmjd3/KDM6B inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good point. We speculate that, since the chromatin is so widely accessible in differentiated <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs to begin with, that it might be difficult to quantify additional increases or decreases with the inhibitors, despite the fact they clearly affect pluripotency gene expression. As described above, the ChIP-seq analysis revealed additional H3K27me3 peaks at the promoter of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic> in <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs, in addition to the global increase in H3K27me3 we originally reported. However, this enhancement in H3K27me3 was insufficient to repress <italic>Pou5f1</italic> expression, as shown by our transcriptional and ATAC-seq analysis. This result is in keeping with other studies that we cite in the text that is in the absence of sufficient DNA methylation, there is a compensatory increase in H3K27me3. In the case of <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs this recruitment is insufficient to restore differentiation stability. We believe the ChIP-seq data may provide some insight into why <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs are sensitive to PRC2 inhibitors (paragraph three of subsection “Telomere dysfunction remodels the chromatin accessibility landscape of differentiated cells toward a pluripotent-like state”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 1A : Is there a difference in telomere length between GFP- and GFP+ cells after 6DA or 6DA + 6DL treatment that could explain the difference of commitment? Also, if the authors are able to recover WT GFP+ cells after 6DA or 6DA + 6DL treatment, it will be great to show telomere dysfunction for this population to strongly support their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We are interested in this question as well. However, we have been hampered in these efforts by the few GFP+ cells we can recover from differentiated WT mESCs which we would need as a control, and the difficulty overall in obtaining enough viable cells after FACS sorting for re-culturing and q-FISH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 1D :</p><p>• The top clustering is very confusing and make the results harder to interpret. The authors should reorganize the heatmap by cell type (e.g. WT mESCs in lane 2, 3, 8 together clearly show that ATRA induces a specific expression pattern that is maintained after re-exposure to LIF) and modify their conclusions accordingly. For example, based on the Figure 1E, the authors mentioned that &quot;the GFP+ subpopulations of mTERT-/- mESCs sorted after 6DA or 6DA + 6DL treatment more closely resembled undifferentiated WT mESCs&quot;. However, it does not appear to be the case on the qPCR array heatmap (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D lane 10 +11 vs lane 2).</p></disp-quote><p>The top labels indicate the Euclidean distance between samples and if we rearranged the order we would lose critical information on the relatedness between samples. We agree that this section needed clarification, and we have attempted to do so in subsection “Compromised telomere integrity alters gene expression profiles”. We also acknowledge that it is merely the relatedness by Euclidean clustering by which we meant “more closely resembled” and that there is indeed a high degree of heterogeneity between the transcriptional profiles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The GFP- subpopulation of mTERT-/- mESCs sorted after 6DA or 6DA + 6DL treatment (lane 9 + 4) are also able to differentiate and consolidate this differentiation compared to the GFP+ subpopulation (lane 10 + 11). Based on the Figure 1B, 80% of mTert-/- mESCs are GFP- after treatment and therefore able to go to commit towards differentiation – even the expression pattern looks slightly different from the WT (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D lane 4 vs lane 8). What could influence mTert-/- mESCs to commit towards the GFP- more than the GFP+ subpopulation? The authors should at least discuss this point and potentially perform experiments e.g. differences in telomere length or global H3K27me3 level between these subpopulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to state that GFP- <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ESCS and WT ESCS are not equivalent, and that we think this difference underscores the aberrant nature of the differentiation program in the presence of short telomeres (subsection “Compromised telomere integrity alters gene expression profiles”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Based on the clustering, the authors claim that transcriptional profiles did not differ markedly between undifferentiated WT and mTert-/- mESCs (subsection “Compromised telomere integrity alters gene expression profiles”). However by looking more closely, it appears than around 30% of the tested genes show differential expression at basal level (e.g. gene Hand1 to gene Rcvm, gene cd79a to gene Gbx2). The authors should clarify this point and modify their conclusions accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We based our conclusion on the profile clustering, but agree there is still heterogeneity in the transcriptional profiles. We have now clarified this issue in the revised text (subsection “Compromised telomere integrity alters gene expression profiles”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B : Additional control western blots are required.

In addition, the authors should address the PRC2 protein level in WT and mTert-/- mESCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously examined H3K4me3 methylation at the promoters of <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (Pucci et al., 2013) and found no significant difference.

However, in the top panel in Figure 2 C a shorter exposure time is shown because GSK343 treatment results in a larger increase in Nanog than A395 treatment (i.e. at the same exposure, we would exceed the linear range of the Nanog signal in GSK343). The quantification of the results is shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2—figure supplement 1F : Based on their clustering (Figure 2F), the authors claim that PRC2 inhibitors led to an alteration in the overall gene expression profiles compared with the inactive analogues (subsection “Inhibition of PRC2 specifically impairs differentiation in mESCs with dysfunctional telomeres”). I partially disagree on this statement. We do not see any major differences for GSK343 and UNC1999 vs UNC2400 (left panel Figure 2—figure supplement 1F) while Eed inhibition by A395 vs A395N seems to be more convincing on that aspect. Experiments using shRNA should be performed to clarify the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with the reviewer that the effects of the inhibitors on gene expression profiles is subtle, despite the fact there are clear differences in differentiation commitment that are specific to the active inhibitors. It should also be noted that some of the inactive controls (e.g. UNC2400) are known to retain some residual activity against PRC2. To test these findings genetically, we now include CRISPR-mediated knockout experiments (paragraph two of subsection “Inhibition of the H3K27me3 erasers Kdm6a/b partially rescues the differentiation impairment of <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3B : Additional control western blots are needed.

We do not see any effect of GSKJ5 on H3K27me3 for the WT cells vs mTert-/- mESCs. The authors should address the protein expression level of Jmjd3/KDM6B in WT and mTert-/- mESCs maintained in LIF, treated with 6DA or 6DA+6DL to make sure that Jmjd3/KDM6B protein levels are comparable.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we plan to address this potential crosstalk using genome-wide ChIP-seq approaches but believe this exceeds the scope of the present study.

We also show H3K37me3 levels in cells in which we disrupted <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in a heterogeneous, non-clonal knockout population (Figure 3—figure supplement 1I-L) and noted a modest (but not statistically significant) increase in H3K27me3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 1E the authors should include WT cells treated with Jmjd3/KDM6B inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include the results of the differentiation assay as noted above (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E), but we have not performed transcriptional analysis using the Qiagen qPCR array.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1: I agree with the authors on this statement &quot;mTert-/- mESCs failed to consolidate a differentiated phenotype&quot;, however chemical inhibition (PRC2 or Jmjd3/KDM6B inhibitors) with active or inactive compounds globally does not affect the chromatin accessible landscape for the WT and mTert-/- mESCs. This observation suggests that the global alteration of chromatin landscape does not correlate with the differentiation impairment and transcriptional differences previously described. Example 1: in Figure 2E, Nanog expression is strongly affected by UNC2400 treatment in mTert-/- mESCs when compared to UNC1900 treatment but in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, there is no difference in chromatin accessibility. Example 2: in Figure 3C, Pou5f1/oct4 decreases after GSKJ4 treatment in mTert-/- mESCs compared to the DMSO or GSKJ5 condition but in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, there is no difference in chromatin accessibility. The authors should comment on these points and modify their conclusions accordingly. In addition, the authors should perform H3K27me3 ChIP in presence or absence of PRC2 and Jmjd3/KDM6B inhibitors to clarify the interplay between H3K27me3 and stem cell lineage commitment.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed ATAC-seq on 72 samples. Although further replicates may have allowed quantification of peak heights we do not believe this would alter our conclusions. We agree that the effects with compounds GSKJ4 and GSKJ5 were modest, but emphasize that we chose relatively low concentrations of these inhibitors purposefully, i.e. to enhance any potential differences in differentiation between WT and <italic>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mESCs. The new results we obtained via CRISPR-mediated disruption of <italic>Ezh2</italic> and <italic>Kdm6b</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 1I-L) corroborate our conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
