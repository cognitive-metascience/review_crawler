analyzed RNA-seq data from 23 F1 tissues from different developmental stages, including 19 female tissues allowing X chromosome inactivation (XCI) escapers to also be detected. We demonstrate that allelic expression arising from genetic or epigenetic differences is highly tissue-specific. We find that tissue-specific strain-biased gene expression may be regulated by tissue-specific enhancers or by post-transcriptional differences in stability between the alleles. We also find that escape from X-inactivation is tissue-specific, with leg muscle showing an unexpectedly high rate of XCI escapers. By surveying a range of tissues during development, and performing extensive validation, we are able to provide a high confidence list of mouse imprinted genes including 18 novel genes. This shows that cluster size varies dynamically during development and can be substantially larger than previously thought, with the <italic>Igf2r</italic> cluster extending over 10 Mb in placenta.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25125.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25125.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>genomic imprinting</kwd><kwd>XCI escapers</kwd><kwd>allelic expression</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>H3K27ac</kwd><kwd>strain-biased expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P25185-B22</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hudson</surname><given-names>Quanah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F4302-B09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barlow</surname><given-names>Denise P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W1207-B09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barlow</surname><given-names>Denise P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Allele-specific expression due to genetic differences, X-chromosome inactivation or genomic imprinting, varies dynamically throughout development, and may be explained by allele-specific differences in stability or the actions of tissue-specific enhancers.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allele-specific expression can occur in different contexts during mammalian development and affect a wide-range of processes. Random monoallelic expression at the single-cell level has been reported to be relatively common and plays an important role in the maturation of the lymphoid cell lineage where allelic exclusion of T and B cell receptors is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reinius and Sandberg, 2015</xref>). At the tissue level such cases appear biallelic, but genetic and epigenetic differences between the alleles can lead to allele-specific biases in populations of cells or the whole organism.</p><p>Genetic differences between the alleles of mammalian genes frequently cause allele-specific expression differences in human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Geuvadis Consortium et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crowley et al., 2015</xref>). The sequence of the two alleles can vary at single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can alter gene expression by modulating transcription factor binding to gene promoters or distal and proximal activating regions called enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leung et al., 2015</xref>). Active enhancers are marked by the H3K27ac histone modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>) and can activate one or more promoters by direct interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>). Allelic expression can also be caused by epigenetic differences between the alleles, notably in the developmentally important processes of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and genomic imprinting. In both cases, a long non-coding (lnc) RNA can cause the initiation of silencing, with <italic>Xist</italic> initiating XCI, and some clusters of imprinted genes being silenced by an imprinted lncRNA.</p><p>In female mammals, the <italic>Xist</italic> lncRNA is expressed from one of the two X chromosomes leading to widespread epigenetic silencing of X-linked genes apart from a subset that escape XCI, reported to be 3% in mouse and 15% in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berletch et al., 2011</xref>), although other reports indicate that the number of escapers in mouse may be higher at around 13% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calabrese et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Xist</italic> uses the three-dimensional structure of the X-chromosome to gain access to distant parts of the chromosome from which it spreads to eventually coat the whole inactive X and cause XCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engreitz et al., 2013</xref>). Current evidence indicates that <italic>Xist</italic> initiates silencing by interacting with SPEN that then recruits HDAC3 to cause hypoacetylation of the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monfort et al., 2015</xref>). A series of factors are then recruited that establish the repressive chromatin state required to maintaining silencing, including the Polycomb Repressive Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and 2), DNMT1, SAF-A and ASH2L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wutz, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Imprinted genes are mostly clustered with allele-specific silencing regulated by a distant differential DNA methylated imprint control element (ICE). In the most common mechanism, the unmethylated ICE acts as a promoter for a lncRNA that silences a cluster of genes, as shown for <italic>Airn</italic> and <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> in the <italic>Igf2r</italic> and <italic>Kcnq1</italic> clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mancini-Dinardo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sleutels et al., 2002</xref>). Both <italic>Airn</italic> and <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> have been associated with the histone-modifying enzymes EHMT2 and PRC2, and are thought to guide deposition of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 to silence distant genes in these clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nagano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Terranova et al., 2008</xref>). However, <italic>Airn</italic> directly silences the overlapped <italic>Igf2r</italic> by transcriptional interference, a process not requiring these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Latos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mager et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nagano et al., 2008</xref>). It has been hypothesized that disruption of enhancer activity may be the first step in initiating silencing of imprinted genes distant from the lncRNA locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pauler et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Extensive studies on the influence of SNPs on allelic expression and disease association have been performed in human adult tissues or cell culture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leung et al., 2015</xref>). RNA-seq on mouse tissues from F1 crosses have been used to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lagarrigue et al., 2013</xref>), escape from XCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berletch et al., 2015</xref>) and imprinted expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeVeale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babak et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2008</xref>), but studies of total allelic expression have been lacking. We have pioneered an approach to classify allelic expression of all genes in a tissue from RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andergassen et al., 2015</xref>), and apply this here to map the allelic expression states of protein-coding (pc) and non-coding (nc) genes in 23 different mouse tissues and developmental stages to define the mouse Allelome. This revealed that biases in allelic expression of pc-genes are highly tissue-specific in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prickett and Oakey, 2012</xref>), while nc-genes tended to show a consistent bias when expressed. Following this, in the 19 females tissues we confirmed reports that XCI escapers can be tissue-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berletch et al., 2015</xref>), and found an unusually high proportion of escapers in leg muscle (&gt;50%). By assembling a high confidence list of validated or supported imprinted genes, we found that an even larger proportion than previously thought belong to clusters (&gt;90%), that these clusters can be much larger than previously reported, and that they expand and contract during development, reaching their maximum in extra-embryonic tissues. In particular, we found that the <italic>Igf2r</italic> cluster expanded to 10 Mb in placenta, representing the largest <italic>cis</italic> co-regulated region outside of the X chromosome. For all types of allelic expression that we investigated we found an association with nearby allele-specific H3K27ac enrichment, indicating that allele-specific expression may be mediated through genetic differences in enhancers or by epigenetic repression established on enhancers during XCI and imprinted silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The mouse gene expression Allelome shows tissue-specific variation</title><p>To investigate how allelic expression varies between tissues and during development, we first generated a near complete picture of allelic expression, or the mouse Allelome.

To enable analysis of X chromosome allelic expression, we collected single female (XX) organs, except for embryonic day (E) 12.5 liver, E9.5 VE and E12.5 VE where tissues from a litter were pooled (mix of XX/XY), and embryonic stem (ES) cells, which were derived from male (XY) blastocysts. We performed total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to maximise sensitivity by detecting SNPs in the introns, and also to allow detection of non-polyadenylated nc-genes. Unsupervised clustering confirmed the quality of the dataset by showing that replicates of the same tissue clustered together, closest to the same organ at different developmental stages as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We analyzed these data for biases in allelic expression using Allelome.PRO with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% (based on mock comparisons of the allelic score (the log<sub>10</sub>(p) value for deviations from an allelic ratio of 0.5 calculated based on the binomial distribution)), an allelic ratio cutoff of 0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andergassen et al., 2015</xref>), a custom annotation, and SNPs from the Sanger database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keane et al., 2011</xref>). We previously validated the Allelome.PRO strategy in F1 crosses of inbred mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andergassen et al., 2015</xref>), and the approach is described in more detail in this paper and accompanying manual, as well as in the Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>. The pipeline requires a single allelic ratio cutoff in order to be able to classify all annotated genes into allelic expression categories. We chose an allelic ratio cutoff of 0.7, because previous analysis showed that most known imprinted genes were above this level, as were known strain biased genes on the X chromosome due to a bias in X chromosome inactivation in CAST/FVB F1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andergassen et al., 2015</xref>). To generate a comprehensive annotation that covered all transcripts present in our dataset, we combined the RefSeq mouse annotation for pc- and nc-genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pruitt et al., 2014</xref>), with nc-loci not in RefSeq detected by reference based assembly from our data, as detailed in the Materials and methods. Analysis with RNAcode and CPC indicated that the coding potential of our nc-loci was significantly less than for pc-genes, but not distinguishable from RefSeq nc-genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Washietl et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In summary, our combined annotation had a total of 20743 pc-gene and 9068 nc-gene loci (including 2778 RefSeq nc-genes).</p><p>Using this approach, we classified allelic expression of pc- and nc-genes in the above 23 tissues as showing biallelic expression (BAE), not informative due to no or low expression (NI), not informative due to no SNPs (NS), strain-biased toward the CAST or FVB allele, imprinted maternal expression (MAT) or paternal expression (PAT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Biallelic genes included genes with a consistent strain bias where the median of the replicates is below the allelic ratio cutoff (40.4–57.0%), genes that fluctuate in the direction of strain bias between the replicates below the allelic ratio cutoff (36.7–50.1%), and genes that fluctuate in the direction of strain bias with at least one replicate above the allelic ratio cutoff (4.8–10.4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). For autosomes, the total number of BAE pc-genes showed limited variation between tissues and developmental stages, varying 1.4-fold between 7979–11,574 genes from the 19,772 annotated pc-genes, or 40–59% of the total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, first row). The number of non-informative pc-genes showed a reciprocal pattern for each tissue, varying between 7669–11467 genes (39–58.0% of the total), while 723 genes (3.7%) could not be assessed due to a lack of SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, second row). Low tissue-specific variation in the number of BAE pc-genes is partly explained by genes that showed biallelic expression in multiple tissues, with 31% of biallelic genes showing biallelic expression in all 23 tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, top). In contrast, the number of pc-genes showing strain-biased and imprinted expression varied greatly between tissues. Genes showing strain-biased expression varied 4.7-fold among the different tissues from between 174–825 genes, or 0.9–4.2% of the total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, third row). Overall strain bias toward the FVB allele was 1.9-fold higher than strain bias toward the CAST allele, which may reflect an alignment bias due to FVB having a shorter genetic distance to the C57BL/6 reference genome. Genes showing imprinted expression showed the most tissue-specific variation, varying 7.2-fold between the different tissues from 7 to 51 genes, or 0.035–0.258% of the total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, fourth row). Overall, there was no difference in the distribution of allelic ratio of autosomal genes between the tissues with all tissues showing a median allelic ratio around 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>The proportion of autosomal nc-genes classified BAE per tissue was much lower than for pc-genes, and showed greater tissue-specific variation, varying 3.7-fold from 262 to 970 genes or 3.0–11.1% of the total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, first row). High variation is likely due to the known tight tissue-specific expression of lncRNAs that make up most of the nc-genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Necsulea et al., 2014</xref>), as was further indicated by the high proportion of nc-genes that were non-informative in each tissue (87.3–95.5% of the total, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, second row). Reflecting this, in contrast to pc-genes only a small minority of nc-genes were biallelically expressed in all 23 tissues (50 of 2673, 1.8%) and the majority showed biallelic expression in one tissue only (963 of 2673, 36.9%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, bottom). As for pc-genes, a low proportion of nc-genes could not be assessed due to a lack of SNPs (700 genes or 8.0% of the total). There was a similar high degree of variation in the number of nc-genes showing strain bias (4.5 fold, 68–310 transcripts, 0.77–3.5% of the total) or imprinted expression (6.5 fold, 4–26 transcripts, 0.045–0.29% of the total) as was seen for pc-genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, third and fourth rows).</p><p>In summary, mapping the Allelome revealed tissue-specific variation in the number of strain-biased and imprinted genes for both pc- and nc-genes, while the number of BAE genes was similar between tissues for pc-, but not nc-genes. Interestingly, the number of pc- and nc-genes in each allelic expression category appeared to co-vary between tissues, with the total number of pc- and nc- informative genes showing a high correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.77, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, Pearson).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Tissue-specific strain-biased expression correlates with strain-biased enhancer marks</title><p>The variation in the absolute number of strain-biased pc- and nc-genes was also reflected in the proportion of strain-biased genes relative to the number of informative genes per tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The proportion of pc-genes showing strain-biased expression (1.6% (embryonic brain) - 8.7% (ESC)) was generally lower than for nc-genes (10.0% (neonatal brain) - 34.8% (E16.5 VE)). This may reflect the known high evolution rate of lncRNAs that may lead to strain-specific lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Necsulea et al., 2014</xref>) and is in line with recent findings that lncRNAs vary significantly more than pc-genes between people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kornienko et al., 2016</xref>). However, we found that the number of pc- and nc- strain-biased genes detected per tissue was correlated (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.71, p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>, Pearson), indicating that some may be co-regulated.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25125.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The Allelome reveals tissue-specific expression of strain-biased genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The percentage of strain-biased genes from total informative genes for each tissue for protein-coding (pc, black) and non-coding (nc, grey) genes.

We found that most biallelic genes remained biallelic wherever they are expressed for both pc- and nc-genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> left), although the majority of nc-genes were expressed only in one tissue, whereas most pc- genes are expressed in multiple tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Most strain-biased nc-genes did not change their allelic status between tissues, whereas pc-genes could be categorized into two groups based on whether they maintained their allelic status between tissues or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> right). The first group (134 CAST and 249 FVB) maintained strain-biased expression in 95–100% of the tissues where they were expressed, whereas the second group containing the majority of strain-biased genes (433 CAST and 569 FVB) maintained their allelic status in only 5–90% of the tissues. Further indicating that strain-biased expression is tissue-specific and that genes can switch their allelic expression status between tissues, unsupervised clustering using the allelic ratio of strain-biased genes that were informative in all tissues largely reflected the developmental relationship of the tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to determine if tissue-specific strain-biased expression may be explained by the activity of strain-biased enhancers. To investigate this we used Allelome.PRO to detect allelic enrichment of H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) data from FVB x CAST reciprocal crosses for fetal liver and VE, and compared this to the RNA-seq analysis for these tissues. In both fetal liver and VE, we found that H3K27ac informative windows were mostly biallelic, with only between 1.6% (VE) and 11.3% (fetal liver) informative windows showing a strain bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We chose genes that switched from strain-biased expression in one tissue to biallelic expression in the other, and then examined H3K27ac enrichment ±50 kb from the transcription start site (TSS) (detailed in the Materials and methods). For both CAST and FVB strain-biased genes, we found strain-biased H3K27ac enrichment both upstream and downstream of the TSS matching the strain-biased expression, while no enrichment was seen when the same genes were biallelic in the other tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, sheet C, note that BAE enrichment was not expected since BAE windows were overrepresented in the genome [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>]). This enrichment was explained by 39/144 (27%) strain-biased to BAE switchers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, sheet C), such as <italic>Glrx</italic> where a change from FVB biased expression in liver to BAE in VE was correlated with a putative switch in enhancer usage matching the allelic expression status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To investigate if other strain-biased expression may be explained by allele-specific differences in post-transcriptional degradation, we took the strain-biased genes for E12.5 MEFs, fetal liver and VE where we also had matching H3K4me3 data, and calculated the allelic ratio separately for the introns (nascent transcript) and exons (mature transcript). The set of strain-biased genes with biallelic H3K4me3 over their promoters were enriched for genes with biallelic introns (nascent transcript) but strain-biased exons (mature transcript), indicating that these genes may be strain-biased due to post-transcriptional differences in stability (59%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, strain-biased genes with monoallelic H3K4me3 on their promoters were strongly enriched for genes that showed a strain bias in both the introns and exons (86%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that the bias occurred at the transcriptional level presumably due to SNPs in regulatory regions such as enhancers as indicated previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Altogether these results indicate that tissue-specific strain-biased expression may occur due to a switch in enhancer usage between tissues, from an enhancer that shows strain-biased activity to one that shows biallelic activity, or due to tissue-specific differences in post-transcriptional stability between the alleles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Escape from X-inactivation is tissue-specific and correlates with increased distance from monoallelic enhancers</title><p>We used 19 female tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to define the Allelome for the X-chromosome, 16 epiblast-derived embryonic, neonatal and adult tissues showing random X chromosome inactivation (XCI), and three extra-embryonic tissues showing imprinted XCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In inbred mouse strains, both X-chromosomes in epiblast-derived tissues have an equal chance to express the <italic>Xist</italic> lncRNA gene leading to random inactivation; however, in CAST/FVB F1 mice the FVB allele is preferentially inactivated due to a bias in <italic>Xist</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calaway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chadwick et al., 2006</xref>). In extra-embryonic tissues <italic>Xist</italic> is expressed only from the paternal allele, leading to inactivation of the paternal allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kay et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, in this F1 cross XCI escapers can be detected as genes that do not show the expected CAST bias (around 0.7 allelic ratio in epiblast-derived tissues) or MAT bias (close to an allelic ratio of 1.0 in extra-embryonic tissues) in expression, but rather show BAE or an unexpected bias (note: to conservatively call BAE escapers a lower allelic ratio cutoff of 0.6 was used for this analysis, see Materials and methods for details). Using this approach across the 19 XX female tissues, we detected 250 candidate escaper genes (225 random XCI and 43 imprinted XCI escapers, 18 escape in both) from 1044 X chromosome genes (792 pc- and 252 nc-genes), with a further 178 genes (14.6%) unable to be assessed due to a lack of SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, sheets D-E). These included 31 out of 55 previously reported XCI escaper genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berletch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). The high number of escapers detected could be due to the sensitivity of our method, as there was a tendency for more escapers to be detected at lower expression levels, but when the number of escapers at different expression levels was normalized for the number of informative genes, then there was no difference indicating this was not an artifact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The number of genes escaping XCI varied considerably between tissues from 1 to 108 pc-genes (0.4–52.1% of informative pc-genes), and from 1 to 10 for nc-genes including <italic>Xist</italic> (0.4–71.4% of informative nc-genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> top, middle).

We found that previously reported XCI escapers from the spleen, brain and placenta that we detected in our data had a higher median SNP coverage than novel XCI escapers, which showed a similar median SNP coverage to leg muscle XCI escapers, further indicating that the sensitivity of our approach may partly explain the high number of escapers detected in leg muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berletch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finn et al., 2014</xref>).

We found the highest number of known imprinted genes in placenta, brain and in neonatal tongue. In general, in extra-embryonic tissues and post-implantation embryonic and neonatal tissues more genes showed imprinted expression than in pluripotent and adult tissues (with the exception of brain). Interestingly, the number of imprinted genes detected tended to decrease within the same tissue during development (see placenta, brain, liver, heart). Tissues important for the energy transfer from the mother to the offspring, the placenta, neonatal tongue and mammary glands, showed a relatively high number of imprinted genes. However, we found a similar pattern in imprinted expression between the brain and mammary glands collected from virgin and lactating females, indicating no obvious role for imprinted expression during lactation.</p><p>Tissue-specific imprinted expression could be directly explained by gene expression patterns, with a gene showing imprinted expression wherever it is expressed, or the allelic status of imprinted genes could switch between tissues. To investigate this, we examined the imprinted status across tissues of all known imprinted genes confirmed by RNA-seq in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). This analysis showed that imprinted pc-genes can be categorized into two groups based on the consistency of their allelic status in tissues where they are expressed. The first group (‘a’) showed variable imprinted expression (in ≤70% of expressing tissues, e.g. <italic>Ago2</italic> and <italic>Slc22a3</italic>), while a second group (‘b’) showed consistent imprinted expression (in &gt;70% of expressing tissues, e.g. <italic>Igf2r</italic>). Imprinted nc-genes showed consistent imprinted expression where they were expressed (group ‘b’, e.g. <italic>Airn</italic>), with the exception of <italic>Xist</italic> whose imprinted expression was restricted to extra-embryonic tissues. In summary, we found that a large proportion of known imprinted pc-genes (47%, group ‘a’) changed allelic status between tissues indicating tissue-specific regulation of imprinted expression, while in contrast imprinted nc-genes showed imprinted expression wherever they were expressed. This is in agreement with a recent study in human that found that most imprinted genes were tissue-specific and showed biallelic expression in another tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baran et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Novel validated imprinted genes belong to known clusters</title><p>Our analysis of RNA-seq data from 23 tissues identified 76 novel imprinted gene candidates that were not present in public databases, and required further validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In E12.5 VE, <italic>Slc38a4</italic> showed biallelic expression due to expression from an alternative downstream promoter, but paternal enrichment over the canonical promoter that is a maternally methylated gametic differentially methylated region (gDMR, red diamond <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) that has not yet been validated as an ICE. This indicated that paternal expression of <italic>Slc38a4</italic> may be masked by a higher level of expression from the biallelic isoform, which was supported by a paternal bias in expression below the allelic ratio cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, paternal expression in E9.5 VE and biallelic expression without a bias in E16.5 VE indicated that <italic>Slc38a4</italic> switches from an imprinted to BAE isoform during VE development, while XLOC_032279 maintained imprinted expression at all stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that XLOC_032279 is an independent imprinted gene that may belong to an imprinted cluster together with <italic>Slc38a4,</italic> which was previously thought to be a solo imprinted gene,.</p><p>Maternal imprinted expression in placenta requires validation to distinguish it from expression in maternal decidua, blood and blood vessels that ‘contaminate’ the placenta. By comparing expression by RNA-seq in decidua with placenta, we found that 11/19 placental-specific maternal imprinted expression candidates had a decidua/placenta ratio &gt;5 indicating they could result from maternal contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Another three candidates had a low decidua/placenta ratio but are genes expressed specifically in blood (<italic>Ppbp</italic>, <italic>Hbb-bs</italic>, <italic>Hbb-b1</italic>), indicating that they too could result from expression in maternal tissue. To definitively test for maternal contamination, we transferred CAST/FVB F1 blastocysts into FVB host mothers, collected placentas at E12.5 and then performed RNA-seq and Allelome.PRO analysis to determine the allelic expression status of candidate placental-specific maternal imprinted expression candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We found that all 19 of the known maternal imprinted genes that we detected in placenta in the initial experiment showed the expected maternal CAST expression bias in the embryo transfer experiment indicating true maternal imprinted expression, although two of these genes, <italic>Ano1</italic> and <italic>Phactr2,</italic> had a maternal bias below the allelic ratio cutoff of 0.7 that we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We found that 10/19 novel maternally expressed candidates had a bias toward the FVB allele of the host mother indicating maternal contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), all of which were expressed in blood or decidua (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, all five validated novel maternal candidates with a bias toward the maternal CAST allele were in close proximity to the <italic>Igf2r</italic> imprinted cluster (<italic>XLOC_037414, Park2</italic>, <italic>Smoc2 Thbs2</italic> and <italic>Arid1b (Arid1b</italic> showed a CAST bias below the 0.7 allelic cutoff)), while 4/19 candidates were not informative in this experiment, most likely due to lower sequencing coverage. We further validated these five candidates (all showed a maternal bias although <italic>XLOC_037414</italic> and <italic>Arid1b</italic> were below the 0.7 allelic ratio cutoff), plus two additional maternal imprinted expression candidates (including <italic>Dact2</italic> near the <italic>Igf2r</italic> imprinted cluster) and six paternal imprinted expression candidates by RNA-seq of placentas from a different F1 cross (two reciprocal crosses from BALBc/CAST E12.5 placentas, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>As noted above, six of the placental maternal imprinted expression candidates, as well as the known solo gene <italic>Pde10a</italic> that shows maternal imprinted expression only in placenta, were in close proximity to the known <italic>Igf2r</italic> cluster on chromosome 17. Therefore, we took advantage of the existing R2Δ mouse model that has a deletion of the <italic>Igf2r</italic> ICE and <italic>Airn</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wutz et al., 2001</xref>), to genetically test if these genes are part of the <italic>Igf2r</italic> imprinted cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We compared expression in CAST/FVB with CAST/R2D E12.5 placentas and found either a reduction in allelic ratio from maternal biased to biallelic and/or a significant increase in expression for candidates near the <italic>Igf2r</italic> cluster (<italic>Pde10a</italic>, <italic>Park2</italic>, <italic>Dact2</italic>, <italic>Smoc2</italic>, and <italic>Thbs2</italic>, <italic>Arid1b</italic> showed a maternal bias below the 0.7 ratio). <italic>XLOC_037414</italic> had low SNP coverage in this experiment, and did not show a difference in the ratio in the R2Δ mutant. However, the validation of the initial finding of maternal imprinted expression in placenta by differential H3K4me3 enrichment, plus a maternal expression bias in the embryo transfer experiment and BALBc x CAST cross, indicates that <italic>Arid1b</italic> and its bidirectional transcript <italic>XLOC_037414</italic> are true imprinted genes regulated by <italic>Airn</italic>, although the degree of imprinted bias may be less than for other genes in the <italic>Igf2r</italic> cluster. In summary, this experiment demonstrates that <italic>Airn</italic> lncRNA causes imprinted silencing of genes over a 10 Mb region (7.7 Mb upstream and 1.9 Mb downstream of the ICE), extending the size of the <italic>Igf2r</italic> imprinted cluster from its previously known size of 450 kb, and making it the largest <italic>cis</italic>-regulated autosomal region.</p><p>Following validation, we were able to confirm 70 known imprinted genes as described above (68 if <italic>Meg3</italic> is a single imprinted transcript overlapping the <italic>Rian</italic> and <italic>Mirg</italic> loci) and 23 novel imprinted genes from the 76 candidates detected by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, sheets G-J). These 23 novel imprinted genes had supporting evidence in addition to their initial detection from RNA-seq data, with 16 in the ‘validated’ category showing either genetic evidence (a loss of imprinted expression following <italic>Airn</italic> promoter deletion indicating a gene belongs to <italic>Igf2r</italic> imprinted cluster), differential H3K4me3 enrichment correlating with imprinted expression (independent technique), embryo transfer supporting maternal imprinted expression (for placenta candidates), and/or detection in BALBc/CAST crosses (different F1 cross). The other seven were in the ‘supported’ category having been detected in multiple tissues or developmental stages and/or being located within 7 Mb of a gDMR or imprinted region (the gDMR has been shown to be the ICE in all seven tested cases, while 7 Mb was the maximum distance to the ICE that we observed in the expanded <italic>Igf2r</italic> cluster). A total of 5/23 of these novel imprinted genes (<italic>Qk, Park2, Dact2</italic>, <italic>Fkbp6</italic> and <italic>Platr20</italic>) were recently confirmed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calabrese et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strogantsev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babak et al., 2015</xref>), leaving 18 that were novel to this study. Of the remaining candidates 16/76 were ‘fragments’, nc-genes with supported imprinted expression, but neighboring known imprinted genes, and with no H3K4me3 peak to support their existence as independent transcripts. Another 24/76 were candidates detected in one tissue by RNA-seq, but without any supporting evidence for their imprinted expression, and 13/76 were false-positive maternal imprinted expression candidates from placenta due to expression in contaminating maternal decidua or blood.

In the <italic>Igf2r</italic> cluster, we found that maternal enrichment of H3K27ac correlated with cluster size, with no enrichment detected for embryonic liver, maternal enrichment windows detected within 2 Mb of the ICE in VE, and up to 7 Mb away in placenta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, upper panel). Genome wide we found only a background level of parental-specific H3K27ac enrichment in embryonic liver, whereas VE and placenta showed a significant enrichment of parental-specific H3K27ac in imprinted regions (see Materials and methods for details). Quantifying this for VE and placenta, we found that the extent of H3K27ac expansion correlated with cluster size for these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lower panel).</p><p>Altogether, we found that all types of allele-specific expression that we examined were highly tissue-specific.

For all types of allele-specific expression, we found an association with nearby allele-specific H3K27ac enrichment, indicating that allele-specific expression due to both genetic and epigenetic causes may be mediated through enhancers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Biases in allelic expression in mammals due to genetic or epigenetic causes can have significant phenotypic consequences, but a comprehensive profile of this has been lacking. Here, using the Allelome.PRO approach that classifies the allelic expression status of all genes in a tissue, we profiled allelic expression in 23 mouse tissues and developmental stages from RNA-seq data. In combination with extensive validation, this provides a valuable resource of strain-biased genes between CAST and FVB, XCI escapers, and together with previous literature, a high confidence list of imprinted genes in mouse, with 93 imprinted genes including 18 genes novel to this study. These data revealed that strain-biased expression, the extent of XCI and imprinted expression were highly tissue-specific. In particular, we show that imprinted gene cluster size varies between tissues and during development, and that they are at their maximum size in extra-embryonic tissues. Interestingly, we found that allelic expression was associated with differential enrichment of H3K27ac in adjacent regions.</p><p>Genetic polymorphisms can lead to expression biases in humans, but the outbred nature of the human population makes it difficult to assess the effect the same polymorphism has on allelic expression in different tissues. By using replicates of F1 tissues from crosses of inbred mouse strains, we were able to assess the allelic expression of strain-biased genes in different tissues with the same genetic background. It could be that strain-biased expression is simply a reflection of tissue-specific expression, and that a bias is observed wherever a gene is expressed. However, we found that more often strain-biased genes showed a switch in allelic status between tissues, that in a sub-set of cases correlated with an apparent switch in enhancer usage with different allelic biases, indicating that strain-biased expression may result from genetic differences in tissue-specific enhancers that control tissue-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leung et al., 2015</xref>). Our results indicated that other strain-biased expression may be explained by allele-specific differences in post-transcriptional stability, which could lead to tissue-specific strain-biased expression due to tissue-specific expression of miRNAs or RNA binding proteins that bind and affect the stability of the transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaidatzis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Geuvadis Consortium et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>Xist</italic> expression leading to XCI and the parental-allele-specific DNA-methylated ICEs that control imprinted expression are present in almost every cell type during development, so it might be expected that if a gene subject to epigenetic silencing by these processes is expressed then it would always be silenced on one allele. However, this is not the case. We found that so-called ubiquitous XCI escapers that escape in many tissues were in the minority, with most XCI escapers escaping silencing only in 1 or 2 tissues. Tissue-specific and ubiquitous XCI escapers were previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berletch et al., 2015</xref>), but our study encompassing 19 females tissues enabled us to obtain a more accurate picture of the tissue-specific nature of XCI escapers. Similarly, a high proportion of imprinted genes showed tissue-specific imprinted expression where they switched to BAE in another tissue. These results showed that biases in allelic expression are generally tissue-specific, whether they arise from genetic or epigenetic causes, indicating that tissue-specific features are responsible for switches in allelic status. Interestingly, we found a novel maternally expressed gene on the X chromosome called <italic>CrossFirre</italic>, that as the only X-linked imprinted gene that we validated, may warrant further investigation for a connection to imprinted XCI.</p><p>Related to the variable tissue-specific imprinted expression, we found that the size of imprinted clusters varied during development, showing a minimum size in pluripotent ESC and a maximum in extra-embryonic tissues. These results have interesting parallels with XCI, with ESC showing two active alleles prior to the onset of random XCI, while extra-embryonic tissues are the only post-implantation tissues to show imprinted XCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wutz, 2011</xref>). Specifically, we showed that the <italic>Igf2r</italic> imprinted cluster is much larger than previously thought extending over 10 Mb in placenta, or around 10% of mouse chromosome 17. The scale of the region affected by imprinted silenced by <italic>Airn</italic> is reminiscent of XCI by <italic>Xist</italic>. Early in XCI <italic>Xist</italic> recruits PRC1 and PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wutz, 2011</xref>), repressive histone modifying complexes that have also been associated with <italic>Airn</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Terranova et al., 2008</xref>), further indicating that they may act by a similar mechanism to cause silencing of distant genes.</p><p>The H3K27ac histone modification marks open chromatin and has been associated with active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>). Following this we found that a switch from strain-biased to BAE between tissues may be explained by tissue-specific enhancer usage associated with the corresponding H3K27ac enrichment. We also found an association between allelic H3K27ac enrichment and genes subject to XCI and imprinted silencing. <italic>Xist</italic> is reported to target H3K27me3 deposition to regions that remain marked by H3K27ac on the active allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calabrese et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that the distance to allele-specific enrichment of H3K27ac was greater for XCI escapers than for genes subject to XCI. Enhancers explain tissue-specific expression, so it follows that tissue-specific silencing seen for XCI and imprinted silencing may be explained by actions on tissue-specific enhancers. Following this we found that the size of an imprinted cluster in a particular tissue correlated with size of the region showing parental-allele specific H3K27ac enrichment. Together these results indicate that all types of allele-specific expression that we observed may be mediated by allele-specific actions on enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>Mice were bred and housed according to Austrian regulations under Laboratory Animal Facility Permit MA58-0375/2007/4.

To annotate the regions not covered by RefSeq, we combined the reads from the four samples for each tissue using SAMtools (version 1.2) and used Cufflinks (version 2.2.1) to perform a reference based assembly.

A t-test was performed between mRNAs (RefSeq NM), non-coding RNAs (RefSeq NR) and genes annotated in this study (XLOC) for the CPC and RNA-code score. As expected, we observed a highly significant difference between RefSeq mRNAs (NM) and RefSeq non-coding RNAs (NR) for both the CPC and the RNA-code score (CPC t = 56.4326 [2.239631;2.400904], p-value&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>, RNAcode t = 39.6171 [34.44711;38.03595], p-value&lt;2.2×10<sup>16</sup>).

Briefly, for each tissue, a gene or region was classified as showing an imprinted or strain bias if all replicates showed the same direction of bias, the allelic score of all biological replicates passed the FDR cutoff (allelic score was defined as the log<sub>10</sub>(p) value calculated from deviations from the binomial distribution of summed reads, the FDR was defined by mock comparisons of the allelic score), and the median allelic ratio was above or equal to the allelic ratio cutoff. Informative genes that did not fulfill these criteria were classified as biallelic. A gene was classified as informative in a given tissue if a minimum SNP coverage was reached for all replicates. This was defined as the minimum SNP coverage required to pass the FDR allelic score cutoff assuming that the allelic ratio would be equal to the allelic ratio cutoff.</p><p>For each annotated region, two allelic scores were calculated, a strain biased score (s.score, calculated by comparing summed FVB and CAST reads) and a parental biased or imprinted score (i.score, calculated by comparing summed maternal and paternal reads), and assigned a positive or negative value based on the direction of bias (MAT &gt;0, PAT &lt;0, imprinted score, CAST &gt;0, FVB &lt;0 strain biased score). A summary i.score and s.score were calculated for each gene or region by taking the minimum score of the replicates when each replicate showed the same direction of bias, and setting the summary score to 0 when any replicates showed disagreement. Therefore, each gene or region had either a summary i.score or summary s.score with the other score set to 0, or both summary allelic scores were set to 0.</p><p>For allelic analysis with an allelic ratio cutoff of 0.7 (all analysis except the X chromosome inactivation (XCI) escaper analysis), the minimum SNP coverage required for a gene to be called informative varied between tissues from 11 to 13 reads, with a mean of 12 reads.

The remaining H3K27ac windows were assigned to genes in our annotation if they were within ±50 kb of the TSS (genes without SNPs were excluded, a window could be associated with more than one gene). For informative windows assigned to genes, we calculated the distance to the TSS (upstream (-) or downstream (+) taken from the middle of the window). We then shuffled the allelic status of the H3K27ac windows 100x to generate a random dataset that we subsequently used to calculate enrichment over random.</p><p>We selected a subset of genes for further analysis that showed strain-biased expression for CAST or FVB in liver or VE that then switched to BAE in the other tissue.

Next we removed strain-biased switchers where H3K4me3 peaks did not overlap the promoter (±2 kb of the annotated TSS) in both tissues.

The number of windows detected for each category were counted in 4 kb bins over ±50 kb from the TSS, and enrichment over random calculated for each bin by dividing this number by the mean count for this category from the 100x shuffled allelic tags for the same genes. The H3K27ac enrichment was then plotted for BAE, CAST and FVB for each expression status (CAST, BAE (switching from CAST), FVB and BAE (switching from FVB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Second, we downloaded the RefSeq gene annotation from introns and exons separately using the USCS table browser, and extracted exonic and intronic SNPs using BEDtools (intersect). Allelome:PRO was then used to calculate allele-specific expression for intronic and exonic reads separately using these SNP files and the same gene annotation as for other analysis. We then kept only genes that were classified as strain-biased or BAE in their exons and introns. Finally, we merged data from strain-biased genes with BAE or monoallelic H3K4me3 enrichment on their promoter (step 1), with strain-biased genes that were classified as BAE or monoallelic in both their exons and introns (step 2), and kept the overlap.

To increase the stringency in defining XCI escapers, we used a lower allelic ratio cutoff of 0.6 for the Allelome.PRO analysis, compared to all other analysis in this study (note: genes below the allelic ratio cutoff are classified biallelic, and therefore escapers). In addition, we excluded genes where all four replicates showed the expected MAT or CAST bias and a median allelic ratio above the cutoff, but were classified biallelic by Allelome.PRO because one or more replicates were below the FDR cutoff due to low expression.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We have sent your manuscript out to two reviewers for their evaluations. Below you will find the reviews provided by these reviewers. As you will see, each of the reviewers agrees that there are potentially important biological insights contained in this manuscript. However, there are several issues relating to clarity and the presentation of the data described. While at this moment we conclude that your manuscript is not ready for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, a revised version that addresses the issues raised by the reviewers would be of interest.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript entitled &quot;Mapping the mouse Allelome reveals tissue-specific regulation of allelic expression&quot; Andergassen et al. present a comprehensive analysis of the mouse Allelome. The authors generate RNA-Seq data from 23 different developmental stages including 19 female tissues from F1 crosses between FVB and CAST mice. The results of the authors' analyses show that allele specific expression is highly tissue-specific and also show that this behavior is regulated by tissue-specific enhancers. In so doing, they identify imprinted genes and compare against the current literature. Lastly, they show that the allelic behavior occurs in larger genomic clusters than previously expected.</p><p>While the data presented in this manuscript could be an interesting and useful resource describing allelic behavior in the mouse genome there are a number of concerns (listed below) that should be addressed to provide some clarity to the conclusions and to assist readers in their comprehension.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use the own software Allelome. PRO that has previously been published in NAR to perform their allelic analysis. They are not clear about the parameters and thresholds that they use to perform these analyses. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> they present the &quot;allelic score cutoff&quot; which is never defined. They use an allelic ratio cutoff of 0.7 (they use a ratio of 0.6 for the XCI analysis on the basis that it is more stringent) which seems somewhat arbitrary and never justify its choice (or the dependence of their results on these parameters).</p><p>2) Their definition of bi-allelic expression (BAE) includes genes that have allelic expression ratios of less than 0.7 but also includes genes that are greater than 0.7 but are inconsistent between replicates – shouldn't this second category of genes be called ambiguous rather than biallelic and separated out?</p><p>3) Near the start of the paper (Results section) the authors classify genes as strain-biased for either CAST of FVB – these are a different set of genes from the maternal and paternal allele-expressed genes that they also find. They use these sets of genes throughout the manuscript. In looking throughout the paper including the supplemental methods there appears to be no definition as to what the authors mean by strain-biased genes (or define the parameters used to call genes in this category).</p><p>4) In their analysis of regulation of allele-specific genes the authors use the H3K27ac signal in a window of +/- 50 kb from the TSS of the target gene. They then use a procedure of computing the enrichment of allelic behavior of H3K27ac windows of 4kb in size compared to randomly shuffled windows. First, H3K27ac signal is localized to the TSS of an active gene, thus why is such a large window around the TSS needed – shouldn't it be localized no more than a kb from the TSS. Additionally, why perform the enrichment compared to a shuffled null? Can't one just compute the allelic signal of a genomic window centered on the TSS and compare the direction of the allelic bias (if there is one) with the target gene being regulated?</p><p>More technical issues:</p><p>1) In subsection “Escape from X-inactivation is tissue-specific and correlates with increased distance from monoallelic enhancers” they compute the significance of the escapers being further from H3K27ac windows compared to non-escapers and quote a significance of p&lt;1e-20 and refer to the material and methods. In the Material and methods however, the authors present the analysis for this claim and show that the significance using a Fisher's exact test is p&lt;1e-17.</p><p>2) In both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and Figure 2—figure supplement 2C the use of similar colors such as green, blue and similar shades to correctly distinguish the features of the figures.</p><p>3) While &quot;Allelome&quot; seems OK, the use of &quot;Escapome&quot; seems unnecessary and unhelpful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25125.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The authors use the own software Allelome.

There we showed that most known imprinted genes had an allelic ratio cutoff above 0.7, a cutoff that also captured 85% of genes showing a known strain bias in expression on the X chromosome between CAST and FVB. We have now inserted a sentence into the Results section of this paper emphasizing this point to explain why we chose the 0.7 allelic ratio cutoff (subsection “The mouse gene expression Allelome shows tissue-specific variation”). The Allelome.PRO parameters and thresholds used for most analyses are given in the main text in the Results section, while the parameters for each specific analysis are given in the figure legends and Material and methods.</p><p>The allelic score is the log<sub>10</sub>(p) probability value that the allelic ratio deviates from 0.5 calculated based on the binomial distribution, with the direction of bias indicated by an assigned positive or negative value (imprinted bias: Maternal +ve, Paternal –ve; strain bias: CAST +ve, FVB -ve). The allelic score cutoff was determined by the false discovery rate (FDR), which was set at 1% for all analysis in this study. That is, the allelic score cutoff was set at the level where the number of genes passing the cutoff in mock comparisons was 1% of that observed in the true comparisons, as described in detail in the Nucleic Acids Res paper. We now introduce the allelic score cutoff in the main text (subsection “The mouse gene expression Allelome shows tissue-specific variation”).), and describe in detail how it is defined in the Material and methods (subsection “Allelome.PRO analysis of RNA and ChIP-seq data”). In addition we have modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> to make it clearer to the readers how the Allelome.PRO pipeline works.</p><p>We classified X-linked genes as X chromosome inactivation (XCI) escapers if they did not show the expected CAST strain bias due to skewed XCI where the FVB allele was more frequently inactivated. In most cases XCI escapers were biallelic, and since the mean allelic ratio of X-linked genes was around 0.7 (0.735 in MEFs), many genes showing a consistent CAST bias would be classified as biallelic with a 0.7 allelic ratio cutoff (Andergassen et al., 2015). Therefore, as the reviewer notes, we chose a 0.6 allelic ratio cutoff for the XCI escaper analysis to be more conservative in classifying genes as biallelic and XCI escapers (subsection “Escape from X-inactivation is tissue-specific and correlates with increased distance from monoallelic enhancers”).</p><p> <italic>2) Their definition of bi-allelic expression (BAE) includes genes that have allelic expression ratios of less than 0.7 but also includes genes that are greater than 0.7 but are inconsistent between replicates – shouldn't this second category of genes be called ambiguous rather than biallelic and separated out?</italic> </p><p>In response to this comment we have analyzed the composition of biallelic genes, the results of which are shown in the new sub-figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> and referenced in the Results section (subsection “The mouse gene expression Allelome shows tissue-specific variation”). We found that depending on the tissue, between 40.4-57.0% biallelic genes showed a consistent strain bias where the median ratio of the replicates was below the allelic ratio cutoff. The remaining biallelic genes, which included genes with an imprinted bias below the allelic ratio cutoff, showed the direction of strain bias fluctuated between the replicates. Of these a minority, between 4.8-10.4% of total biallelic genes, showed an inconsistent bias with at least one replicate over the 0.7 allelic ratio cutoff. Biallelic genes are negatively defined as expressed genes that do not show a consistent strain bias or imprinted bias over the allelic ratio and allelic score cutoffs, therefore we believe it is appropriate to retain these genes in the biallelic category rather than creating an extra ambiguous category.</p><p> <italic>3) Near the start of the paper (Results section) the authors classify genes as strain-biased for either CAST of FVB – these are a different set of genes from the maternal and paternal allele-expressed genes that they also find. They use these sets of genes throughout the manuscript. In looking throughout the paper including the supplemental methods there appears to be no definition as to what the authors mean by strain-biased genes (or define the parameters used to call genes in this category).</italic> </p><p>Strain biased genes are those genes that show a consistent expression bias towards either the FVB or CAST allele in all replicates above the allelic score FDR cutoff and with a median allelic ratio above 0.7. This differs from genes that show an imprinted bias, where the bias towards the FVB or CAST allele switches depending on the strain of the parents and whether the gene shows a maternal or paternal bias. To further clarify the classification of strain biased genes we have expanded the explanation of the Allelome.PRO pipeline in the Material and methods (subsection “Allelome.PRO analysis of RNA and ChIP-seq data”) and modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> to show how each of the allelic categories are defined.</p><p> <italic>4) In their analysis of regulation of allele-specific genes the authors use the H3K27ac signal in a window of +/- 50 kb from the TSS of the target gene. They then use a procedure of computing the enrichment of allelic behavior of H3K27ac windows of 4kb in size compared to randomly shuffled windows. First, H3K27ac signal is localized to the TSS of an active gene, thus why is such a large window around the TSS needed – shouldn't it be localized no more than a kb from the TSS. Additionally, why perform the enrichment compared to a shuffled null? Can't one just compute the allelic signal of a genomic window centered on the TSS and compare the direction of the allelic bias (if there is one) with the target gene being regulated?</italic> </p><p>H3K27ac is enriched on active promoters and enhancers. The reviewer is correct that the H3K27ac bias around the TSS should follow the expression bias observed in RNA-seq, but in the analysis referred to here from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, we aimed to detect allelic biases in enhancers that may regulate strain biased expression. We chose a +/-50kb window around the TSS, because most enhancers regulate genes within this range (Sanyal et al., 2012), and excluded the region +/- 2kb from the TSS to remove promoter enriched H3K27ac from the analysis. It was necessary to compare the enrichment to shuffled windows to show that the associate that we saw was not random.</p><p> <italic>More technical issues:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) In subsection “Escape from X-inactivation is tissue-specific and correlates with increased distance from monoallelic enhancers” they compute the significance of the escapers being further from H3K27ac windows compared to non-escapers and quote a significance of p&lt;1e-20 and refer to the Material and methods. In the Material and methods however, the authors present the analysis for this claim and show that the significance using a Fisher's exact test is p&lt;1e-17.</italic> </p><p>The main text is now corrected to give the correct value, p&lt;10<sup>-17</sup> (paragraph three, subsection “Escape from X-inactivation is tissue-specific and correlates with increased distance from monoallelic enhancers”).</p><p> <italic>2) In both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and Figure 2—figure supplement 2C the use of similar colors such as green, blue and similar shades to correctly distinguish the features of the figures.</italic> </p><p>For most figures we used the color-code introduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to indicate the different allelic states that we classify, taking care to chose colors that could be easily distinguished from each other. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> to highlight XCI escapers on the Circos plot we made non-escaper genes partially transparent (CAST in embryonic and adult tissues, MAT in extra-embryonic tissues, we now state this in the figure legend). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> we show a heatmap with a gradient of color from strain biased CAST (brown) to biallelic (green) to FVB strain biased (turquoise), allowing the degree of allelic bias to be visualized. For both these figures we believe the variation on our standard color-code improves understanding of the data, and therefore would prefer to keep the color-code in these figures as they are.</p><p> <italic>3) While &quot;Allelome&quot; seems OK, the use of &quot;Escapome&quot; seems unnecessary and unhelpful.</italic></p><p>We have replaced the term “Escapome” in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
