The RNA methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 are components of a multisubunit m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex whose enzymatic activity is substantially higher than the activities of METTL3 or METTL14 alone. The molecular mechanism underpinning this synergistic effect is poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic core of the human m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex comprising METTL3 and METTL14. The structure reveals the heterodimeric architecture of the complex and donor substrate binding by METTL3. Structure-guided mutagenesis indicates that METTL3 is the catalytic subunit of the complex, whereas METTL14 has a degenerate active site and plays non-catalytic roles in maintaining complex integrity and substrate RNA binding. These studies illuminate the molecular mechanism and evolutionary history of eukaryotic m<sup>6</sup>A modification in post-transcriptional genome regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18434.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18434.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>methyltransferase</kwd><kwd>m6A</kwd><kwd>epitranscriptomics</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional gene regulation</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-StG-337284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Śledź</surname><given-names>Paweł</given-names></name><name><surname>Jinek</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006447</institution-id><institution>Universität Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Śledź</surname><given-names>Paweł</given-names></name><name><surname>Jinek</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of the catalytic core of the N6-methyladenosine RNA methyltransferase complex METTL3-METTL14 reveals that METTL3 is the catalytic subunit, while METTL14 plays non-catalytic roles in substrate recognition and in maintaining complex integrity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Methylation of the amino group at the N<sup>6</sup> position in adenine nucleobases (m<sup>6</sup>A) has emerged as a dynamic posttranscriptional RNA modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu and Pan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yue et al., 2015</xref>).

In mRNAs, the modification is typically found clustered around the stop codon and within 3’ untranslated regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>); the presence of m<sup>6</sup>A in 5’ untranslated regions has in turn been shown to promote 5’ cap-independent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A is implicated in controlling stem cell differentiation and embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geula et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>), the mammalian circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fustin et al., 2013</xref>), as well as in stress responses such as heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). The modification is reversible due to the interplay of methyltransferase (MTase) ‘writer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) and demethylase ‘eraser’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>) enzymes. Transcripts containing m<sup>6</sup>A marks are specifically recognized and regulated by ‘reader’ proteins, in particular members of the YTH domain family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stoilov et al., 2002</xref>). The cytoplasmic protein YTHDF2 specifically recognizes and destabilizes m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNAs by promoting their localization to processing (P-) bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>), while YTHDF1 stimulates mRNA translation by interactions with translation initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The nuclear YTHDC1 protein modulates pre-mRNA splicing by recruiting and modulating splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). Another m<sup>6</sup>A reader, HNRNPA2B1, has been shown to promote pri-microRNA processing through interactions with the Microprocessor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alarcón et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>The m<sup>6</sup>A RNA modification is catalyzed in the nucleus by a multiprotein writer complex containing the putative methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bokar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwartz et al., 2014</xref>). The two subunits interact directly with each other and further associate with Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ping et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwartz et al., 2014</xref>). WTAP does not have MTase activity but is required for efficient RNA methylation in vivo and for localization of METTL3 and METTL14 to nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ping et al., 2014</xref>). The m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from the donor substrate S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the adenine nucleobases in acceptor RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bokar et al., 1997</xref>). The complex preferentially modifies substrate RNAs conforming to the consensus sequence GGACU but otherwise appears to have little specificity for structural features in its RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Both METTL3 and METTL14 have been shown to have weak m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase activity in isolation. However, physical interaction between METTL3 and METTL14 results in substantially higher MTase activity than the sum of the activities of the individual methyltransferase subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Despite recent advances in understanding the biological roles of m<sup>6</sup>A modification, the molecular architecture of the m6A writer complex and its mechanism of RNA methylation are poorly understood. In particular, the molecular basis for the synergistic enhancement of MTase activity within the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex is unknown.</p><p>To shed light on the molecular mechanism of m<sup>6</sup>A RNA methylation, we determined crystal structures of the catalytic core of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex comprising METTL3 and METTL14 methyltransferase subunits. The structures reveal the molecular architecture of the complex and highlight specific features involved in complex assembly, substrate recognition and catalysis. Crucially, our structural and biochemical data imply that METTL3 is the sole catalytic subunit of the complex, while METTL14 plays non-catalytic roles in complex stabilization and substrate RNA recruitment. These findings advance our mechanistic understanding of the m<sup>6</sup>A modification in post-transcriptional genome regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification and structure determination of a minimal core m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex</title><p>The m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex contains two putative catalytic subunits - METTL3 and METTL14. Previous studies have shown that METTL3 and METTL14 physically interact with each other and that their association has a synergistic effect on the catalytic activity of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). To obtain structural insights into the molecular architecture and mechanism of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex, we sought to determine the crystal structure of the catalytic core of the complex comprising the two methyltransferase (MTase) subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To this end, we co-expressed human METTL3 and METTL14 in insect cells. The purified METTL3-METTL14 complex was catalytically active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) but failed to crystallize. Both METTL3 and METTL14 polypeptides contain a central MTA-70 methyltransferase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bujnicki et al., 2002</xref>). METTL3 additionally contains an N-terminal region harboring two putative CCCH zinc finger motifs, whereas in METTL14, the MTA-70 domain is flanked by N- and C-terminal extensions containing low-complexity sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iyer et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To identify protein constructs amenable to crystallization, the full-length METTL3-METTL14 complex was subjected to limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin and N-terminal sequencing. Based on these experiments, we engineered N- and C-terminally truncated forms of both METTL3 and METTL14, comprising residues 354–580 and 107–395, respectively. The MTase activity of the truncated METTL3-METTL14 dimer was reduced to background level, indicating that the terminal extensions are required for efficient substrate RNA binding or catalysis. Further experiments using complexes in which only METTL3 or METTL14 was truncated showed that the catalytic activity is contingent upon the presence of full-length METTL3, while the N- and C-terminal extensions flanking the central region comprising residues 107–395 in METTL14 are dispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The truncated METTL3-METTL14 complex was crystallized and its structure solved by a single-wavelength anomalous diffraction approach utilizing the anomalous signal of native sulfur atoms. Experimentally-phased electron density maps revealed the presence of a single molecule of the donor product S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), serendipitously co-purified with the complex, in the METTL3 active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). High-resolution native data were subsequently measured from a METTL3-METTL14 crystal grown in the presence of SAH and a short m<sup>6</sup>A-containing oligonucleotide. However, the RNA oligonucleotide was not evident in electron density maps. The final atomic model, containing a single METTL3-METTL14 dimer in the asymmetric unit, was refined at a resolution of 1.85 Å with an <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> of 19.0%, working <italic>R</italic> of 15.7%, and good stereochemistry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We additionally co-crystallized the METTL3-METTL14 core complex in the presence of the donor substrate S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using these crystals, a structure of the METTL3-METTL14 complex, in which the co-purified SAH product was exchanged by SAM, was determined at a resolution of 1.9 Å and refined to an <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>work</sub> values of 18.6% and 15.7%, respectively. No additional electron density attributable to SAM or SAH could be observed in the proximity of METTL14 in the two structures. Disulfide bridge formation was observed between Cys338<sup>METTL14</sup> and Cys388<sup>METTL14</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The MTase activity of the METTL3-14 complex has previously been reported to be sensitive to reducing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that disulfide bond formation could play a role in regulating the catalytic activity of the complex. However, substitution of Cys338<sup>METTL14</sup> with alanine had little impact on MTase activity, indicating that disulfide bond formation in METTL14 is not required for the function of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18434.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain composition and methyltransferase activity of METTL3-METTL14.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain composition of METTL3 and METTL14.

The METTL3 and METTL14 MTase domains dimerize through an extensive interface that buries 2055 Å<sup>2</sup> of solvent-accessible surface area per subunit. The symmetric part of the dimerization interface is formed by strands β4–5 and helix α4 of each MTase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and involves a network of hydrogen bonding interactions as well as hydrophobic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The hydrophobic region of the METT3-METTL14 interface, centered on strands β4–5, is capped by the side chain of Ile134<sup>METTL14</sup> from an N-terminal extension of METTL14 comprising residues Asn117-Asp136<sup>METTL14</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The METTL14 N-terminal extension, which lacks secondary structure except for a short alpha-helical motif (Tyr119-Thr126<sup>METTL14</sup>), breaks the overall pseudo-C2 symmetry of the heterodimer and shields the hydrophobic dimerization interface from solvent exposure. Of note, we were unable to express soluble METTL3-METTL14 complexes lacking the N-terminal METTL14 extension. Unlike METTL14, METTL3 lacks equivalent amino acid residues in the region upstream of the methyltransferase domain. Finally, the dimerization interaction is reinforced by two partially disordered loops, one from each subunit (residues Arg468-Lys480<sup>METTL3</sup> and Lys266-Arg283<sup>METTL14</sup>), that reach over and insert an aromatic residue (Trp475<sup>METTL3</sup> and Phe281<sup>METTL14</sup>, respectively) into a hydrophobic pocket in the other subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18434.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>METTL3 and METTL14 form an asymmetric dimer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall structure of METTL3-METTL14 heterodimer.

However, neither SAM nor SAH were observed to be bound to METTL14 in the METTL3-14 complex structures. Modeling a molecule of SAM in the METTL14 active site reveals that the binding would be precluded by steric clashes between the adenine moiety and the side chains of Trp211<sup>METTL14</sup> and Pro362<sup>METTL14</sup> in the absence of compensatory structural changes in METTL14. Moreover, METTL14 lacks residues that could form hydrogen-bonding contacts to the ribose hydroxyls in SAM, as residues Asn549<sup>METTL3</sup> and Gln550<sup>METTL3</sup> correspond to Pro362<sup>METTL14</sup> and Thr363<sup>METTL14</sup>, respectively. Additionally, the putative acceptor binding site in METTL14 is occluded by the side chains of Tyr198<sup>METTL14</sup>, Tyr199<sup>METTL14</sup> and Ile324<sup>METTL14</sup> projecting from loops corresponding to ASL1 and ASL2 in METTL3 (Glu192-Cys210<sup>METTL14</sup> and Pro319-Lys326<sup>METTL14</sup>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Collectively, these observations suggest that METTL14 contains a degenerate active site that is unable to accommodate donor and acceptor substrates, implying that METTL14 is catalytically inactive. To test this hypothesis, we targeted putative active site residues implicated in donor substrate binding and catalysis in METTL3 and METTL14 by site-directed mutagenesis, and assayed the methyltransferase activities of resulting complexes using an RNA oligonucleotide containing the consensus m<sup>6</sup>A methylation sequence GGACU.

With the acceptor adenine bound in the active site of METTL3, the ribose-phosphate backbone of the RNA substrate is placed over a positively charged groove located at the interface of the METTL3 and METTL14 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). This groove is highly evolutionarily conserved and comprises residues Arg465<sup>METTL3</sup>, Arg468<sup>METTL3</sup>, His474<sup>METTL3</sup>, His478<sup>METTL3</sup> and Arg245<sup>METTL14</sup>, Arg249<sup>METTL14</sup>, Arg254<sup>METTL14</sup> and Arg255<sup>METTL14</sup>. The last four residues form a positively charged pocket occupied by a co-crystallized acetate ion, possibly mimicking RNA phosphate group binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These observations suggest that this surface mediates substrate RNA binding and are in good agreement with the presence of bound donor substrate and product in the METTL3 active site and lack of catalytic activity in active site mutants of METTL3. In contrast, the corresponding surface adjacent to the putative active site in METTL14 on the opposite face of the METTL3-14 dimer lacks evolutionary conservation and is mostly negatively charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This argues against substrate RNA binding by this surface and further underscores the notion that METTL14 is catalytically inactive. To test the hypothesis that the positively charged groove adjacent to the METTL3 active site at the METT3-METTL14 dimer interface is involved in substrate RNA binding, we substituted Arg254<sup>METTL14</sup> with alanine and assayed the resulting complex for MTase activity.

When Arg255<sup>METTL14</sup> was additionally mutated to alanine, the catalytic activity of resulting R254A/R255A<sup>METTL14</sup> double mutant complex was reduced to background levels, further suggesting that these residues are involved in substrate RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We additionally tested the involvement of the amino acid residues in the putative acceptor binding pockets in METTL3 and METTL14.

Despite rapid progress in understanding the biological functions of m<sup>6</sup>A, there have been only limited mechanistic insights into the basic molecular machinery that installs this epitranscriptomic mark. In this study, we have defined the catalytic core of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex and determined the structure of its complexes with methyl group donor substrates and products. Our findings are in good agreement with other recent structural studies of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2016b</xref>). The molecular architecture of the METTL3-METTL14 dimer is strikingly similar to that of homodimeric bacterial N<sup>6</sup>-adenosine DNA methyltransferases such as EcoP15I. This hints at an evolutionary scenario in which the m6A writer enzyme emerged by the acquisition of a bacterial homodimeric DNA methyltransferase. Subsequent gene duplication and sequence divergence of the METTL3 and METTL14 subunits may have driven the specificity switch towards RNA.</p><p>The presence of an extensive interaction interface between METTL3 and METTL14 in the complex suggests that the two methyltransferase subunits form an obligate, constitutive heterodimer, implying that they are unlikely to be functional in isolation. Of note, we have not been able to express and purify soluble METTL14 in the absence of METTL3, suggesting that METTL3 is required to stabilize METTL14. Our observations are fully consistent with a recent genetic study showing that knockout of either METTL3 or METTL14 in mouse embryonic stem cells resulted in complete loss of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geula et al., 2015</xref>). Although both METTL3 and METTL14 have previously been reported to harbor weak m<sup>6</sup>A MTase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), our structural and biochemical data indicate that METTL3 is the sole catalytic subunit within the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex. Neither SAM nor SAH was observed to bind to METTL14 in the structures. Moreover, the putative active site in METTL14 is sterically blocked and lacks specific amino acid residues that would facilitate donor and acceptor substrate binding. Consistently, engineered mutations in the active site of METTL3 compromise the MTase activity of the complex, while corresponding mutations in METTL14 have little or no effect. These observations suggest that METTL14 is not catalytically active and likely has a twofold function in maintaining the integrity of the complex and in facilitating RNA substrate binding, explaining the synergistic effect of the METTL3-METTL14 interaction on enzymatic activity of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex.</p><p>Based on these results, we propose a model for substrate RNA recognition by the METTL3-METTL14 complex in which binding of the substrate RNA to a conserved, positively charged interface of the METTL3-METTL4 heterodimer positions the acceptor adenine moiety in the catalytic pocket of METTL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Consistent with the model, mutations of arginine residues at the METTL3-METTL14 interface substantially reduce the MTase activity of the complex. However, given that the truncated complex used for crystallographic analysis lacks catalytic activity in vitro compared to the complexes containing full-length METTL3, the N-terminal extension of METTL3 is also required for the MTase activity of the core m<sup>6</sup>A complex. It is tempting to speculate that the two N-terminal CCCH zinc finger motifs of METTL3 are essential for catalytic activity, perhaps by contributing to specific recognition of the consensus methylation sequence. Interestingly, despite the spatial proximity of the N-terminal extension of METTL14 to the active site of METTL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), additional sequences in the N-terminal low complexity region of METTL14 are dispensable for catalytic activity.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18434.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for RNA methylation by the METTL3-METTL14 complex.</title><p>Binding of the substrate RNA to a conserved positively charged surface on the asymmetric interface of the METTL3-METTL4 heterodimer positions the acceptor adenine moiety in the catalytic pocket of METTL3 located defined by ASL1 and ASL2 loops.

(2016b)</xref>, showing that the crystallized construct is not representative of the catalytically active complex and implicating the N-terminal region of METTL3 in substrate RNA recognition. Another structural analysis of the METTL3-METTL14 complex, published while this work was under revision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>), has corroborated our model and validated the requirement for the METTL3 zinc finger motifs for methyltransferase activity. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of substrate RNA recognition still awaits further structural and biochemical characterization. Moreover, the core m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex associates in vivo with additional components such as WTAP, whose functions are not fully understood. Defining the molecular architecture of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer holocomplex will therefore be a major goal of future structural studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>For biochemical assays, full-length human METTL3-METTL14 complex was prepared by coexpression using the Sf9 insect cell/baculovirus expression system. A two-cassette baculovirus shuttle vector was constructed from plasmid 5B (developed by Scott Gradia, UC Berkeley MacroLab, Addgene #30122) using ligation-independent cloning (LIC). METTL14 was expressed with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. METTL3 was fused to an N-terminal polypeptide sequence comprising a StrepII epitope tag (WSHPQFEK) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). This METTL14 fusion construct was generated by first inserting the METTL14 DNA sequence into the 438-RGFP vector (developed by Scott Gradia, UC Berkeley MacroLab, Addgene #55221) and then subcloning the fusion construct into the 5B baculovirus shuttle vector. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the Bac-to-Bac kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. For protein expression, suspension cultures of Sf9 cells in SF-4 Baculo Express medium (Amimed) were infected at a density of 2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> ml<sup>−1</sup>. Cells were harvested 72 hr post infection, resuspended in 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 5 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 0.4% Triton-X100, supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany), and lysed by sonication. The protein complex was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA matrix (Qiagen). The affinity tags were removed by digestion with TEV protease, followed by further purification by size exclusion chromatography using the Superdex-200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0 and 200 mM KCl. Protein samples were concentrated to 2–14 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Point mutants were generated in the baculovirus shuttle vectors using the QuikChange site-directed mutagesis protocol. Mutant proteins were expressed and as for the WT construct.</p><p>For crystallization, the truncated complex containing METTL3 (residues 354–580) and METTL14 (residues 107–395) was prepared by coexpression in Sf9 cells using the 5B baculovirus shuttle vector. In this case, METTL14 carried an N-terminal hexahistidine tag while METTL3 was expressed without an affinity tag. The truncated complex was expressed and purified as for full-length METTL3-METTL14. The sample was concentrated to 11 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The partially truncated complexes comprising full-length METTL3 and truncated METTL14 (residues 107–395), or truncated METTL3 (residues 354–580) and full-length METTL14, were prepared according to the same procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Limited proteolysis</title><p>The full length METTL3-METTL14 complex was diluted to 1.0 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> and incubated overnight at 4°C with chymotrypsin at a ratio of 100:1 (w/w). The resulting protein sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to size exclusion chromatography using the Superdex-200 column and 20 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl buffer. The fractions containing the truncated writer complex were pooled, concentrated and subjected to mass spectrometry and N-terminal Edman sequencing analysis at Functional Genomics Center Zurich.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Crystallization and structure determination</title><p>Purified METTL3<sup>354–580</sup>-METTL14<sup>106–396</sup> complex was diluted to 5 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> in 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl. Crystals were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 µl complex solution with 1 µl reservoir solution containing 100 mM sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, 100 mM Mg-acetate, 19% PEG 8000 (w/v). For data collection, crystals were cryoprotected by transfer to a solution containing 100 mM sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, 100 mM Mg acetate, 20% (w/v) PEG 8000, and 15% (v/v) glycerol, and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beam line X06DA (PXIII) of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland) and processed using XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kabsch, 2010</xref>). Data collection statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Native sulfur-SAD data comprised 11 data sets collected by exposing different parts of the same crystal, rotating the crystal through 360° in each data set and changing the kappa angle between datasets in 5° increments to ensure data completeness and redundancy. Sulfur sites were located using SHELXD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schneider and Sheldrick, 2002</xref>), and phases were calculated using SHELXE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sheldrick, 2008</xref>). The model was subsequently improved using the phenix.autobuild routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zwart et al., 2008</xref>), followed by several rounds of manual building in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) and refinement using phenix.refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2012</xref>). Crystals used for the high-resolution native dataset collection were grown in the presence 0.5 mM SAH and 1 mM RNA oligonucleotide (CUGG-m<sup>6</sup>A-CUAA) or with 5 mM SAM, respectively, from 18–22% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 300 mM Mg-acetate. Substrate-bound structures were determined by molecular replacement using the Phaser module of the Phenix package. Model building and refinement was carried out using COOT and phenix.refine.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Methyltransferase activity assays</title><p>Methyltransferase activities of wild-type and mutant METTL3-METTL14 complexes were measured using an antibody-based assay. Assay conditions were derived from a previously reported radioactivity-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2016</xref>) and modified to ensure optimal turnover within the timescale of the assay. Reactions mixtures contained 200 nM 3’-biotinylated RNA substrate (5’-UACACUCGAUCUGGACUAAGCUGCUC-3’) and 1 μM S-adenosyl methionine in 20 mM Tris buffer at pH 8.0. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 nM protein and incubated at 37°C for 180 min. To detect the production of methylated RNA, reaction mixtures were transferred to the 96-well neutravidin coated plates (Pierce) and incubated for 60 min at 4°C. Following extensive washing and blocking, the plate was incubated first with a m<sup>6</sup>A-specific primary antibody (Abcam ab151230, used at 1:400 dilution), and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, A6154, used at 1:5000 dilution). m<sup>6</sup>A antibody binding was quantified by measuring the conversion of a colorimetric substrate 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, supplied as BM Blue POD substrate by Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) at a wavelength of 390 nm. Reactions lacking the SAM cofactor were performed to measure the background signal for each enzyme construct due to non-specific antibody binding.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Meitian Wang, Vincent Olieric and Takashi Tomizaki at the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland) for assistance with X-ray diffraction measurements, and to Serge Chesnov and René Brunisholz (Functional Genomics Center Zurich) for assistance with mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing.

The authors establish that Mettl3-Mettl14 hetero-complex forms an asymmetric dimer, with a central RNA binding fold.

The Introduction is accurate and informative, references are balanced throughout the manuscript. The figures are elegant and clear. All conclusions made are fully supported by the experimental data.</p><p>I only have minor non-experimental revisions suggestions for the authors:</p><p>1) Only less than two weeks ago, Wang et al. Nature 2016 published a similar study and reached identical conclusions. Considering the very recent publication, I do not find that the novelty of the current study is compromised.

The latter occurs despite the presence of Mettl14 upon ablation of Mettl3 protein and vice versa. This genetic result is consistent with conclusions made based on the structural and biochemical in vitro analysis conducted herein, and that both proteins are required for maintaining basal m<sup>6</sup>A deposition by this complex. This should be clearly indicated and discussed in detail.</p><p>3) At the end of the Discussion, the authors should indicate that also conducting structural analysis for the larger complex containing either WDDR5, and/or KIAA1429 might be of major importance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper by Sledz and Jinek describes the crystal structure of a truncated and inactive form of human METTL3-METTL14 methyltransferase complex, which is responsible in the methylation of adenosine at N6 position (m<sup>6</sup>A) on mRNAs. This is a very interesting field and many high-impact studies have focused on this m<sup>6</sup>A post-transcriptional modification, showing that this dynamic modification affects mRNA fates such as splicing, translation and decay. This modification also influences stem cell differentiation, circadian clock and embryonic development.</p><p>Beyond describing the crystal structure of this heterodimeric methyltransferase, the authors show that although both proteins are structurally related to SAM-dependent methyltransferases, only METTL3 binds SAM and is then the catalytic subunit of this holoenzyme, contrary to previously published data. They also identify regions from METTL14, which are essential for enzymatic activity. By comparing their structure to those of DNA m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase bound to DNA, they propose that METTL14 contributes to mRNA recognition. This article describes a very nice piece of data on a highly interesting complex. This work is technically of great quality and the results are of interests.</p><p>The main concern about this work is that as mentioned in the manuscript, the crystal structure of the same human METTL3-METTL14 complex has just been published in Nature (Wang et al; Nature; 2016). As the boundaries of the crystallized complex are quite similar to those used in the Nature's study, the current structure does not bring much additional information. One aspect, which could be interesting, would be to compare these structures as these complexes did not crystallized in the same space group. Hence, some interesting differences might exist. Similarly, the biochemical data presented in this manuscript do not bring much novelty compared to those presented in the Nature's paper.</p><p>In conclusion, this work would have been very interesting but as another group recently published similar structure, there is no more novelty.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>m<sup>6</sup>A methylation of adenosine is a prevalent and reversible modification found in eukaryotic messenger RNA and long non-coding RNAs. This modification is not only important for its role in regulation of stability, translation and processing of cellular transcripts but is also vital for stem cell differentiation and embryonic development. Its regulatory role is also signified by the discovery of demethylases that reverses this reaction. The forward reaction for m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is catalyzed by a complex composed of two proteins METTL3 and METTL14, which are actively under investigation in recent years. In this manuscript, the authors obtained high resolution crystal structures of a minimal domain constructs of METTL3-METTL14 complex in the presence of the methyl donor substrate (SAM) and the product (SAH). In essence, the structure shows that METTL3 -METTL14 forms a stable complex with extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. The authors also point out that, although the catalytic site resides in the METTL3, the full length METLL14 is also an essential component for the catalytic activity. They also verified this observation by showing a structure superposition of METTL3-METTL14 complex with the structure of DNA methyltransferase EcoP15I bound to substrate DsDNA. The model suggests that the substrate RNA binds to a conserved positively charged interface of METTL3-METTL14 complex while positioning the acceptor adenine moiety in the catalytic pocket of METTL3.This observation was further investigated by point mutation at the proposed binding surface responsible for the RNA binding.</p><p>Technical aspects:</p><p>The paper is clearly written and appropriately referenced. The data statistics for the crystal structures are appropriate and refined well. However, the quality of figures needs to be improved before the final publication. For example,</p><p>1) The secondary structure motifs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> should be labelled. The color code for SAM and SAH in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> should be changed. This reviewer could hardly see any difference between the color of Carbon and Sulphur (6A, 6B). I propose to apply the same color coding for SAH and SAM in all three figures.</p><p>2) In the sequence alignment, please use the real residue numbers rather than the scaling numbers. Also, mark and write the details of the active site residues of METTL3 and METTL4 and also give a description in the footnote. No need to show a consensus sequence of alignment.</p><p>Originality and significance:</p><p>The crystal structure of METTL3-METTL14 is undoubtedly of broad interest considering the central role of the METTL3-METTL14 complex in mRNA methylation that leads to cellular regulation and human disease and deserves publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Moreover, the authors contradict the previous reports of presence of activity in the isolated METTL3 and METTL14 subunits. This lack of activity is also explained convincingly by the crystal structure of the complex. METTL3 has been shown to be the catalytic subunit while METTL14 has been shown to be mainly important for RNA recognition and binding. However, it is worth noting that the current work is very similar to the work recently been published by Wang et al. (Nature 2016), which dilutes the uniqueness of the current work. Therefore, I would leave it to the editor's discretion whether the work is deemed novel enough for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The content of the current paper in its present form could be improved to answer a few outstanding questions previously not touched by Wang et al. (see below).</p><p>A) One of the conclusions of the manuscript is that the MTase activity of the complex requires the full length METTL14 and at least the catalytic domain of METTL3. This is because the construct METTL14 107-395 does not show any activity when complexed with either the full length or catalytic domain of METTL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, to pin point the important region of METTL14 for the MTase activity, a few more plausible constructs should be designed. I propose to perform activity measurements of METTL3 (356-580) complexed with two more METTL14 constructs lacking either the C-terminal (res 1-395) or the N-terminal region (res 107-456). This could further reveal the substrate recognition and binding regions of the complex. Furthermore, a possible substrate recognition site (that detect the consensus sequence in RNA) should be referred to in Figure 10.</p><p>B) The author showed that point mutation of R254A (in METTL14) decreases the MTase activity by around 50 percent (Figure 9F). In my opinion, this is not enough to confirm the RNA binding surface. I would propose to map the binding surface by performing more mutations at the single and at the combination of various interface residues that would probably show background level activity. Other option is to perform EMSA experiment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18434.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>As you will see all thought that the work was very high quality and was in principle suitable for eLife.

As suggested by the reviewer and the Reviewing Editor, we have compared our structure with the structure published by Ping Yin and colleagues (Wang et al., 2016b) as well as the Molecular Cell paper by Yunsum Nam and colleagues (Wang et al., 2016a) in the manuscript. We discuss the differences in the Results section (subsection “METTL3 and METTL14 form a pseudosymmetric dimer”, second paragraph) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>Technical aspects:</italic> </p><p><italic>The paper is clearly written and appropriately referenced.

We have also labeled specific amino acid residues involved in donor or acceptor substrate binding and highlight the active site loops. We have included a more detailed description of the alignment in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>Originality and significance:</italic></p><p><italic>The crystal structure of METTL3-METTL14 is undoubtedly of broad interest considering the central role of the METTL3-METTL14 complex in mRNA methylation that leads to cellular regulation and human disease and deserves publication in eLife. Moreover, the authors contradict the previous reports of presence of activity in the isolated METTL3 and METTL14 subunits. This lack of activity is also explained convincingly by the crystal structure of the complex. METTL3 has been shown to be the catalytic subunit while METTL14 has been shown to be mainly important for RNA recognition and binding. However, it is worth noting that the current work is very similar to the work recently been published by Wang et al. (Nature 2016), which dilutes the uniqueness of the current work. Therefore, I would leave it to the editor's discretion whether the work is deemed novel enough for publication in eLife.</italic> </p><p><italic>The content of the current paper in its present form could be improved to answer a few outstanding questions previously not touched by Wang et al. (see below).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the critical assessment of our work.</p><p><italic>A) One of the conclusions of the manuscript is that the MTase activity of the complex requires the full length METTL14 and at least the catalytic domain of METTL3. This is because the construct METTL14 107-395 does not show any activity when complexed with either the full length or catalytic domain of METTL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, to pin point the important region of METTL14 for the MTase activity, a few more plausible constructs should be designed. I propose to perform activity measurements of METTL3 (356-580) complexed with two more METTL14 constructs lacking either the C-terminal (res 1-395) or the N-terminal region (res 107-456). This could further reveal the substrate recognition and binding regions of the complex. Furthermore, a possible substrate recognition site (that detect the consensus sequence in RNA) should be referred to in Figure 10.</italic> </p><p>We have revisited the catalytic activities of the truncated constructs of the METTL3-METTL14 complex. We discovered that our samples METTL3(354-580)–METTL14(2-456) and METTL3(2-580)–METTL14(107-395), which had been purified in parallel, had got accidentally swapped post purification.</p><p>As a result, the lack of catalytic activity shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> corresponds to the METTL3(354-580)–METTL14(2-456), i.e. the sample in which METTL3 lacks its N-terminal region. This indicates that the N-terminal region containing the two putative zing finger motifs is required for the catalytic activity of the complex, rather than the N- and C-terminal extensions in METTL14, as we previously stated in the original version of the manuscript. We are deeply sorry for this error and apologize for the confusion that we have caused.</p><p>Our data now suggests that the N-terminal zinc finger motifs in METTL3 contribute to substrate recognition, possibly by providing sequence specific recognition of the methylation consensus sequence. Based on these results, we have revised our model for the molecular mechanism of the METTL3-METTL14 complex (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our data is fully consistent with the structural and biochemical study of METTL3-METTL14 by Yunsum Nam and colleagues (Wang et al., 2016a), published in Molecular Cell last week, which arrived at the same conclusion.</p><p><italic>B) The author showed that point mutation of R254A (in METTL14) decreases the MTase activity by around 50 percent (Figure 9F). In my opinion, this is not enough to confirm the RNA binding surface. I would propose to map the binding surface by performing more mutations at the single and at the combination of various interface residues that would probably show background level activity. Other option is to perform EMSA experiment.</italic> </p><p>In addition to testing the R254A mutation in METTL14, we have now also tested the R254A/R255A double mutant. The activity of the METTL3-METTL14 complex containing this double mutation was reduced to background level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), strongly suggesting that these residues are involved in substrate RNA binding.</p></body></sub-article></article>
