<title>Background</title>
<p>Xenotransplantation is a promising approach to circumventing the current organ shortage. However, T-cell-dependent anti-xenoresponses are a major challenge to successful xenografts. Given the advantages of the use of CTLA4-Ig in the survival of allografts, the purpose of the study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of CTLA4-IgG4 modified immature dendritic cells (imDCs) in the prevention of islets xenograft rejection.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>CTLA4-IgG4 was constructed by the fusion of the extracellular regions of porcine CTLA4 to human the hIgG4 Fc region. The imDCs were induced and cultured from porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The CTLA4-IgG4 modified imDCs were delivered via the portal vein to the liver of diabetic mice (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) before islet xenografting, and mCTLA4-Ig was administered intravenously after xenotransplantation.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The xenograft survival of mice receiving unmodified imDCs was approximately 30 days. However, following administration of CTLA4-IgG4 modified imDCs before grafting and mCTLA4-Ig after grafting, xenografts survived for more than 100 days. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg population was increased in spleens. The efficacy of donor CTLA4-IgG4 modified imDCs correlated partially with the amplification of Tregs.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These results confirm that selective inhibition of the direct and indirect pathways of T-cell activation by donor CTLA4-IgG4 modified imDCs and receptor CTLA4-Ig is a highly effective strategy to promote survival of xenografts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Xenotransplantation is a promising approach to circumvent the current organ shortage. Specifically, pig has been considered the most suitable xenogeneic source for clinical islet transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Cardona1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Pierson1">[4]</xref>. Hyperacute rejection, however, is the greatest barrier to successful xenotransplantation in humans following this strategy, which substantially jeopardizes the xenograft survival. To address this, alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase-knockout pigs were generated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Phelps1">[5]</xref> and with the knockout pigs as the xenogeneic source, prolonged xenograft survival was observed in non-human primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Ekser1">[6]</xref>. Since evidence showed that the predominant epitope Gal(1–3) is expressed on pig endothelial cells with little expression on pig islets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Rayat1">[7]</xref>, this suggests that porcine islets may not undergo hyperacute rejection. However, the cell-mediated xenogeneic immune response is still a major challenge to successful xenotransplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Pierson1">[4]</xref>. Koulmanda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Koulmanda1">[8]</xref> reported that xenografts were rejected within 7 to 14 days of fetal porcine islet transplantation in mice. Xenograft survival was prolonged to 35 days in the class II-, CD4<sup>+</sup> mice. Moreover, islet survival reached approximately100 days in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-depleted mice. These results suggested that cell-mediated xenogeneic immune responses plays a central role in successful xenotransplantation of porcine islets either by the direct pathway comprising donor antigen presenting cell (APC)-dependent responses or by the indirect pathway comprising host APC-dependent responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Mirenda1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial regulators of immunity with their ability to induce and maintain allogeneic tolerance. It is now well-recognized that immature, ‘alternatively activated’, genetically modified, maturation-resistant DCs of either donor or host origin, can promote allograft survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Morelli1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Ezzelarab1">[11]</xref>. However, some DC subtypes in a tolerogenic state are unstable. In steady-state gene-modified DCs, some regulatory molecules, including IL-10, TNF-α, PD-1L, CTLA-4 and heme oxygenase-1 have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Lutz1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Jung1">[16]</xref>. Moreover, it has been reported that CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T-cell responses can also be terminated when cognate antigen is transgenically expressed in steady-state DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Nasreen1">[17]</xref> or by a combination of blocking co-stimulatory molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Xia1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>CTLA4-Ig has been extensively used to facilitate immune tolerance in allotransplants by inhibition of CD80/CD86-CD28 co-stimulatory interactions, which block T-cell activation. CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to be important in the maintenance of tolerance, especially transplantation tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Wood1">[19]</xref>. Several studies have shown that CD80/CD86-CD28 co-stimulatory signals, DCs, and TGF-β are necessary for the generation of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Tregs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Stockis1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Sucher1">[22]</xref>. Accordingly, by blocking the CD80/CD86-CD28 co-stimulatory interaction, CTLA4-Ig may inhibit CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg generation. Nevertheless, the effects of a fusion protein comprising CTLA4 and the IgG4 Fc fragment on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Tregs are poorly understood. It was anticipated that CTLA4-IgG4 is likely to improve the long-term survival of xenografts due to the long half-life in the blood and the inactivation of the classical complement pathway by the IgG4 Fc fragment.</p>
<p>In this study, we hypothesize that, by pre-treating gene-modified donor imDCs with a pCTLA4-IgG4 fusion protein, recipients receiving gene-modified imDC injection will exhibit effective suppression of T-cell activation via the direct pathway with little suppression of the indirect pathway following islet xenotransplantation.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>PCR and Constructs Preparation</title>
<p>Total RNA of porcine CTLA4 (pCTLA4) and hIgG4 Fc were isolated from pig and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), respectively, using E.Z.N.ATM Total RNA Kit I (OMEGA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR was performed over 35 cycles with each cycle comprising 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, extension at 72°C for 2 min and a further 7 min at 72°C. The pCTLA4 and the Hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains of the human IgG4 Fc fragment were amplified using primers based on the GenBank sequences (accession No. AF220248 and X70421). Primer sequences were as follows:</p>
<p>pCTLA4 Forward primer:5′-GATGTCGACAGCCATGGCTTGCTCTGGA-3′; Reverse primer:5′-GCAGAGATCTATTGATGGGAATAAAATAAGGCT-3′;</p>
<p>IgG4 Fc Forward primer:5′-GAGTCGACAGATCTGAATTCGAGTCCAAATCTTGTGACAAA-3′;</p>
<p>Reverse primer:5′-CGCTCGAGTCATTTACCCGGAGACAGGGA-3′.</p>
<p>The extracellular regions of pCTLA4 were PCR-amplified using pCTLA4 as a template. The same forward primer (pCTLA4) was used as for the full-length sequence. The reverse primer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Vaughan1">[23]</xref> was designed according to the 33 bases coding 11 amino acids immediately adjacent to the transmembrane region and the linked 15 bases coding a flexible linker of the regions. (:5′-CGGTTCGAATTCACCACCGGAGCCACCATCAGAATCTGGGCATGGTTCTGGATCAATGAC-3′). The 510 bp amplified product was fused to the hIgG4 regions with subcloning. The pCTLA4-IgG4 was further sub-cloned into the pShuttle-IRES-hrGFP-1 expressing vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA) (pShuttle-GFP-pCTLA4-IgG4).</p>
<p>Adv-pCTLA4-IgG4 was constructed using the AdEasyTM XL Adenoviral Vector System according to information recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA), and amplified using 293A cells (Baili, Shanghai,China ). Then titrated using Adeno-XTM Rapid Titer kit (Clontech), Virus titer was estimated at approximately 1×10<sup>12</sup> pfu/mL by fluorescence quantitative PCR,and the stock were stored at −80°C.</p>

<title>Cells and Cell Culture</title>
<p>Porcine monocyte-derived DCs were prepared as described in preliminary studies previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Tian1">[24]</xref>. CD172a is expressed on many monocytic and granulocytic cells quite early during their differentiation. The co-expression of CD172a and CD1 combined with relatively high levels of both CD80/86 and MHC class II represent phenotypic characteristics of porcine Mo-DC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Summerfield1">[25]</xref>. Briefly, porcine PBMCs were isolated by density centrifugation (2000 r/min, 20 min) over Ficoll/Hypaque Lymphoprep(GBD,USA). Cells were washed with RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and adjusted to 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L before being added to 6-well plates (3 mL/well) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 3 h. Non-adherent cells (more than 97% of T cells) were discarded leaving the adherent monocytes, which were maintained in fetal calf serum (FCS) supplemented with recombinant porcine IL-4 (20 ng/mL) and recombinant porcine GM-CSF (30 ng/mL) (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). Half of the culture medium was replaced with the fresh medium every 48 h. Phenotypic analysis of non-adherent cells was performed by flow cytometric analysis (FACS Calibur flow cytometer) using the following antibodies: monoclonal anti-CD172a (74-22-15;Vmrd, WA, USA), monoclonal (1053h2-18-1; BD Biosciences, USA) against SLA-DR, monoclonal antibodies Foxp3 Staining Set (BD Biosciences, USA) against CD4, CD25 and Foxp3, monoclonal antibody FITC-human CD152-Ig (Ancell Corporation, Bayport, USA) ) against CD80/CD86, and FITC-goat anti-mouse IgG (Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology, China).</p>

<title>pCTLA4-IgG4 Gene-modified Porcine imDCs</title>
<p>The porcine CTLA4-IgG4 adenoviral expression vector (Adv-pCTLA4-IgG4) and the control adenoviral vector (Adv-GFP) were used to transduce porcine imDCs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 500∶1 at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubation for 24 h. Cells were then gently washed and maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Samples of imDCs were identified based on the expression of pCTLA4-IgG4 and Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) by RT-PCR and Western blotting.</p>

<title>Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR)</title>
<p>Mouse splenocytes were harvested to isolate mononuclear cells as responders.

Responder cells (100 µl at 1×10<sup>7</sup>/mL) and mitomycin C pretreated stimulator cells (100 µl at 1×10<sup>6</sup>/mL) were seeded into 96-well plates followed by incubation at 37°C for 72 h. Simultaneously, L-tryptophan (250 µmol/L), an inhibitor of IDO, was added to another four groups of stimulator cells and responder cells. Cell proliferation was assessed by measurement of absorbance at 490 nm (A<sub>490</sub>) using a microtiter plate reader following the addition of MTS tetrazolium compound (Promega Corporation, USA) for 4 h.

<p>Flow cytometric analysis of several surface markers was conducted to further distinguish the different Mo-DCs at days 5 and 9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069640.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The results showed that, in comparison to the cells at day 5, at day 9 more cells expressed surface markers including, SLA-DR (52.32% vs. 68.09%), CD172a (54.67% vs. 82.27%) and CD80/CD86 (15.67% vs. 88.89%). These data suggested that the day 5 population contained more immature DCs (imDCs) than that at day 9. Therefore, day 5 cells (imDCs) were used in subsequent experiments.</p>

<title>pCTLA4-IgG4 Modified imDCs and MLR</title>
<p>The Adv-pCTLA4-IgG4 (MOI: 0, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000) was transfected into the porcine imDCs. GFP expression was investigated by fluorescence microscopy at 48 h post-infection. The efficiencies of porcine imDCs transduction with Adv-pCTLA4-Ig was approximately 60% at MOI 200 and 90% at MOI 500. However, at MOI 1,000, the original morphology of the cells disappeared and cell-death was observed in the majority of cells. These data indicated that a MOI of 500 was optimal.</p>
<p>Flow cytometry analysis showed that transfected imDCs still maintained an immature phenotype as evidenced by the low levels of cell surface markers, CD80/CD86 (14.52%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069640.s003">Figure S3</xref>). pCTLA4-IgG4 and IDO expression in the transfected imDCs were detected by RT-PCR and Western Bolt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069640.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>However, overexpression of pCTLA4-IgG4 significantly decreased the SI analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069640.s005">Figure S5</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). Among the cell groups, the lowest SI was observed at 48 h post-transfection, suggesting that pCTLA4-IgG4 mediated the greatest inhibition at this time-point. In contrast, addition of the IDO inhibitor, L-tryptophan, reversed the inhibition mediated by pCTLA4-IgG4, indicating that the overexpression of pCTLA4-IgG4 regulates IDO expression, which subsequently inhibits imDC proliferation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With CD4<sup>+</sup> cells as the main effector cells, the major obstacle to successful islet xenotransplantation is the T-cell mediated immune response. For example, porcine skin xenografts in splenectomized mice were always rejected in a T-cell-dependent fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Tesar1">[32]</xref>. CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated xenotransplantation resistance involves two distinct pathways: the direct pathway involving donor antigen presenting cell (APC)-dependent responses and the indirect pathway involving host APC-dependent responses. It has been shown in vitro that the direct pathway plays an important role in the initiation of primary T-cell responses to xenografts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Rossini1">[33]</xref>, while several in vivo studies have demonstrated that the indirect pathway also plays a role in xenograft rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Koulmanda2">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Singh1">[37]</xref>. However, the precise mechanisms of immune regulation of xenograft transplantation in vivo remain unclear.</p>
<p>Exogenous CTLA4-Ig gene transfer has been demonstrated to induce immune tolerance in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Graves1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Yang1">[39]</xref>, with multiple factors contributing to the overall function of CTLA4 in transplant immune modulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Rudd1">[40]</xref>. First, it was demonstrated that CTLA-4 reduces the contact between T cells and APCs and leads to a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Schneider1">[41]</xref>. Second, CTLA-4 prevents T-cell activation by competitive binding with CD80/CD86 molecules on the APCs with a binding affinity 100 times greater than that of CD28 for CD80/CD86 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Ellis1">[42]</xref>. Although Vaughan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Vaughan1">[23]</xref> showed that both pCTLA4-Ig and hCTLA4-Ig is capable of blocking human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation, the binding affinity of pCTLA4-Ig to human CD80/CD86 is low and pCTLA4-Ig fails to inhibit human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses co-stimulated by human B7, suggesting that pCTLA4-Ig may be effective in inhibiting the direct pathway in xenotransplantation. Lastly, CTLA4 induces DCs to express indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan, an essential stimulus for effector T-cell apoptosis in a tryptophan-deprived environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Thomson1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Lob1">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>In pilot studies of the overexpression of pCTLA4-IgG4 (Fc) fusion protein, MLRs revealed that the inhibition of proliferation of xenogeneic splenocytes was more efficient in the pCTLA4-IgG4 gene-modified imDCs group than that in unmodified imDCs group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Tian1">[24]</xref>. Others have shown that the survival of donor-derived (porcine) CTLA4-IgG4 gene-modified porcine islet xenografts was significantly prolonged in rats with diabetes. Additionally, we found that the level of IFN-γ decreased and IL-4 increased in the pCTLA4-IgG4 gene-modified porcine islet xenograft group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Tian2">[29]</xref>. It can be speculated that the pCTLA-IgG4 fusion protein blocks the direct pathway of recipient T-cell priming, which eventually induces the differentiation bias of T helper (Th) cells, which might be responsible for the significant prolongation of xenograft survival. Taken together, these results suggest that overexpression of the pCTLA4-IgG4 fusion protein is a feasible strategy to improve the success of xenograft survival.</p>
<p>In this study, we showed that islet xenograft survival in the control group without pCTLA4-IgG4 overexpression was only about 7 days. In contrast, xenograft survival following pre-infusion of donor unmodified imDCs was prolonged to more than 30 days. Xenograft survival following pre-infusion of donor pCTLA4-IgG4 modified imDCs was significantly prolonged to more than 60 days. Furthermore, the xenograft survival in mice treated with a pre-infusion of pCTLA4-IgG4 modified imDCs before grafting and mCTLA4-Ig injected late after grafting was more than 100 days. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis showed that the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg population in the spleen was increased in the pCTLA4-IgG4 modified imDCs group. It is possible that pCTLA4-IgG4 modified imDCs expressed pCTLA4-Ig which may be effective in inhibiting direct the pathway of CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cell activation in islet xenotransplantation. Another possibility may be that the pCTLA4-IgG4 modified imDCs, known as tolerogenic DCs, which expressed IDO, subsequently induced effector T-cell apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Lob1">[44]</xref>. Moreover, another potentially important aspect is that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>Treg cell differentiation and/or expansion is promoted in the recipient pretreated with pCTLA4-IgG4 modified imDCs. Many studies have confirmed the ability of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells to prevent the rejection of xenogeneic grafts in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Lin1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Nishimura1">[46]</xref>. Activated Treg cells may also down-regulate CD80/CD86 expression on host APCs, leading to the inhibition of cytokine production by DCs or IDO expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Grohmann1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Robert1">[49]</xref>. The current study implies that synergistic cross-linked interplay of pCTLA4-IgG4-modified-imDC and Tregs may play a critical role in transplantation tolerance. Recently, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was identified as a marker of (T-cell mediated) injury as well as an indicator of beneficial effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Robert2">[50]</xref>. Therefore, further investigations will be required to determine the efficacy of tolerance induction using donor-specific transfusions and co-stimulation blockade in xenotransplantation, especially since there could be a difference in efficacy among low and high HO-1 expressing recipients.</p>
<p>In summary, our studies have demonstrated that pCTLA4-IgG4 modified donor imDCs significantly prolong the survival of islet xenografts. It is hypothesized that the underlying mechanisms of this effect involve efficient blockade of the direct pathway by direct binding of pCTLA4-IgG4 to porcine CD80/CD86 molecules on donor APCs, and induction of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>Treg cell proliferation. The local regulatory mechanisms of tolerogenic DC-Treg interactions may lead to anti-xenograft T-cell responses. Furthermore, the indirect pathway of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation is also critical in xenograft rejection. After taking into account preferential binding of the porcine and murine CTLA4-Ig to species-matched B7 molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069640-Mirenda1">[9]</xref>, pCTLA4-IgG4 gene-modified donor imDCs combined with murine CTLA4-Ig blocked both the direct and indirect pathways and led to long-term xenograft survival. These results confirm that independent and selective inhibition of direct and indirect T-cell responses to porcine islet xenografts is a highly effective strategy for improving xenograft survival.</p>
