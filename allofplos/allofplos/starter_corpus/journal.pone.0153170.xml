<title>Background</title>
<p>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> transitional immature B-lymphocytes have been demonstrated to play an important role in regulating the alloimmune response in transplant recipients. Here, we analyzed the effect of calcineurin inhibition on these peripherally circulating regulatory B-cells (Breg) in renal transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine A (CsA) or tacrolimus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>PBMCs from healthy subjects (HS) (n = 16) and renal transplant recipients (n = 46) were isolated. Flow cytometry was performed for CD19, CD24, CD38 and IL-10 either after isolation or after 72 hours of co-culture in presence of PMA/Ionomycin and TLR9-ligand in presence or absence of increasing concentrations of tacrolimus or CsA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The amount of CD19<sup>+</sup> B-cells among lymphocytes was ∼9.1% in HS, ∼3.6% in CsA (n = 11, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and ∼6.4% in TAC (n = 35, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) treated patients. Among B-cells, a distinct subset of Breg was found to be 4.7% in HS, 1.4% in tacrolimus treated patients and almost blunted in patients receiving CsA. Similarily, ∼4% of B-cells in HS and even fewer in CsA or tacrolimus treated patients produced IL-10 (0.5% and 1.5%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and this was confirmed both in non-transplanted CsA-treated healthy subjects and in <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture experiments. Among 29 patients with &lt;1% of Breg, 9 cases (31%) displayed an allograft rejection in contrast to only one case of rejection (6%) among 17 patients with &gt;1%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Calcineurin inhibitors reduce number and IL-10 production of Bregs in the peripheral circulation of both renal transplant recipients and non-transplanted healthy subjects. CNI induced Breg reduction is not restricted to a solid organ transplant setting and is not mediated by co-medication with steroids or MPA. A low proportion of Breg cells is associated with an elevated frequency of allograft rejection events.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>B-cells shape the humoral immunity and are classically considered to amplify the immune response because of their capability to produce antibodies (including autoantibodies) as well as acting as antigen-presenting cells to modulate T-cell-mediated immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref002">2</xref>]. After solid organ transplantation, the production of donor-specific allo-antibodies (DSA) is involved in both acute and chronic allograft rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref004">4</xref>]. By contrast, immature subsets of B-cells termed regulatory B-cells have recently been shown in mice and humans to mediate protective immune responses by producing regulatory cytokines such as IL-10, TGF-b, IL-35 and directly interacting with pathogenic T-cells via cell-to-cell contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref009">9</xref>]. The Breg cell population appears to be heterogenous as different murine B-cell subsets such as CD1d<sup>hi</sup>CD5<sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref010">10</xref>] and Tim-1<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>+</sup> B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref012">12</xref>] have been described to exert immunoregulatory function. In humans, the identification of B-cells with regulatory properties has first been demonstrated in several studies in allergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref013">13</xref>] and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref014">14</xref>] or gianT-cell arteritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref015">15</xref>]. An exact definition of human Breg cells by lineage-specific surface markers is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref016">16</xref>]. Studies in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis or type 1 diabetes demonstrated that <italic>ex vivo</italic>-activated B-cells produced less IL-10 than B-cells from healthy subjects, suggesting that insufficient IL-10 secretion by B-cells might facilitate autoimmune pathogenesis in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref018">18</xref>]. A widely accepted phenotypic characterization of Bregs in humans was suggested by Blair et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref014">14</xref>]. In their studies, the immature transitional CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> B-cell subset was shown to enrich for IL-10+ Bregs and these cells suppressed CD3-mediated activation and differentation of Th1-cells via both secretion of IL-10 and cell-cell interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref014">14</xref>]. In addition, Tedder and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref019">19</xref>] identified a CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> memory B-cell subset harboring a similar number of IL-10 producing cells that have been identfied to inhibit TNFα production of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th-cells and monocytes.</p>
<p>In transplant immunology, recent findings from both experimental murine models and human studies pointed out that distinct B-cell subsets exert an immunoregulatory activity and may both participate in maintaining long-term allograft function and contribute in preventing allograft rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref020">20</xref>]. This is a rather surprising finding because the presence of donor-specific allo-antibodies in transplant recipients is often associated with a decreased allograft function. Recent microarray analysis and Real Time PCR studies in operational tolerant allograft recipients (stable allograft function one year after withdrawal of immunosuppression) identified a B-cell specific gene signature indicating that subpopulations of B-cells may indeed play a relevant role in tolerance induction after solid organ transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref022">22</xref>]. Such a tolerogenic signature was characterized by an increase in immature transitional CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> B-cells exhibiting potent immunoregulatory properties compared to recipients with stable allograft function or with biopsy-proven chronic rejection. Although much attention has been focused on regulatory B-cell subsets in human and murine models of autoimmunity, the understanding of their role in solid organ transplantation is still limited. Moreover, information on the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on occurence and function of regulatory B-cells in renal transplant recipients receiving a calcineurin inhibitor based immunosuppressive therapy is scarce.</p>
<p>In this study, we analyzed the distinct subset of CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> Breg cells in renal transplant recipients receiving a calcineurin inhibitor based immunosuppression and compared these results with healthy subjects. The main finding was that calcineurin inhibition reduced the amount of CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> Bregs and inhibited their IL-10 production independent of additional co-medications (e.g. steroids or mycophenolate derivatives) and that a decrease of peripherally circulating Bregs seems to be associated with the incidence of allograft rejection events.</p>

<title>Renal transplant patients</title>
<p>Fourty-six Caucasian patients (26 male, mean age 54 ±14 years, range 23–74) were included that underwent renal transplantation receiving a CNI in combination with mycophenolate acid derivatives and steroids (TAC n = 35; CsA n = 11). None of these patients underwent kidney transplantation before. Mean trough level at timepoint of sample assessment was for TAC 6.2±2.7 ng/mL and 106±30 ng/mL for CsA. Except four, all patients underwent glucocorticoid therapy, mean dosage of prednisone was 6.6±3.3 mg/day. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was given in a fixed dose of one to two times 1 g/day (n = 22) and mycophenolate sodium (MPA one to two times 720 mg/d (n = 14). None of the patients received a B-cell depleting therapy.</p>
<p>Heparinized whole blood samples were collected in the outpatient clinic at periodical routine follow up visits starting six weeks after transplantation. Clinical chemistry was assessed out of the same samples that were used for FACS aquisition. Patients showing signs of acute infections (CrP &gt;0.5 mg/dL) or a history of autoimmune or malignant diseases were excluded from analysis. The mean time after transplantation at the timepoint of sample assessment by flow cytometry was 41 ±45 months. Twelve living donations were among the investigated patients. Ten patients developed a biopsy proved rejection within 24 months before or after measurement. After rejection, flow cytometry analysis was performed earliest after two months. Blood samples of patients with renal allograft rejection were assessed two months after the high pulse dosage steroid treatment was finished. Allograft function and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated and calculated using the MDRD formula (ml/min). Informed consent was obtained before entering the study. The protocols for the investigations in patients and healthy subjects was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University Duisburg-Essen (05–2803). None of the transplant donors were from a vulnerable population and all donors or next of kin provided written informed consent that was freely given.</p>

<p>Heparinized venous blood was collected from all patients. 100μl was immediately used for surface staining using antibodies against CD19, CD24 and CD38. After 20 minutes of incubation at room temperature in the dark, red blood cells were lysed following the manufacturer´s protocol (PeliLyse buffer A1 set, Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Four color FACS analyses was performed by gating first on the lymphocyte and subsequently on the CD19<sup>+</sup> B-cell population.

<title>The percentages of peripherally circulating IL-10 producing B-cells is reduced in calcineurin inhibitor treated renal transplant recipients</title>
<p>After <italic>ex vivo</italic> mitogen stimulation of PBMCs containing the whole white blood cell population with a TLR-9 agonist, ∼4% of all CD19<sup>+</sup> B-cells showed IL-10 production in healthy subjects (n = 9) and even fewer in TAC (n = 5) or CsA (n = 4) treated patients (1.5 ±0.5% and 0.5 ±0.3%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g002">Fig 2A–2D</xref>). None of these patients shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g002">Fig 2</xref> did experience allograft rejection events before or after measurement, they had a stable renal function (mean eGFR 47.3 ±10.2ml/min) and the mean time after transplantation was 65 ±32 months. All patients were treated with steroids and MMF in addition to the CNIs. Co-culture of mitogen stimulated PBMCs of healthy subjects (n = 4) in presence of increasing concentrations of CsA or TAC resulted in a dose dependent reduction of IL-10 production after three days of incubation. Interestingly, the drug concentrations needed to suppress IL-10 production in B-cells were comparable to the trough levels applied in the clinical setting of renal transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g002">Fig 2A–2D</xref>). To get more insight in the possible mechanism and elucidate whether this effect was a secondary consequence of an IL-2 deprivation and abortion of T-cell mediated activation of Bregs, both PBMCs as well as positively isolated B-cells of nine healthy subjects were stimulated and co-cultured with CsA as previously performed. In both cell suspensions IL-10 production was significantly reduced compared to CsA free cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). The data from these unrelated experiments provided evidence that CsA directly inhibited B-cells to produce IL-10.</p>

<title>CsA reduced the percentage of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> cells and IL-10<sup>+</sup> B-cells in healthy non-transplanted subjects</title>
<p>To confirm that the decrease of both B-cells and Bregs in the peripheral circulation is directly caused by calcineurin inhibition, we took advantage of a pre-existing study in which healthy subjects were given CsA in clinical dosages. Whole blood specimen of four healthy subjects were analyzed for the percentage of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> and CD19<sup>+</sup> B-cells. In addition, the amount of IL-10 producing B-cells was assessed using isolated PBMCs and culturing them as described above, before and after a 14 days lasting treatment with CsA. CsA was given body weight adapted 4 times during the first two days using 2.5 mg/kg (high dosage) and then reduced to 0.25 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g003">Fig 3</xref>). After the first two days the mean drug trough level was 117±29 ng/mL. The frequency of CD19<sup>+</sup> B-cells including the CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> subset was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). In contrast, the production of IL-10 in B-cells decreased from 3.7 ±1.3% to 1.5 ±0.8% and IFN-γ in CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cells from 36.2 ±0.5% to 15.6 ±2.5% at day 2. After additional 12 days of low dose CsA treatment all analyzed parameters did further substantially decrease: CD19<sup>+</sup> B-cells from 8.2 ±0.6% at day 0 to 6.9 ±0.3% after 14 days of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), CD24<sup>hi</sup> CD38<sup>hi</sup> B-cells from 4.9 ±1.3% to 2.7 ±0.9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), IL-10<sup>+</sup> B-cells from 3.7 ±1.3% to 2.7 ±0.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), and IFN-γ producing lymphocytes from 36.2 ±0.5% to 26.1 ±2.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Only the frequency of CD25<sup>hi</sup>CD127<sup>lo</sup> expressing CD4+ Tregs remained unaltered. Altogether, these results demonstrate that calcineurin inhibitors reduced the production of IL10<sup>+</sup> in B-cells and that this effect is not restricted to a solid organ transplant setting or a co-medication with steroids or MPA.</p>

<title>A low percentage of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> Bregs in the peripheral blood of renal transplant recipients is associated with a reduced glomerular filtration rate</title>
<p>To evaluate the relevance of our findings the correlation between the percentage of peripherally circulating CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> B-cells and renal allograft function (MDRD formula, eGFR) was tested (Spearman`s rank correlation test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<title>4 Discussion</title>
<p>The presence and function of B regulatory cells are of increasing interest in solid organ transplantation. In particular, the immature transitional CD19<sup>+</sup> B-cell phenotype characterized by the surface expression of CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> was previously suggested to play an important role not only in maintaining long-term allograft function but also in promoting allograft tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we found a reduced amount of peripheral circulating CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> B-cells in renal transplant recipients receiving a calcineurin inhibitor based immunosuppressive therapy when compared to healthy subjects. A low percentage of peripheral circulating CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> B-cells in these patients was associated with a worse clinical outcome in allograft function (eGFR) and allograft rejection events. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies involving CsA treated healthy subjects proved that the reduced surface expression of the CD24 and CD38 molecules as well as the impaired IL-10 production was caused by calcineurin inhibition. Further <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments using immunomagnetic isolated B-cells confirmed that CsA directly affects the Breg’s IL-10 production and excluded the possibility of IL-2 deprivation and/or T helper cell mediated activation of Bregs.</p>
<p>The most widely studied mechanism by which Bregs regulate immune responses is via direct suppression of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells through provision of IL-10. The CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> immature B-cell subset investigated in this study was also shown to exhibit regulatory capability mainly through the release of IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref014">14</xref>]. However, as revealed in patients with SLE, their suppressive capacity was also dependent on CD80/CD86 expression indicating an important role for contact-mediated suppression apart from their production of IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref014">14</xref>]. Although not a primary aim of this study, a further interesting observation was that only a minority of ~14.5% among CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> cells was found to produce IL-10 suggesting indeed that these transitional, immature B-cells are heterogenous and employ alternative mechanisms to exert their regulatory function independently of IL-10. Whether this mechanism is based on secretion of further suppressive soluble factors or solely vial cell-cell contact is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Not only functional defects but also a numerical reduction has been described for CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> immature B-cells and IL-10 producing Breg cells in autoimmune diseases, including SLE and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref008">8</xref>]. In this study, both the percentage of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> immature B-cells in the peripheral circulation as well as the ability of B-cells to produce IL-10 were affected by calcineurin inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Similar findings were described in a very recent work by Shabir et al., who demonstrated a significant decrease of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> cells in pre- to three months posttransplant specimen and normalizing again six months after transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref024">24</xref>]. Recently, Chung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref025">25</xref>] also reported a decrease of the CD19+CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> immature B-cell subset and their production of IL-10 in a cohort of 21 renal transplant patients undergoing a tacrolimus based immunosuppression. Although the authors performed their assay only shortly before and until one month after transplantation these results corroborate our observations. The primary target of CNIs is to prevent the activation of NFAT in T-cells leading to the suppression of IL2-gene transcription. Therefore, a reduced number of T-cells available for B-cell help caused by CNI mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation or the induction of T-cell apoptosis may serve as an obvious and appealing explanation. However, studies elucidating direct effects of CNIs on B-cells are scarce. Especially, their effect on Breg subsets has not been elucidated so far. In purified human B-cells, Heidt et al. and Traitanon et al. demonstrated that in contrast to CsA and tacrolimus, Rapamycin and MPA profoundly inhibited B-cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref026">26</xref>], maturation into plasma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref027">27</xref>] and immunoglobulin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref026">26</xref>], respectively. In addition, the <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on IL-6 and IL-10 production were less pronounced and depended on dosage and type of stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref027">27</xref>]. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings in healthy subjects and in CsA co-cultured immunomagnetic negatively isolated B-cells provide new biologically relevant aspects on this issue, because they clearly demonstrate that the production of IL-10 and hence the regulatory function of Bregs seem to be directly hampered by calcineurin inhibition. These observations furthermore reveal that the IL-10 production of Breg cells may occur without any T-cell interaction. However, the exact mechanism by which Calcineurin inhibitors suppress Breg function remains to be further elucidated.</p>
<p>Although a dose dependent reduction of IL-10 production was observed in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, a correlation of drug trough levels with the amount of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> Bregs in the renal transplant setting was not found. The reason may be a longer exposition of B-cells in patients receiving calcineurin inhibitors one the one hand or the polypharmaceutical treatment on the other. Indeed, most results in renal transplant studies are affected by a multicompound immunosuppressive therapy regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref028">28</xref>] and the majority of the CNI treated recipients receive co-medications with corticosteroids and/or MPA. This makes it difficult to dissect which drug in fact is responsible for the observed reduction of Breg cells. To solve this issue, a subcohort of non-transplanted healthy subjects that received a mono-therapy with CsA was included in this study. To the best of our knowledge this is a unique and so far unreported experiment. It enabled us to demonstrate that the observed reduction in CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> immature Breg subsets is solely mediated by Calcineurin inhibition and that this is independent of a renal transplant setting, renal allograft function or a co-medication with steroids or MPA derivatives.</p>
<p>Breg cells seem to play a crucial role in balancing the alloreactive immune response, as kidney transplanted patients with &lt;1% of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> B-cells had a significant higher risk of experiencing allograft rejection events. Patients that suffered from rejection before or after sample assessment had a significant lower frequency of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> B-cells. Support to these findings is provided by Chesneau and coworkers who demonstrated that tolerant human renal transplant recipients exhibited higher frequencies of CD20<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> transitional and CD20<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>lo</sup>CD24<sup>lo</sup> naive B-cells compared to patients with stable allograft function under immunosuppressive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref023">23</xref>]. Moreover, Silva et al. showed that operational tolerant subjects exhibited preservation in the number of circulating B-cells, particularly for the immature CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> Bregs, in contrast to decreased numbers in subjects with chronic rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref029">29</xref>]. Most recently, Borrows' group also described a protective function of transitional CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> B-cells preventing allograft rejection within the first year of kidney transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref024">24</xref>]. Our findings are in line with Shabir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref024">24</xref>] who also demonstrated that in a cohort of 73 <italic>de novo</italic> kidney transplanted patients a low amount of transitional B-cells correlated with a higher risk of allograft rejection.</p>
<p>Interestingly, allograft rejections in patients exhibiting &lt;1% of peripherally circulating CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> Bregs were mainly cellular mediated (ACMR). Only 30% of these cases were antibody mediated (CAMR) as might be expected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0153170.t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153170.g004">Fig 4</xref>). It is a limitation of this study that the development of <italic>de novo</italic> DSA was not assessed in a time-dependent fashion during our routine follow-up, since this might have enabled us to investigate the relationship in between DSA-producing and tolerogenic B-cells. Irrespectively, these results still allow the conclusion that a conserved Breg subset may protect rather from cellular than from humoral allograft rejections. Further multicenter studies including larger patient cohorts will be needed to fully elucidate these preliminary findings as monitoring of B-cell phenotypes could be of importance to both analyze and better predict the characteristics of a cellular or humoral alloimmune response.</p>
<p>Altogether, these study results suggest that subsets of the CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> Breg population and possibly their production of IL-10 may be an important regulator of the inflammatory alloimmune response and that deficiency or loss of these transitional immature Bregs might be involved in the process of acute and chronic allograft rejection. Moreover, we observed a so far underestimated side effect of CNI inhibitors, especially of CsA in reducing the frequency and hampering the function of immature transitional Bregs that may compromise renal allograft function in the longterm. Whether the impairment of the transitional immature B-cell subset can be considered as an individual predisposition to a toxic side effect of Calcineurin inhibition needs to be clarified in further studies co-investigating pharmacodynamic drug effects.</p>
<p>The analyses of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> Bregs in this study provide a further supplemental piece of relevant information on B regulatory cell components of the recipient’s immune system after renal transplantation. Patients displaying higher transitional B-cell frequencies experienced reduced rejection rates. In addition, CNI treatment results in a reduction of transitional B-cells and hence may negatively influence the development of a favorably balanced B-cell compartment. To investigate whether renal patients are at risk to develop allograft rejection events it thus may be helpful to determine the amount of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> Bregs periodically. The monitoring of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> Bregs may thus have the potential to serve as an adjunct tool to improve the monitoring of the subjects peripheral cellular immunity in order to prevent renal allograft rejection independent from determining drug trough levels. Given the fact that drug trough levels provide no insight in the subjects pharmacodynamic response towards CNIs, a regular assessment of the numerical composition and function of the peripheral cellular immune regulation may gain in importance in the near future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0153170.ref030">30</xref>]. Further studies with a longitudinal monitoring of patients will therefore be necessary to define cut-off values of peripheral circulating CD19<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> Bregs cells that may predict allograft rejection events after solid organ transplantation.</p>
