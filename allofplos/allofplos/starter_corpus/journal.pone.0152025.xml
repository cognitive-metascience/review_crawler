<abstract>
<p>Müller glia (MG), the sole glial cells generated by retinal progenitors, have emerged as a viable cellular target for therapeutic regeneration in degenerative blinding diseases, as they possess dormant stem cell properties. However, the mammalian MG does not display the neurogenic potential of their lower vertebrate counterparts, precluding their practical clinical use. The answer to this barrier may be found in two interlinked processes underlying the neurogenic potential, i.e., the activation of the dormant stem cell properties of MG and their differentiation along the neuronal lineage. Here, we have focused on the former and examined Notch signaling-mediated activation of MG. We demonstrate that one of the targets of Notch signaling is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI), p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, which is highly expressed in quiescent MG. Notch signaling facilitates the activation of MG by inhibiting p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression. This is likely achieved through the Notch- p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and Notch-Skp2-p27<sup>Kip1</sup> axes, the former inhibiting the expression of <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> transcripts and the latter levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> proteins by Skp2-mediated proteasomal degradation. Thus, Notch signaling may facilitate re-entry of MG into the cell cycle by inhibiting p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression both transcriptionally and post-translationally.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The retina, an integral part of the central nervous system (CNS), does not display active neurogenesis under normal conditions in adult mammals. However, when injured it displays neurogenic potential, which can be traced to the major glial cell type of the retina, MG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref003">3</xref>]. Emerging evidence supporting this property of MG has placed them in a similar category as the radial glia in the CNS, where they sub serve the function of neural stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref004">4</xref>]. Recent evidence supports this notion. For example, MG enriched from the mammalian retina displayed central features of neural stem cells, i.e., the ability to self-renew and differentiate along both neuronal and glial lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>]. Examination of the neurotoxin-damaged chick and mammalian retina revealed a rare subset of activated MG that had incorporated BrdU and expressed markers corresponding to retinal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref010">10</xref>]. Furthermore, when activated MG, prospectively enriched from the neurotoxin-damaged retina, were transplanted they integrated in the host retina and expressed markers corresponding to rod photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and RGC layer, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>]. However, despite the evidence of neuronal conversion of the mammalian MG, the efficiency of their neurogenic potential significantly lags behind their lower vertebrate counterparts, such as teleosts, in which retina is regenerated throughout the life. For example, using a variety of injury models and transgenic zebrafish for lineage analyses, various labs have shown an efficient conversion of MG into retinal neurons, particularly photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>These studies demonstrated that the neurogenic property of MG, albeit reduced in mammals, is evolutionarily conserved and may be tapped into for therapeutic regeneration of the mammalian retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref003">3</xref>]. Recently, this notion was tested in a rat model of retinitis pigmentosa, where MG activated by Notch and Wnt signaling and tagged by BrdU/genetic markers were observed to have migrated to the ONL and a rare subset of these migrated MG expressed markers corresponding to rod photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref014">14</xref>]. To understand the reduced neurogenic potential of the mammalian MG, we have begun examining the two interlinked processes underlying the potential, i.e., the activation and neural conversion of MG. Here, we have focused on the former, specifically, how Notch signaling interacts with the intrinsic machinery of MG to regulate their activation. Notch signaling plays an integral role in differentiation of MG during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref019">19</xref>], and in their activation in response to injury both in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>] and lower vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref021">21</xref>]. Activation of the Notch receptor leads to gamma secretase-mediated release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref022">22</xref>]. NICD translocates to the nucleus where it recruits a co-activator complex, consisting of CSL (<underline>C</underline>BF1, <underline>s</underline>uppressor of hairless, and <underline>L</underline>ag1) and Mastermind-like (MAML1), that binds to genes containing the CSL binding sites, activating their transcription. The <italic>Hes</italic> family of genes, a primary target of Notch signaling, encodes transcriptional repressors that attenuate the expression of their target genes by binding to C-box/N-box elements in their promoters. Since Notch signaling induces proliferation in mitotically quiescent MG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>], cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), which regulate cell cycle progression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma proteins by G1-phase cyclins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref023">23</xref>], emerge as potential Notch targets in MG. This premise is supported by the observations that CKIs are targeted by Notch signaling and are known to coordinate cell cycle exit with self-renewal properties of stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref025">25</xref>]. Among the CKIs, p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is likely to be the key regulator of the G1/S transition and S phase progression of MG because, unlike other CKIs such as p57<sup>Kip2</sup> and p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, it is expressed at high levels in adult MG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref027">27</xref>]. Additionally, its expression is inversely co-related with that of its proteasomal regulator, Skp2, which is positively regulated by Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref024">24</xref>]. Based on the previous observations that p27<sup>Kip1</sup> keeps MG from entering the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref028">28</xref>], we hypothesized that Notch signaling-dependent inhibition of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> constitutes a key event in the activation of MG. The test of the hypothesis revealed that Notch signaling regulates the activation of MG by influencing two different Notch-dependent intracellular axes, namely, Notch-p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and Notch-Skp2-p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. Thus, Notch signaling facilitates re-entry of MG into the cell cycle by inhibiting p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression, both transcriptionally and post-translationally.</p>

<title>Enrichment of MG and neurosphere assays</title>
<p>MG were enriched from the retinas of 10–12 PN10 SD rats/batch of analysis using the hypoxia-based method and subsequently analyzed for MG enrichment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>]. Neurosphere assays were carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref014">14</xref>]. Briefly, the enriched MG were cultured in the presence of retinal culture medium (RCM = DMEM-F12, 1X N2 supplement, 2mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin), FGF2 (20 ng/ml), Heparin (2 μg/ml), and either Jag1 peptide (20μM, to activate Notch signaling) and/or DAPT (20μM, to inactivate Notch signaling) for 5 days. For the loss-of-function (LOF) assays, the enriched MG were transduced with <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> or <italic>Skp2</italic> siRNA lentivirus or control lentivirus before the neurosphere assays.</p>

<title>Viral vectors and lentivirus production</title>
<p>The <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> shRNA lentivirus construct was obtained from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA). The <italic>Skp2</italic> siRNA lentivirus construct was obtained from Applied Biological Materials Inc. (ABM, Richmond, BC, Canada). The control GFP lentivirus construct was obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). In the <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> shRNA and <italic>Skp2</italic> siRNA lentivirus constructs, the expression of sh/siRNA sequences were driven by U6 promoters. In GFP lentivirus constructs, the CMV promoter drove expression of the GFP sequence. Lentivirus preparation and transduction were as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref027">27</xref>]. Briefly, the recombinant lentiviral particles were generated using the ABM lentivirus packaging system, followed by transient transfection of 293T cells, and subsequently concentrated using BioVision PEG lentivirus precipitation kit (Milpitas, CA). Virus titer was determined using the ABM lentivirus titration kit. Enriched MG and retinal explants were transduced with lentiviruses with the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2–4, overnight. Viruses were removed the following morning. The specificity of LOF assays by virus-mediated sh/siRNA expression was determined in C6 glioma cells by Western and Q-PCR analyses. The efficiency of transduction in MG was ascertained by simultaneously co-transducing sh/siRNA and GFP lentivirus, where the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells should reflect the sh/siRNA transduction efficiency.</p>

<title>Explant assays</title>
<p>The explant assays were carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref014">14</xref>]. Briefly, retinas removed from PN21 SD rats were placed on a semi-permeable membrane (0.4 mm pore size; Millipore, Temecula, California, USA), with the ganglion cell layer (GCL) oriented upward, and were maintained in RCM with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Canada). Explants were transduced with <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> shRNA or <italic>Skp2</italic> siRNA or control lentivirus (overnight, with removal of viral media the following morning) and cultured in the presence of Jag1 (20μM) or Jag1+MG132 (2μM) for 5 days. Before explants were collected for analyses on day 5, they were exposed to 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA, 10μM) for 8 hours. To determine the efficiency of the LOF approach, explants were simultaneously co-transduced with a GFP lentivirus and either <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> shRNA or <italic>Skp2</italic> siRNA lentivirus.</p>

<title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis</title>
<p>ChIP analysis was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref031">31</xref>]. Antibody-specific information for ChIP (as well as Western and immunofluorescence analyses) can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0152025.t002">Table 2</xref>. Briefly, cells were first cross-linked and serially quenched with 1% formaldehyde and glycine, respectively, followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-Hes1/anti-CSL antibodies and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation kit (Magna CHIP HiSens, Millipore, Germany) as per manufacturer’s instruction. For controls, immunoprecipitation was carried out with specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. After proteinase and RNAse A digestion, the precipitated DNA was purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc). Regular PCR was carried out using promoter-specific primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0152025.t001">Table 1</xref>), followed by the resolution of the PCR products by gel electrophoresis.</p>

<title>Evidence of Notch-dependent regulatory axes during late retinal histogenesis and MG activation</title>
<p>To determine whether or not the proposed Notch-dependent regulatory axes exist during late retinal histogenesis, when MG are generated, we examined the temporal patterns of expression of the axes’ components against those encoding the regulators of progenitors and MG. During late histogenesis, retinal progenitors are progressively depleted as they differentiate into late born retinal cells. Accordingly, levels of transcripts corresponding to <italic>Nestin</italic>, a neural progenitor marker, and <italic>Hes1</italic>, the Notch-dependent regulator of retinal progenitors, decreased with time, compared to those at the beginning of late histogenesis, i.e., the embryonic day 18 (E18) stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). In contrast, a reciprocal temporal increase in levels of MG-specific transcripts, <italic>glutamine synthetase</italic> (<italic>GS</italic>), was observed, demonstrating the expected inverse temporal relationship between the loss and gain of progenitor and MG phenotypes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Next, we examined the temporal expression patterns of <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Sox9</italic>, both associated with retinal progenitors during retinal histogenesis and matured MG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref036">36</xref>]. Levels of <italic>p27</italic><sup>Kip1</sup> and <italic>Sox9</italic> transcripts decreased with time, however, the trend in temporal decrease plateaued around PN10 and increased there after such that significant transcript levels were detected at PN20, compared to those at PN10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Levels of transcripts corresponding to <italic>Skp2</italic>, a direct target of Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref024">24</xref>], temporally decreased in parallel with the attenuation in the levels of <italic>Hes1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). These observations suggested that the components of Notch-dependent regulatory axes, i.e., <italic>Notch-p27</italic><sup>Kip1</sup> and <italic>Notch-Skp2-p27</italic><sup>Kip1</sup>, were expressed during late retinal histogenesis, which may be recruited for MG activation. We tested this hypothesis in enriched MG culture, a robust model for testing the activation and progenitor properties of MG when coupled with neurosphere assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref014">14</xref>]. We first examined the expression of the components of the proposed axes in enriched MG; immunocytochemical analysis revealed glutamine synthetase (GS)<sup>+</sup> MG co-expressing immunoreactivities corresponding to Sox9, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, Hes1, Skp2, and NICD (activated Notch1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g001">Fig 1G</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we examined the perturbation of Notch signaling in FGF2-mediated neurosphere assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>]. To activate Notch signaling, we cultured MG in the presence of Jag1, a 17-amino-acid peptide, corresponding to a region in the CSL domain of Notch ligand, Jagged1 (Jag1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref014">14</xref>]. To attenuate Notch signaling, MG were cultured in the presence of DAPT, a small molecule that compromises the generation of NICD by inhibiting gamma-secretase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref014">14</xref>]. By the end of five days in control culture conditions, a subset of MG generated neurospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Cells in neurospheres expressed Nestin and Sox9, and incorporated BrdU, thus displaying their progenitor nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). However, when MG were cultured in the presence of Jag1, they generated neurospheres which were significantly larger and more numerous, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g002">Fig 2B, 2C and 2D</xref>). In contrast, when DAPT was added to the culture medium, MG gave rise to significantly smaller and fewer neurospheres, compared to those in either Jag1 group or controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g002">Fig 2B, 2C and 2D</xref>). Quantification of neurosphere cells after 8 hour exposure to BrdU in the culture medium revealed a significant increase and decrease in the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the Jag1 and DAPT groups, respectively, versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), corroborating effects of Jag1/DAPT on MG proliferation as ascertained by changes in the frequency and size of neurospheres. That the effects on MG proliferation were due to the perturbation in Notch signaling was demonstrated by a relative increase and decrease in the levels of <italic>Hes1</italic> transcripts in the presence of Jag1 and DAPT, respectively, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). The effects of Notch signaling on MG proliferation is likely due to its influence on cell cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref025">25</xref>]. To test this premise, we examined the effects of perturbation in Notch signaling on cell cycle by flow cytometry. We observed a relative increase in the proportions of cells in the S phase in Jag1 group versus controls, which decreased remarkably when cells were exposed to DAPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). The increase in the ratio of the proportion of cells in G1/G2 and S phase between Jag1 and DAPT groups revealed that DAPT led to the arrest of MG at both G1 and G2 phases, suggesting the influence of Notch signaling on cell cycle regulation during the activation of MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). Next, we were interested in knowing whether or not Notch signaling influenced the dormant stem cell properties of the activated MG. Another attribute, besides the capacity to generate clonal neurospheres of activated MG, is their ability to emerge as side population (SP) cells when subjected to the Hoechst dye efflux assay (HDEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>]. SP cell phenotype is a universal characteristic of stem cells/progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref039">39</xref>]. We observed a relative increase in the proportion of MG-SP cells in the presence of Jag1 versus controls, which decreased in the presence of DAPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Together, these results suggested that Notch signaling influenced the proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and stem cell properties of the activated MG.</p>

<title>Influence of Notch signaling on <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Skp2</italic> expressions during MG activation</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether or not Notch signaling influenced the expression of <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Skp2</italic> during the activation of MG. Since the premise required Notch signaling to influence their expression at transcriptional and post-translational levels, we examined both their transcript and protein expressions. We first determined the effects of Notch signaling on levels of <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Skp2</italic> transcripts. We observed that the levels of transcripts corresponding to <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Skp2</italic> decreased and increased significantly in MG-derived neurospheres exposed to Jag1, respectively, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Exposure of neurospheres to DAPT abrogated the effects of Jag1 on the expression of <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Skp2</italic>; DAPT significantly increased and decreased <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Skp2</italic> transcript levels, respectively, compared to those in Jag1-treated groups, thus restoring to those in controls. The lack of significant difference in <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Skp2</italic> transcript levels, when compared between controls and DAPT groups, is likely due to the stability of NICD in glial cells (see below) and the fact that <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Skp2</italic> are regulated by other mechanisms in addition to Notch signaling. Next, to test the premise that <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Skp2</italic> expression are under Notch-mediated transcriptional repression and activation, respectively, we examined their proximal promoters for the presence of Hes1/CSL binding sites. Genes targeted by Notch signaling for repression, such as <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup>, contains C-box or class C site (CACGCG) elements where Hes1 forms transcriptional repression complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref023">23</xref>]. Conversely, the direct target of Notch genes, such as <italic>Hes1</italic>/<italic>Skp2</italic>, contains CSL binding sites (TGGGAA) where NICD forms a complex for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref024">24</xref>]. To demonstrate that these sites were occupied by Hes1/CSL in MG, and therefore were targets of Notch-mediated transcriptional regulation, we carried out ChIP analyses of <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup>/<italic>Skp2</italic> promoters using Hes1/CSL antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g003">Fig 3D and 3F</xref>). We observed that Hes1 and CSL antibodies precipitated complexes from MG nuclei, containing DNA sequences corresponding to <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) and <italic>Skp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) proximal promoters, the class C site and CSL binding sites, respectively. These DNA sequences with specific binding sites were absent in the ChIP assays carried out using IgG. Together, these observations suggested that both <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Skp2</italic> are targeted by Notch signaling during MG activation.</p>

<p>Next, we examined whether or not Notch signaling influenced p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and Skp2 expression post-translationally. We examined levels of these proteins in response to perturbation of Notch signaling against the backdrop of their levels in enriched MG by Western analyses, carried out on pooled samples of cells/neurospheres because of the cell number limitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g004">Fig 4</xref>). A semi-quantitative analysis of the intensity of immunoreactive bands corresponding to specific protein levels in different conditions with respect to those at E18 revealed the following: robust levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> were observed in enriched MG, which decreased by more than 3 fold in FGF2 and Jag-1-treated groups (p27<sup>Kip1</sup>/GAPDH: 1:00 versus 0.30 and 0.25, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). p27<sup>Kip1</sup> levels remained decreased in DAPT-treated group relative to that in E18. However, when compared to Jag-1-treated groups, p27<sup>Kip1</sup> levels were observed to be relatively higher (p27<sup>Kip1</sup>/GAPDH: 0.25 versus 0.35). In contrast, levels of Skp2 increased in FGF2 and Jag-1 groups, compared to that in E18 (Skp2/GAPDH: 1:00 versus 1.30 and 2.93, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Skp2 levels in DAPT-treated groups remained lower versus all groups; they were more than 3 fold lower when compared to that in the FGF2 and Jag-1-treated groups (Skp2/GAPDH: 0.42 versus 1.30 and 2.93, respectively). That Notch signaling was perturbed in the experimental paradigm was demonstrated by an increase in NICD levels in FGF2/Jag-1-treated groups, compared to those in MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The decrease in NICD levels in response to DAPT treatment was observed in relation to FGF2/Jag-1 treatment. The detection of NICD in the presence of DAPT suggested an altered post-translational regulation for persistent Notch signaling, presumably required for the maintenance of glial phenotype. For example, the loss of function of Fbxw7 (F-box- and WD-repeat domain containing protein 7), which is required for targeted degradation of NICD, leads to accumulation of NICD with skewed differentiation of neural stem cells into astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref040">40</xref>]. The accumulation of NICD may directly affect <italic>Skp2</italic> through transcriptional regulation and maintain its levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) but not Skp2 protein, which might undergo normal degradation to have lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, graph). To address whether or not the lack of difference in relative levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and Skp2 proteins in FGF2 and Jag-1 groups were bonafide or due to the pooling of cells, we carried out quantitative Western analysis. Because of cell limitations, particularly in the DAPT group, where size and numbers of neurospheres were low, the analysis included only two groups. We observed a significant decrease and increase in levels of immunoreactivities corresponding to p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) and Skp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g004">Fig 4E</xref>) in the Jag1 group, respectively, compared to the FGF2 group. Together, these observations suggested that Notch signaling-mediated transcriptional and post-translational regulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and Skp2 might play a role in the activation of MG.</p>

<title>Involvement of <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> in Notch-dependent activation of MG</title>
<p>To test whether or not <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> is involved in Notch-dependent activation of MG, we examined the effects of Jag1 on the activation of MG where levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> were experimentally attenuated. The loss of function (LOF) approach was preferred over the gain of function (GOF) approach, as the latter may lead to non-specific effects. Given the cell number limitation that precluded Western analysis in MG, we tested the efficiency and specificity of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> LOF in C6 glioma cells. We observed that <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> shRNA lentivirus-mediated transduction caused a reproducible and significant decrease in levels of both proteins and transcripts corresponding to p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Next, enriched MG were transduced with <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> shRNA or control lentivirus and subjected to neurosphere assays in the presence of Jag1 peptide. We measured the generation frequency of neurospheres and the proportion of SP cells to evaluate the effects of the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> LOF on proliferation and stem cell property of the activated MG, respectively. We observed a significant decrease in <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> transcripts levels in the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> LOF group, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), which was correlated with a significant increase in the number of neurospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), suggesting that the loss of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression further facilitated Notch-mediated generation of neurospheres. The neurospheres were subjected to HDEA to measure the proportion of SP cells by flow cytometry. The proportion of MG-SP cells was observed to have almost doubled in the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> LOF group, compared to controls (0.26% versus 0.15%), suggesting an increase in the number of MG cells with stem cell property when the function of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> was compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, to determine that the Notch-dependent effects on the activation of enriched MG is not a function of the enrichment protocol that entails the exposure of MG to hypoxia and prolonged culture conditions, we carried out p27<sup>Kip1</sup> LOF experiments in adult retinal explants, where <italic>in vivo</italic> cell-cell interactions are maintained and functional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref039">39</xref>]. Adult SD rat retinal explants were transduced with <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> shRNA or control lentivirus and cultured in retinal culture medium. BrdU was added in the last 8 hours before the termination of the culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref014">14</xref>]. Immunohistochemical analyses of retinal explants revealed a decrease in immunoreactivities corresponding to p27<sup>Kip1</sup> in the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> LOF group, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In contrast, we observed an increase in immunoreactivities corresponding to Sox9 and those detecting the incorporated BrdU, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). These immunoreactivities, representing MG and proliferating cells, respectively, were largely confined to the inner nuclear layer and were co-localized. Since proliferating MG tend to migrate in retinal explant or in response to injury <italic>in vivo</italic>, some of these cells were also localized in the ONL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref014">14</xref>]. Quantification of Sox9<sup>+</sup> BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells (= activated MG), revealed their numbers to be significantly increased in the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> LOF group versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). To further determine the specificity of the LOF approach, we co-transduced retinal explants with <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> shRNA lentivirus+GFP lentivirus/GFP lentivirus and cultured them as above. Explants were dissociated, transduced MG were identified as GFP epifluorescent cells, which co-expressed immunoreactivities corresponding to BrdU and glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST), an MG-specific marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Quantification of GFP<sup>+</sup> GLAST<sup>+</sup> BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells revealed a significantly higher proportion in the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> LOF group versus controls, suggesting along with the above results, that the loss of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> function facilitates Notch signaling-mediated activation of MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g006">Fig 6E</xref>).

<title>Involvement of <italic>Skp2</italic> in Notch-dependent activation of MG</title>
<p>Next, we used the LOF approach, as described above, to determine whether or not Skp2 was involved in Notch-dependent activation of MG. First, we examined the efficiency and specificity of the Skp2 LOF approach in C6 glioma cells, where <italic>Skp2</italic> siRNA lentivirus-mediated transduction led to a reproducible decrease in Skp2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) levels, compared to controls. Second, when enriched MG were transduced with <italic>Skp2</italic> siRNA or control lentivirus and subjected to neurospheres assay in the presence of Jag1, a significant decrease in <italic>Skp2</italic> transcripts levels was observed, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Correspondingly, we observed an increase in the levels of p27<sup>kip1</sup> protein in <italic>Skp2</italic> siRNA-treated neurospheres, compared to controls, demonstrating the regulatory influence of Skp2 on p27<sup>kip1</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). The decrease in <italic>Skp2</italic> expression was correlated with a significant decrease in numbers of neurospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g007">Fig 7E</xref>), suggesting that the reduction of <italic>Skp2</italic> expression abrogated Notch-mediated generation of neurospheres. Since Skp2 mediates proteasomal degradation of target proteins such as p27<sup>Kip1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref024">24</xref>], it was expected that the pharmacological inhibition of proteasomes would have similar effects as the inhibition of Skp2 expression. To test this premise, enriched MG were subjected to neurosphere assay in the presence of proteasomal inhibitor MG132 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref041">41</xref>]. The presence of MG132 led to a significant decrease in the generation of neurospheres, compared to controls, suggesting that the effects of Notch signaling at the post-transcriptional levels involved proteasomal degradation of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). Third, we carried out HDEA on <italic>Skp2</italic>/control siRNA lentivirus-transduced MG-derived neurospheres. We observed 0.15% of MG-SP cells in Jag1-treated neurospheres, the proportion of which decreased to 0.07% and 0.08% when MG were pre-transduced with <italic>Skp2</italic> siRNA lentivirus or cultured in the presence of MG132, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g007">Fig 7G</xref>).</p>

<p>Lastly, to rule out that the observed effects were peculiar to enriched MG, Skp2 LOF experiments were carried out on retinal explants, as described above, where the transduction with <italic>Skp2</italic> siRNA led to a decrease in Skp2 immunoreactivities in retinal explants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A variety of approaches involving different species suggests that MG, besides maintaining retinal homeostasis, may act as progenitors, capable of supporting neurogenesis in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref003">3</xref>]. The evidence emerging from teleosts, particularly transgenic zebrafish, is robust for the neurogenic potential of MG; they serve as progenitors for photoreceptors during normal development and are recruited in response to injury for regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref003">3</xref>]. While such regenerative properties of MG were not observed in the mammalian retina, they have been observed to respond to injury by re-entering the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref043">43</xref>]. Given their regenerative capacity in lower vertebrates and biochemical resemblance with radial glia, examination of MG enriched from rodent retina revealed that a subset of these cells possessed the ability to self renew and differentiate along the neuronal lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>]. It was observed that the display of stem cell properties by MG <italic>in vitro</italic> was accompanied by the activation of Notch signaling, and that its inhibition significantly compromised the abilities of these cells to generate clonal neurospheres in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>] or incorporate BrdU <italic>in vivo</italic> in response to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref014">14</xref>]. The involvement of Notch signaling in the regulation of MG is also observed in zebrafish regeneration, where the temporal sequence of the activation of Notch signaling is better understood than in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref002">2</xref>]. For example, molecular examination of <italic>gfap-EGFP</italic>-labeled MG, enriched after different time intervals following a light induced lesion in transgenic zebrafish, revealed that during the initial stages of the injury, when MG have not yet divided, the indices of Notch signaling were decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref044">44</xref>]. However, following injury, a stage associated with MG division, the expression of the components of Notch signaling were up-regulated, suggesting an association of Notch signaling with MG proliferation, as observed in mammals.</p>
<p>Among the multiple signaling pathways that are recruited for the development and differentiation of the retina, the one that is more appropriately placed, enabling MG to sense and respond to injury, is the Notch signaling. It is used in its classical function to regulate cell commitment and also to promote proliferation of progenitor/precursor populations, as observed in a variety of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref045">45</xref>]. In the developing retina, Notch receptor activation ensures that a subset of progenitors remain uncommitted during early histogenesis, presumably to sustain the prolonged cell type-specific differentiation. During late histogenesis, Notch receptors are recruited to promote differentiation of MG, and therefore, when Notch signaling is experimentally perturbed, MG generation is adversely impacted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref046">46</xref>]. How does Notch function change from maintaining progenitor populations during early histogenesis to promoting differentiation of glia in late histogenesis remains poorly understood. It is thought that the strengthening of the JAK-STAT pathway in retinal progenitors, at the behest of cytokines secreted by differentiating cells during late histogenesis, may underlie the gliogenic effects of Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref048">48</xref>]. Evidence based on the spatial localization of the expression of Notch receptor in adult retina suggests that Notch signaling may remain active in MG or at least in a subset of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref052">52</xref>]. The role of Notch signaling in adult MG remains unexplored, however, current observations suggest that it is involved in cell cycle regulation to sustain the regenerative role of MG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref002">2</xref>]. For example, experimental accentuation of Notch signaling in S334 rats in the beginning of rod photoreceptor degeneration results in MG proliferation and migration to the ONL where a minor subset of these cells begin to express markers corresponding to degenerated neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref014">14</xref>]. Similar influence of Notch signaling on MG proliferation and regenerative potential has been observed in chicks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref053">53</xref>]. Here, we have demonstrated the possible mechanism by which the activation of Notch signaling is linked to MG proliferation. While <italic>myc</italic> and <italic>cyclins</italic> have been demonstrated to be the direct targets of Notch signaling for G1-S transition in Notch-activated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref054">54</xref>], it is likely that the proliferative influence in MG is mediated through p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152025.g009">Fig 9</xref>). p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is up regulated during histogenesis to promote committed progenitors/precursors exit from the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref036">36</xref>]. Its expression attenuates in differentiated cells but persists in MG as one of its characteristic molecular features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref055">55</xref>]. While the maintenance of high levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression in terminally differentiated cells is rather enigmatic, it could be suggested that in MG, it is employed to keep their evolutionarily conserved propensity to re-enter the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref001">1</xref>]. In this model, Notch signaling, influenced by adjacent cells and/or by Mash-1 based cell intrinsic machinery observed in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref056">56</xref>], abrogates the levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> proteins by acting through the <italic>Notch-p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and <italic>Notch-Skp2-p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> axes. The recruitment of these axes, one inhibiting the transcription of <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup> and the other leading to the Skp2-mediated degradation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> proteins, may have evolved for a rapid and sustained proliferative response of MG to injury.</p>

<title>Notch signaling regulates p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression to influence the activation of MG.</title>
<p>p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression persists in MG as one of their characteristic molecular features. The activation of Notch signaling in quiescent MG leads to a decrease in the expression of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> through Hes1-mediated transcriptional repression and Skp2-mediated post-translational inhibition, promoting the G1-S transition.</p>

<p>Our observations shed light on the possible mechanism of Notch signaling-mediated activation of MG, and not when it is employed or how it is linked to the neural conversion of MG. If one leans upon the evidence emerging from zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref056">56</xref>], it might not be implausible to consider that sometime during the early response of MG to injury, Notch signaling is recruited to facilitate a cell proliferation response. This window is likely to be narrow and with the change in context, spatial (migration out of the INL) and/or temporal, the effects of Notch signaling would also change. If Notch signaling persists when MG are poised for neuronal conversion, it might be deleterious for the regenerative process, given the inhibitory influence of Notch signaling on the expression of pro-neural genes. Therefore, inhibiting Notch signaling at this stage has been observed to expand the regenerative field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref056">56</xref>] as well as neuronal conversion of MG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0152025.ref002">2</xref>]. Similar temporal manipulation of Notch signaling, directly or indirectly, by targeting the Notch-dependent molecular axes, may help recruit MG for regeneration in the mammalian retina.</p>
