# MDPI Open Peer Review Corpus

Section for Logic & Cognitive Science, Institute of Philosophy and Sociology, Polish Academy of Science

MDPI is committed to open peer review idea, but these are voluntary. They are not available for download in a single package, so they must be crawled from their website.

The data set contains all available peer reviews as of January 2023. In addition, the corpus contains metadata about particular reviews, author responses and paper metadata in the JSON format. The JSON `schema` files are available in the schema subdirectory in files with self-explanatory names.

The original files were not enriched with any linguistic annotation or converted to any format (these are predominantly PDF, TXT, and DOCX files, as uploaded through the MDPI editorial system by reviewers).

Additionally, we are making the crawler code available. See the [README](../crawling/README.md) file in `review_crawler/crawling` directory.

The files are being made available under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
