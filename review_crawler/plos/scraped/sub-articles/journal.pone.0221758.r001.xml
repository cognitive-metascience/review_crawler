<p>Association of frequency of television watching with overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in India: Evidence from a nationally representative study</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Das Gupta,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>The scientific rationale should be reviewed and strengthened. Reviewer 1 and myself take issue with p-values and CI. Table 1 simply does not need any p-values, especially not in the form proposed (***). Accordingly, the text needs changes, you can simply state that the differences were all stat.significant at a level of p&lt;0.001).</p>
<p>For the AOR, where you show CI, please refrain from p-values, and thus delete all the asterisks from table 2.</p>
<p>Please also revise the discussion to reflect the rationale and the importance of the findings in this context.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Aug 26 2019 11:59PM.

<p>Title</p>
<p>Association of frequency of television watching with overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in India: Evidence from a nationally representative study</p>
<p>Comments</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity of reading this paper. This is a simple paper, but it is related with an important topic.</p>
<p>I enjoy reading it, but I have some concerns and comments that I address to the authors.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>I start reading the paper with great expectation. The rationale was OK, but it was not explore why is important to study the relationship between overweight/obesity and sedentary behaviour among women of reproductive age. Are these women at risk of being obese? Well, the authors did not present any indication of that.</p>
<p>Page 7, line 115. I am not aware what is the recommended age for being pregnant. Why authors used women aged 15-49 as sample?</p>
<p>Page 9, lines 153-155. How was used the PCA to measure the household wealth index? Can the authors describe the results of the PCA?</p>
<p>Page 15, lines 209-218 (table 1). Looking to the table 1, we can see that there are significant differences among the categories of all variable. If fact this was expected because the sample is huge. Therefore, p-value in this cases is not so important. Can the authors provide the 95% CI for the % of BMI status?</p>
<p>I know that it is a boring work for the authors to provide the 95% CI for all numbers, but it seems to be important.</p>
<p>Page 14, lines 220-223. If the authors want to present a figure, it would be more important to use a figure focus on study aim. For instance, it could be a figure showing the relationship of watch television and obesity.</p>
<p>Page 16, table 2. Asterisks should be put after the CI. For example: 1.05 (1.02-1.08)***, instead of 1.05***(1.02-1.08).</p>
<p>Page 18, lines 295-296. Why women who watch TV in the rural areas tend to adopt a sedentary lifestyle? I am asking that because women can watch TV at night, after a workday and it might not be related to a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
<p>Page 18, line 298. Delete the word "ect".</p>
<p>Page 18, lines 303-305. A dose-response relationship cannot be observed in a cross sectional study. This assumption is exaggerated.</p>
<p>The discussion has the same weakness as the introduction section. Authors do not explain why it is important to study obesity among women of reproductive age. Without this explanation this is only on more study that tried to explained the relationship between obesity and time spend watching TV.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This study investigated the Association of frequency of television watching with overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in India. The method used was the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist for cross-sectional studies. The paper referred to relevant studies throughout the introduction and discussion sections, citing relevant populations and recent findings. The authors raised pertinent issues around the association of obesity and diferents factors of risk. The suggestions around prevention programs. The results were reported clearly and the tables were well presented.</p>
