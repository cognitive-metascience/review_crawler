<p>Dolutegravir based antiretroviral therapy compared to other combined antiretroviral regimens for the treatment of HIV-infected naive patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Cruciani,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>The reviewer(s) and I have evaluated the paper. After full consideration of the comments, I believe that the paper could be of interest to PLOS ONE readers but a number of questions must be addressed and changes&#160; made to render this manuscript suitable for publication, See comments by Reviewer #1.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by the next 12 weeks.

<p>3. We note that you have included the phrase &#8220;data not shown&#8221; in your manuscript. Unfortunately, this does not meet our data sharing requirements. PLOS does not permit references to inaccessible data. We require that authors provide all relevant data within the paper, Supporting Information files, or in an acceptable, public repository. Please add a citation to support this phrase or upload the data that corresponds with these findings to a stable repository (such as Figshare or Dryad) and provide and URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers that may be used to access these data. Or, if the data are not a core part of the research being presented in your study, we ask that you remove the phrase that refers to these data.</p>
<p>4. Please confirm that you have included all items recommended in the PRISMA checklist including an assessment of publication bias using graphical methods (e.g. Funnel plot) and statistical methods (e.g. Egger&#8217;s test) as appropriate; details of reasons for study exclusions in the PRISMA flowchart and number of studies excluded for each reason; and the full electronic search strategy used to identify studies with all search terms and limits for at least one database.</p>
<p>5. We noticed you have some minor occurrence of overlapping text with the following previous publication(s), which needs to be addressed:</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf" ns0:type="simple">https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf</ext-link></p>

<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: There are several mislabeled items in the plots. Please mention if the authors performed tests for multiplicity.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The Authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing dolutegravir-containing ART to non-dolutegravir containing ART in HIV-infected naive patients.The manuscript is well written and represents a very comprehensive analysis on this topic. The methodology is adequate and updated.</p>
<p>I have just one suggestion. Since the use of patients reported outcomes represent a more useful tool compared to clinician report of adverse events and they can explore outcomes such as patients' satisfaction with treatment, and considering the high virological response rates reported in some comparison between INSTI-based regimens in particular, it could be useful to include, when available, PROs as specific outcomes in the metanalysis (Whol, The Patient - Patient-Centered Outcomes Research, 2018).</p>
