<p>PONE-D-19-17515</p>
<p>Validating a Popular Outpatient Antibiotic Database</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Schwartz,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p>ACADEMIC EDITOR: </p>
<p>Overall this manuscript addresses an important topic and has used a robust &#160;methodology and chose to use Bland Altman plots which was an excellent choice. However there are certain issues to address to improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>Please respond to all the&#160;peer reviewer comments . In addition please respond to the following Academic Editor 's comments</p>
<p>1.Reviewer 2 noted 2 previous citations presented in poster format that did comparisons from 2 Canadian provinces which had comprehensive data ( all ages) &#160;on outpatient prescriptions and one compared the data from the Xponent database so the authors need to rephrase their comments " to our knowledge community antibiotic use data has neve been externally validated.." which appears in a couple of settings in the manuscript.</p>
<p>2. You mention about a variety of prescription drug databases in the Introduction. Please add a couple of sentences to describe the commonly used ones and their differences eg Compuscript, the Canadian Disease and Therapeutic Index ,&#160; National Prescription Audit &#160;data and National Sales and Prescriptions data for the benefit of the readership.</p>
<p>3. Provide an estimate of NIHB prescriptions that may have been missed .</p>
<p>4. Please explicitly &#160;explain if the prescriptions from non physician prescribers eg dentists, midwives, podiatrists etc were excluded reliably from the Xponent database which has obvious important implications</p>
<p>5. Please describe the geographic pharmacy difference if possible and what implications it may have</p>
<p>6. The Discussion is missing a limitations paragraph and there are several important ones - some mentioned earlier in the manuscript &#160;but should be highlighted plus other mentioned about the limitations of the Xponenet database, non captured scripts eg NIHB, other prescribers, missing data and its influence and impact of a sensitivity analysis of &gt; 14 days use as opposed to 8 .</p>
<p>7. There are several typos that need to be fixed eg refs 7-35 , presume it is 7, 35, missing words in some of the sentences</p>
<p>8. The references are very sloppy and full of errors ( too numerous to count ) &#160;in case, non use of urls and date of access, inappropriate case, spacing, non use of italics for Latin terms , incomplete references, missing references, inappropriate journal abbreviations&#160;and appear not to have been proof read by the authors very carefully . Please clean up&#160;ALL errors in the references.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Overall, this is a well written paper on a topic of considerable importance. Recognizing the need for reliable outpatient antibiotic utilization data, this study attempts to validate a pre-existing database that can be used to optimize outpatient antimicrobial stewardship. The study limitations were well recognized and stated clearly [ie. insufficient correlation between specific antibiotics and inability to validate for a) patients &lt;65 years old, b) refill prescriptions]. The study also identified a weakness in the database with respect to the rural population which was well explained. The article's greatest strength is its rigorous statistical analyses.</p>
<p>A few additional comments for author response are:</p>
<p>1. With a NPV of 73%, 23% of prescribers were classified as belonging to the highest quartile of antibiotic prescribing when really they belonged to the top 40% according to OBD (the gold standard database). From an antimicrobial stewardship perspective, this discrepancy is acceptable because it still represents a physician group that should be targeted for further stewardship education and optimization of antibiotic use. However, from a clinician's perspective, being labeled as within the top 25% is very different from top 40%, the former signalling higher end of normal and the latter potentially being close to the mean. This NPV may not be acceptable to a clinician receiving their antibiotic prescribing summary.</p>
<p>2. Given a large subset of physicians are likely not represented (eg. rural physician etc), it would be interesting to see how many registered physicians within Ontario are excluded from the Xponent database entirely and therefore would not be subject to antibiotic utilization scrutiny. Is it possible to match the physicians to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario to obtain this number?</p>
<p>3. The authors performed multiple separate analyses for female vs. male genders and demonstrated that there were was a slightly greater relative difference in prescribing for male patients. Nevertheless, the discussions section lacked explanations on the potential reasons and significance of this finding. This should be further elaborated on.</p>
<p>4. The antibiotic prescribing rate "antibiotic prescriptions/100 total prescriptions" is an interesting metric. It is conceivable that a clinician whom is prescribing antibiotics excessively would likely prescribe other drugs excessively as well thereby obscuring the increased antibiotic use. It was reassuring to see that "antibiotic prescriptions/100 total prescriptions" correlated well with "antibiotic prescriptions / 100 patient visits" given the denominator for antibiotic utilization is typically patient visits to take into account differences in patient volume. It is not clear to me where the patient visit denominator is coming from (is it from OBD or an alternate source) and could these not just be incorporated into the numerator generated from Xponent rather than relying on the "antibiotic prescriptions/100 total prescriptions".</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This topic is of great interest to likely a small group of individuals. IQVIA formerly Brogan, formerly IMS has recorded data on antimicrobial and other drug utilization from retail pharmacies for many years. The validity of the methods to extrapolate from the sample of pharmacies to the whole population has never been public and therefore the science community has been left to wonder how well their proprietary methods work and can they be trusted for research. In addition to the cited work of Tan (reference 42), two other groups in Canada have completed similar work in conference papers and could be cited (Dalton, B; Sabuda D, Bresee L et al. External Validation of Estimates of Antibacterial Dispensing in the IMS Brogan Xponent&#174; Database in a Canadian Province. IDWeek 2013 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://idsa.confex.com/idsa/2013/webprogram/Paper41244.html" ns0:type="simple">https://idsa.confex.com/idsa/2013/webprogram/Paper41244.html</ext-link>) &amp; Chong M, Dutil L, Bhatia T, Marra F, Patrick DM. Assessing antimicrobial consumption</p>
<p>using two different methodologies in British Columbia. Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol</p>
<p>2007; 18(1): 35 Abstract A3.</p>
<p>In general, the authors have conducted a careful analysis using appropriate methods, and this manuscript is likely deserving of publication. I have a few suggestions to help make small improvements in clarity.</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to reliably predict the top 25 percentile of prescribers of antimicrobials to patients 65 and older, by identifying them in a public database of all pharmacies and comparing to the IQVIA database. I think the authors could do a better job describing this objective in the title as one does not reflexively think that quantification and validation would be performed at a physician level. I think some discussion of how these data would relate to the exponent database derived data on population level antimicrobial utilization would be appropriate (or if not at all, please state) and the conclusion "that the xponent database is validated for patients 65 and older " is actually inaccurate considering the principle finding of validating the identification of high prescibers of antibiotics in a population of 65 and older. "</p>
<p>The definition of physician antibiotic prescribing rate is unclear. Is this based on number of prescriptions, days of therapy or DDD etc.</p>
<p>Physicians were excluded for "prescribing less than 9 antibiotics". Does this mean &lt;9 antibiotic prescriptions over the time period? Can you explain this number?</p>
<p>Could you define "antibiotics" in the study methods better? eg "systemic antibacterials" rather than just referring reader to the supplement.</p>
<p>The methods and results for agreement are confusing. In the methods it is stated the agreement of quartile groupings was evaluated, so one expects results in terms of categorical analysis. However in the text of results and table 3 mean number of of antibiotics prescriptions per physicians is reported.</p>
<p>The agreement on antibiotic prescribing per 100 prescriptions was assessed by Bland Altman plots. I am unclear of the relevance of antibiotic prescription per 100 prescriptions. This should be discussed in background and discussion.</p>
<p>If there are a significant number of non physician prescribers in Ontario, are they captured in ODB and exponent? Even if their prescribing rates are lower than that of physicians, it would be useful to note if agreement is similar with non physicians.</p>
<p>In figures 5 and S3 one can observe correlation but there appears to be bias with discounting of the xponent values. This is not commented upon. Can the slope of the regression line be provided? It would also provide easier interpretation if the x and y axes were given the same scales and number values.</p>
