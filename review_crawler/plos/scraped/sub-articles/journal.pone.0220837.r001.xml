<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Professor Walker,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p>ACADEMIC EDITOR: All issues raised by expert reviewers are required. The authors should limit speculations and highlight limitations of the study.</p>

<p>Journal Requirements:</p>
<p>1. When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>2. Please include captions for your Supporting Information files at the end of your manuscript, and update any in-text citations to match accordingly. Please see our Supporting Information guidelines for more information: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information</ext-link>.</p>
<p>3. We noticed you have some minor occurrence of overlapping text with the following previous publication(s), which needs to be addressed:</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aalas/cm/2018/00000068/00000005/art00005" ns0:type="simple">https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aalas/cm/2018/00000068/00000005/art00005</ext-link></p>
<p>In your revision ensure you cite all your sources (including your own works), and quote or rephrase any duplicated text outside the methods section. Further consideration is dependent on these concerns being addressed.</p>
<p>4. To comply with PLOS ONE submissions requirements, please provide methods of sacrifice in the Methods section of your manuscript.</p>
<p>5. Data availability issue. In your statement you say "All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files", but as we explain in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-faqs-for-data-policy" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-faqs-for-data-policy</ext-link> you should provide the individual data points behind means, medians and variance measures presented in the results, tables and figures, and not just those summary statistics. Please provide these underlying participant-level data in a supporting information file or public repository, taking care not to include identifying information (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long" ns0:type="simple">http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long</ext-link>); if these data cannot be publicly deposited or included in the supporting information, e.g. due to patient privacy, legal reasons, or being provided by a third party, please explain why and explain how researchers may access them. Note that authors should not be the sole named individuals responsible for ensuring data access.</p>

<p>Reviewers' comments:</p>
<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This article investigates the effect of spironolactone on cardiac function and fibrosis after induction of hypertension in a transgenic hypertensive rat model. The authors perfomes an advanced echocardiograpic evaluation assessing global longitudinal strain (myocardial and endocardial) that usually is not evaluated in the animal model.</p>
<p>As the authors report GLS can give more information in particular in HFpEF where ejection fraction is preserved.</p>
<p>The article is well written and the topic is relevant in clinical setting.</p>
<p>There are some suggestions:</p>
<p>- the authors should consider to add echocardiographic data of mass in Table 1:</p>
<p>- the discussion section could be a little bit shortened</p>
<p>- the are two figure 1 and no figure 2</p>
<p>- there are two figure 5 and no figure 4.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This experimental study using a hypertensive rat model showed the reduction of myocardial fibrosis with spironolactone, showing the changes in left ventricular ejection fraction and longitudinal strain from speckle tracking echo.</p>
<p>However, the findings do not provide novel insights as compared to previous studies referred.</p>
<p>Comments</p>
<p>1. The title does not imply the aim and results exactly. The effect of spironolactone should be reflected in the title.</p>
<p>2. Myo-GLS is more sensitive to the myocardial fibrosis, as shown in Fig 5. However, in the mid portion of the myocardium, cardiac fiber may be located in the circumferential positions rather than longitudinal positions. Please explain the discrepancy between functional and pathological behaviors.</p>
<p>3. In addition, the transmural distribution of fibrosis is needed to conclude your findings.</p>
<p>4. This technique may have limitations in reproducibility of strain measurements. The intra- and inter-observers&#8217; variabilities should be clarified.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>6. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ns0:type="simple">what does this mean?</ext-link>).
