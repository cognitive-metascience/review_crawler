<p>Reviewer #1: The definition of chronic cluster headache has been changed in the last ICHD3 classification, increasing the time for relapse period from 1 to 3 months. The authors tested of the Korean cluster headache registry the effect of this modification in order to test the new definition and the clinical featurs of the CCH.</p>
<p>The most relevant observation is that the number of patients with CCH doubles with the new criteria.</p>
<p>The number of patients with CCH vs ECH are much less (176 vs 12) but the authors were able, with the statistical correction to still be able to find some significant diferences between the two populations. In particular they found out that the patients with CCH has higher age and lower CH history vs patients with ECH, they have less nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, and have more comorbidity with migraine. Interestingly the authors did not find any differenced in the population reclassified as CCH with the new criteria, meaning that the patients are probably right classified with the new criteria.</p>
<p>They observed how smoke habit may lead CH to become chronic lathough to clearly significant (probably due to the small numeber of pts).</p>
<p>The limits of the study where well stated.</p>
<p>- It would be interesting in the discussion to speculate if there might be a possible role of chronic pain networks disfunction in both conditions (Colombo B et al Neurol SCI 2015).</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This is the multi-center, prospective study to investigate the clinical feature of chronic cluster headache using the new definition in hospitala in south korea. Overall, manuscript is well written. I cannot identify the major of this study.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: -Please discuss in the limitations the types of biases the findings of this study may be influenced by</p>
<p>-The limitations of the study particularly in regards to the validation of diagnosis needs to be more robust.</p>
<p>-Some revision of the English language is needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diagnosis of ECH (code 3.1.1) and CCH (code 3.1.2) were based on criteria&#8221; is not correct in grammar.</p>
<p>&#8220;huge&#8221; should be avoided in academic writing.</p>
