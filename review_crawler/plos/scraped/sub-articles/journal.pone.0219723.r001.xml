<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript entitled &#8220;Sex-dependent and &#8211;independent transcriptional changes during haploid phase gametogenesis in the sugar kelp Saccharina latissima&#8221; by Pearson, Martins and colleagues overviews transcriptomics work to assess expression changes in male and female gametophytes during vegetative growth and induced gametogenesis. The manuscript is well-written, organized, and represents useful work on a less-studied life stage of a commercially important species. This reviewer has only a few comments that should be addressed prior to publication.</p>
<p>Major comment:</p>
<p>The manuscript lacks some discussion of future studies that can be taken to further address the questions raised. For instance, the authors state that transcription levels alone are limiting (Line 328), and parts of this work are preliminary. Please expand these points and provide new directions to investigate these topics. Would proteomics be important to clarify roles of the INO1 contigs? Could more detailed profiling of flagella-specific genes (using qPCR) be useful to differentiate male and female functions? Please expand on this in relevant discussion sections.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>Line 105. The authors state that vegetative growth conditions were based on initial experiments. Were these unpublished results, or were parameters based on previous growth trials from other studies, or in other kelp species? Please clarify.</p>
<p>Line 125. The reviewer is confused here with regards to biological replicates for sequencing. Combined sample weight is provided but not number of cultured samples (i.e., from multiple sporophytes). Were there at least three biological replicates used per sex per stage?</p>
<p>Line 125. Please provide a citation or procedure for the RNA extraction protocol.</p>
<p>Line 135. This reviewer understands the need to remove sequences from possible contaminants from the analysis, but could filtering for Stramenopile proteins remove important, uncharacterized sequences? If so, please address this point here.</p>
<p>Lines 194-195. Transcriptome shotgun assembly accession numbers GHNM00000000 and GHNM01000000 do not currently link to available data on NCBI (GenBank). This reviewers assumes that this is just not publically available yet. The authors should confirm this.</p>
<p>Line 304. The colon followed by a new sentence is confusing to this reviewer. Please rephrase.</p>
<p>Table 1 (Line 308). Why is there a line separating genes EIF4A and NRT? Please see similar situations in Tables 2 and 3. This is not clearly defined.</p>
<p>Line 324. Table S2 is listed twice here.</p>
<p>Lines 402-403. Please add a colon after &#8220;KEGG gene information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lines 471-480. Please offer some clarification regarding the differential levels of the INO1 contigs. Is there any information regarding the second contig (elevated in F, undetected in M) as a variant that produces a different protein? What was the relationship between these two contigs &#8211; was one an upstream fragment while the other downstream, and could this give the reader additional information to further assess the expression difference? This should be explained in more detail.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Referee&#8217;s comments on</p>
<p>Sex-dependent and -independent transcriptional changes during haploid phase gametogenesis in the sugar kelp Saccharina latissima</p>
<p>The manuscript investigates the molecular aspects of haplodiplontic gametogenesis of the sugar kelp, Saccharina latissimi in the gametophytic phase. The authors used transcriptomic data from four time points during the transition from vegetative growth to gametogenesis. This study is well conceived and will contribute to our understanding of life cycle development involving haplodiplontic stages in Stramenopiles.</p>
<p>The study design is sound, and methods used are appropriate for the set of objectives outlines in the manuscript. The manuscript is well written and organized. Overall the work is interesting and well deserving of publication in the journal.</p>
<p>Below are some general comments for the authors&#8217; consideration.</p>
<p>1. Please consider discussing implications of the study in detail and future investigation that can be done in gametogenesis of Saccharina latissimi and/or other related species with similar life cycle</p>
<p>2. It would be nice if the authors can provide a simplified model for gametogenesis pathways based on previous published systems and this study&#8217;s findings</p>
<p>Figure 5 caption is the longest I have seen in any paper. Please consider revising.</p>
