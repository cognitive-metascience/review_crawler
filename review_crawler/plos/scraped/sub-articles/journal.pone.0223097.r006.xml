<p>1. The sentence containing "and the validity of IQVIA data has been assessed in other  jurisdictions...&#8230;" should include the fact that  these assessments were done within Canada in patients of all ages....  which had been previously requested but  was not added  .Its placement in the Discussion is fine .</p>
<p> Response: Sentence modified as requested. To better reflect the references; it now reads: &#8220;Abstracts validating IQVIA antibiotic databases in other Canadian jurisdictions, performed with patients of all ages, have been previously presented.[32,33]&#8221; </p>
<p>2. The references remain incomplete with several case and alignment errors. Please correct them as previously  requested.. </p>
<p>Response: Two people have independently reviewed the references for errors and they have been corrected</p>
