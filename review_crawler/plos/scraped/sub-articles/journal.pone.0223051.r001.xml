<p>Survival of Infants &#8804;24 months of age with brain tumors: a population-based study using the SEER database</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr Tu,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>The authors&#160;distinguish PNET and medulloblastoma. &#160;I would imagine that PNET refers to supratentorial PNET? Please clarify.</p>

<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Feltermeier et al reviewed the files of 2996 affected children, aged 24 months and younger, with brain tumors from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database between 1973 and 2013. The authors concluded that overall survival for infants with brain tumors has improved from the 1970&#8217;s, with the exception of choroid plexus and embryonal tumors. They present data on &#8220;1) distribution of infantile brain tumors, 2) survival strings for brain tumors by subtype and epoch, and 3) trends in treatment and shifts in therapeutic approaches over time.&#8221; The authors cite their prior work describing the SEER database and add some intrinsic limitations with the SEER database for these specific questions, most importantly the quantification of extent of resection and granular data on outcomes, especially important in pediatrics. Overall this is very carefully thought out work that adds to the literature by stratifying this rare patient population by histological diagnosis, addressing the important improvements in outcomes, correlating with changes of care over time.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this study, the authors used the SEER database to analyze treatment and survival of infants (less than 24 months of age) from 1973-2013. They identified 2996 patients over this time, and analyzed by brain tumor type, decade and treatment. Within the limits of this database, they found improved survival overall, although some tumor types did not show improved survival. In addition, there was decreased use of radiation, except for embryonal tumors. I commend the authors on this large study. I can imagine it would be quite difficult to do this analysis, especially with ever-changing terminology over time. Some of the results can be expected, but this type of analysis is extremely important to have a better overall understanding and perspective of brain tumor treatment over time. In addition, as the authors point out, we need to use contemporary data in doing studies, as outcomes have changed over time. One minor point, they distinguish PNET and medulloblastoma. I would imagine that PNET refers to supratentorial PNET? I would just ask that they clarify. Nice paper.</p>
