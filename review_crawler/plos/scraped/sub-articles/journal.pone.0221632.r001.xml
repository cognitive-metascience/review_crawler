<p>Morphological and Molecular Identification of the Dioecious &#8220;African Species&#8221; Volvox rousseletii (Chlorophyceae) in the Water Column of a Japanese Lake Based on Field-collected and Cultured Materials</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Nozaki,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>I agree with Reviewer 1 about the high quality and overall suitability of this manuscript for publication.&#160; In your revision and rebuttal please respond to the critiques of Reviewer 1 with whom I also agree regarding the last section where the discussion of Spirogyra and Chloromonas seemed out of place, and the need for details of the KOD polymerase method to be elaborated in the Methods section.</p>
<p>One more minor point. In Fig. 1B there are asterisk symbols which are not mentioned in the legend.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Aug 30 2019 11:59PM.

<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes.

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript details the occurrence of Volvox rousseletii in Japan, the first time this species has been recorded outside of Africa. The manuscript is well written and is both concise and clear. The data presented is micrographs of laboratory cultivated asexual colonies, field collected sexual colonies, and phylogenetic analyses deriving from both asexual and sexual colonies (confirming that the sexual colonies do indeed correspond to the associated asexual strains). Overall the analyses are appropriate, the data recording is meticulous, the micrographs are excellent, and the paper should be published.</p>
<p>I have one major comment which should be addressed before publication. While the manuscript title, Abstract, and Introduction emphasizes the characterization of a species thought to be restricted to Africa, the Conclusions section instead emphasizes the challenge of characterizing sexual isolates in culture in Spirogyra and Chloromonas, other algae not previously mentioned. The Conclusions should be revised to address the novelty of this paper, the isolation of V. rousseletii in Japan as emphasized by the title, Abstract, and Introduction. The revised species range for V. rousseletii and availability of fresh cultures is worthwhile and should be emphasized. Similarly, the usage of KOD polymerase, an important methodological detail, should be moved to the Methods.</p>
<p>A few minor comments:</p>
<p>1. Hanschen et al 2018 Evol Eco Res published the psbC and rbcL sequences of Volvox perglobator (accession numbers KY489659 and KY489662), these should be included in Figure 5.</p>
<p>2. Page 5, last paragraph &#8220;Volvox&#8221; should be italicized when introducing VTAC media</p>
<p>3. The implementation of maximum parsimony for phylogenetic analyses is outdated and should be replaced by Bayesian analyses. This analysis can be implemented in MrBayes.</p>
<p>4. Page 9, please do not abbreviate CBCs.</p>
<p>5. Figure 1, the (*) and (b) are not specified in the legend for panels B and C.</p>
<p>**********</p>
