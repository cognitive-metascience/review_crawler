</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Suthar, </p>
<p>On behalf of my colleagues and the academic editor, Dr. Margaret Kruk, I am delighted to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Evaluation of approaches to strengthen civil registration and vital statistics systems: a systematic review and synthesis of policies in 25 countries" (PMEDICINE-D-19-01902R2) has been accepted for publication in PLOS Medicine. </p>
<p>PRODUCTION PROCESS</p>
<p>Before publication you will see the copyedited word document (in around 1-2 weeks from now) and a PDF galley proof shortly after that. The copyeditor will be in touch shortly before sending you the copyedited Word document. We will make some revisions at the copyediting stage to conform to our general style, and for clarification. When you receive this version you should check and revise it very carefully, including figures, tables, references, and supporting information, because corrections at the next stage (proofs) will be strictly limited to (1) errors in author names or affiliations, (2) errors of scientific fact that would cause misunderstandings to readers, and (3) printer's (introduced) errors.</p>
<p>If you are likely to be away when either this document or the proof is sent, please ensure we have contact information of a second person, as we will need you to respond quickly at each point.</p>
<p>PRESS</p>
<p>A selection of our articles each week are press released by the journal. You will be contacted nearer the time if we are press releasing your article in order to approve the content and check the contact information for journalists is correct. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximize its impact. </p>
