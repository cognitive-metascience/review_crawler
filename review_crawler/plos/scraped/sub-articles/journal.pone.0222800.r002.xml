<p>The reviewers comments were mainly addressed by the additional of a supplemental table including all means and standard errors from each sample date.</p>
<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>I have just some minor concerns:</p>
<p>Line 301, &#8220;The effect of time was also significant&#8221;, there is no data to prove this. May be it can be put in the supplementary materials.</p>
<p>A supplementary table was created which includes the mean and standard error for each treatment on each individual sampling date. (Line 303)</p>
<p>Line 315, &#8220;On the second sampling date, densities of RWW immatures were 73% lower in Karate treated plots than in control plots&#8221;. There was also no data to support this.</p>
<p>A supplementary table was created which includes the mean and standard error for each treatment on each individual sampling date. (Line 317)</p>
<p>Line 322-325, &#8220;Three days later, numbers of plants emerged were approximately 10% higher overall&#8221; &#8220;There was no interaction between MJ and time&#8221;. No data support.</p>
<p>A supplementary table was created which includes the mean and standard error for each treatment on each individual sampling date. (Lines 325-326)</p>
<p>Line 331-332,334-335, 338-339, 351-352, 367-368, 376-377, 389-390, 407-412, no data support. Line 355-358,365-367, no data support. Is it possible to put some supplemental tables or figures?</p>
<p>Figure 4 contains much of this data, but was not noted in the text. This has been corrected. Additionally a supplementary table was created which includes the mean and standard error for each treatment on each individual sampling date. (Lines 333-334, 337, 341, 345, 354, 356, 357, 361, 365-366, 370-371, 380,393,415)</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: </p>
<p>I have only a minor suggestion: In the title, &#8220;an herbivore&#8221; could be replaced by &#8220;rice water weevil&#8221;.</p>
<p>This suggestion was included and the title altered</p>
