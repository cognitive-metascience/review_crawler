<p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</p>
<p>Both reviewers recommend minor revision and enjoyed your study. I agree with them. However, please go through their comments and make the suggested changes, or explain why not for those that you do not change.</p>
<p>I have pasted the review letter from Dick Veit, which came directly to me rather than the PLOS ONE site. The other review letter is uploaded below.</p>
<p>In addition to the comments from the reviewers, I also have a few minor comments:</p>
<p>1) You may want to check that the analyses also work with 1970 spring data excluded, as for 1969.</p>
<p>2) Check the k values in Table 2. Why are they so different for similar variables between fall and spring?</p>
<p>3) Please stick to one format for the list of references. You have several varieties, some of which are not normally used in scientific writing (e.g. giving issue numbers, capitalizing all words in an article title, etc.).</p>
<p>Veit's review:</p>
<p>Detailed comments below. I found this to be a very interesting paper, well suited to publication in PLoS One. I think that the use of long-term migration data for estimating population trends has been an underutilized resource, but clearly has its strengths as pointed out by the authors. Migration data are not without limitations (also pointed out by the authors) but especially in combination with BBS and CBC data provide a powerful tool. I like the use of the clustering techniques to try to identify what species cluster together on the basis of population trend, and the results are interesting to a broad audience interested on climate change and its impacts on any organisms &#8211;these results suggest a diversity of species-specific responses ; this broad appeal makes the paper particularly suitable to PLoS ONE (as opposed to an ornithology journal). I am not an expert on state space models but know enough about the approach and feel that the techniques used were appropriate, and interesting in that I have never seen them used in quite this context.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the MBO database on migration is truly extraordinary for its persistence and continuity since 1966, and that in itself lends credibility to the results of this study.</p>
<p>1.) With most species showing significant net declines in at least one season (49/73 species evaluated). How can a species decline in one season?</p>
<p>2.) Because banding stations are typically situated at narrow points in migration Please use different wording here or explain more fully. I think what you mean is that, since, during migration, birds of a variety of species breeding in a variety of localities tend to co-occur at the same places during migration, counts of migrants integrate population trends over broader spatial scales than is possible with censuses of breeding birds. If that is indeed what you mean, then I would emphasize this point more strongly here and in the abstract. Ornithologists have a bias against counts of migrants because they think such counts are too &#8220;messy&#8221;, whereas in some sense the opposite is true.</p>
<p>3.) For a more thorough account of local conditions, see (delete this phrase, top of page 6)</p>
<p>4.) Approval of the work by an ethics committee is not required for catching and banding</p>
<p>birds in the United States. Such requirement is legally determined by the institution concerned; I would delete if I were you!</p>
<p>5.) Because Willow Flycatcher and Alder Flycatcher cannot be separated reliably in the hand. I disagree, and think the evidence is strong that the majority can be identified (Pyle, latest edition). Do you have guesses? If so it seems there are changes going on with both species, and it would be interesting to identify migrants (and dates of migration). As a contrast to your next statement, I suspect that Willow and Alder flycatchers are more reliably separated than are subspecies of Palm Warblers.</p>
<p>6.) (distinguished by physiological signs of breeding</p>
<p>readiness, or hatch-year birds caught on spring migration). What do you mean by a HY bird here - I guess a &lt; 1 yr old bird in may would be SY rather than HY but in a sense it is a &#8220;hatching year bird&#8221;. So you are talking about baby chickadees and the like that you capture during May? My first reaction was that you excluded all SY birds in spring, which I am sure is not true. Maybe phrase a bit more clearly.</p>
<p>7.) Page 7, second to last paragraph. How does excluding captures from outside the peak migration periods affect your results for species whose peak migration periods have changed (some quite substantially, I think)?</p>
<p>8.) being a spruce budworm (Choristoneura sp.) specialist. I wouldn&#8217;t argue with any species previously determined to be a spruce budworm specialist, but what is the basis for saying any given species is not? Might not any passerine nesting in boreal forests benefit from outbreaks of these caterpillars?</p>
<p>9.) What is your basis for saying that any species lacks plasticity in migration strategy? M&#216;ller is a proven fraud; I haven&#8217;t read Both 2010. I am suspicious, and think that most species are fairly plastic, given the &#8220;incentive&#8221; to be.</p>

<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: This is a well thought out paper that analyzes long-term banding data in an effort to determine trends in bird populations. The results and implications of the work are of great value, especially since there are many challenges in the interpretation of data from banding efforts during migration.</p>
<p>Complicating factors related to synthesizing data collected in this manner (e.g. mixing of populations of species from different regions with different population trends, weather patterns related to overall abundance observed as captures at a single location) are discussed sufficiently and effectively. And the fact that results of this study generally reflect population declines documented using different methodologies and study designs, lends support to the authors' conclusions and highlights the importance of publishing this paper in the peer reviewed literature.</p>
<p>A few comments below on how revising and expanding the interpretation of the data could provide additional insight and thoughts for follow up work:</p>
<p>1. A more expanded interpretation of each cluster would be useful. While some discussion of species in each cluster is provided, more detail on the species clustering can provide a better understanding for the reader about what the authors' thoughts are about species composition in each cluster.</p>
<p>2. In addition, are there any characteristics of the species that don't belong in any cluster?</p>
<p>3. There is no concordance in species clustering for spring and fall, and the authors explain that this as the result of potentially the result of sampling different breeding populations in different seasons or species using different migratory routes. While this may not be the broader purpose of the paper, looking at patterns more closely and providing a better in-depth understanding of the discrepancies would be useful.</p>
<p>4. Clusters consist of different number of species (2-9 species). It would interesting to understand if similarities in life history traits may be more strongly reflected in species belonging to larger clusters. In other words, while the lack of similarity in spring cluster 10 (Blue Jay and Wood Thrush) is discussed, are there stronger similarities in the larger groups(for example fall group 1). Do these greatly dissimilar clusters of 2 drive the lack of relation between species affiliation and cluster? That should be further explored.</p>
<p>Thanks for the opportunity to review a very nice project!</p>
