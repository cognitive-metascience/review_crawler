<p>Reviewer #1: The authors try to explore the effect of electric field on enzyme active sites</p>
<p>by exploring the response to field of SOD.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the paper does not present a comparison between calculated and observed values. This includes the argument that the rate changes.</p>
<p>Unless I missed something the paper is compared to some experiments</p>
<p>I cannot see advantage in publication</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The authors present a molecular dynamics simulation study exploring the effect of electric field pulses on the superoxide dismutase protein. There are two main motivations for this study as presented by the authors: (i) to understand the structural stability of the protein in respect to an external electric field and (ii) to explore the possibility that the external electric field modifies the electrostatic guidance, i.e., the local electric potential that drives the superoxide to Cu2+ for the catalytic electron-transfer reaction. The goal (i) was already studied in a number of previous papers and the authors confirm the basic conclusion that sufficiently strong fields lead to partial protein denaturation. Question (ii) is potentially more novel and I believe here the authors' analysis was insufficient.</p>
<p>The authors explore the distribution of the electric field, and its modification by an external pulse, in the vicinity of the active site. The first question to ask here: why should one care about the electric field? The ability of the superoxide to reach the active site should be driven by the potential of mean force, a free energy, and not by the electric field, which provides the force at a local point. I believe the authors are not calculating the property which is critical for the question they have posed. I also have significant questions regarding how the electric field was calculated. The calculation is based on eq 1, which is the Coulomb law in vacuum. The resulting numbers are based on the magnitudes of partial charges and the distances to them. This is clearly not the entire picture. Electrostatic interactions are screened by water. Near the protein surface one cannot simply used the bulk dielectric constant of 78 and one has to specifically calculate the electric field by the water dipoles. However, the crudest estimate suggests that the numbers presented by the authors are overestimated by a factor of ~78. This is clearly not acceptable. In addition, I assume simulations were done in the standard Ewald protocol. Therefore, Ewald corrections have to be used in the calculation of the electric field as well. The calculations presented by the authors have no physical meaning unless these problems are addressed.</p>
<p>It would be useful to have a consistency check for the electrostatic calculations. Can pKa be calculated to make sure the results are solid? None of the plots presented in the paper are testable by observations. The authors should make some minimum effort to connect to the observable reality.</p>
