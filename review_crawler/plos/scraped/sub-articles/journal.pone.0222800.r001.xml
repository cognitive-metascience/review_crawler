<p>1. We note that you have included the phrase &#8220;data not shown&#8221; in your manuscript. Unfortunately, this does not meet our data sharing requirements. PLOS does not permit references to inaccessible data. We require that authors provide all relevant data within the paper, Supporting Information files, or in an acceptable, public repository. Please add a citation to support this phrase or upload the data that corresponds with these findings to a stable repository (such as Figshare or Dryad) and provide and URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers that may be used to access these data. Or, if the data are not a core part of the research being presented in your study, we ask that you remove the phrase that refers to these data.</p>
<p>2. Please include captions for your Supporting Information files at the end of your manuscript, and update any in-text citations to match accordingly. Please see our Supporting Information guidelines for more information: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information</ext-link>.</p>

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript reported the effect of seed treatment with MJ on rice resistance to RWW and on plant growth. The authors found that MJ treatment of rice seeds enhanced plant resistance to larval RWW but reduced plant growth. However, the authors also observed that yields on a per-plant were not significantly reduced by MJ treatment.The work is interesting and show the potential for the use of jasmonate elicitors as part of a pest management program in rice. Overall, the experiments in the manuscript were well designed and the article was well written.</p>
<p>I have just some minor concerns:</p>
<p>Line 301, &#8220;The effect of time was also significant&#8221;, there is no data to prove this. May be it can be put in the supplementary meterials.</p>
<p>Line 315, &#8220;On the second sampling date, densities of RWW immatures were 73% lower in Karate treated plots than in control plots&#8221;. There was also no data to support this.</p>
<p>Line 322-325, &#8220;Three days later, numbers of plants emerged were approximately 10% higher overall&#8221; &#8220;There was no interaction between MJ and time&#8221;. No data support.</p>
<p>Line 331-332,334-335, 338-339, 351-352, 367-368, 376-377, 389-390, 407-412, no data support.</p>
<p>Line 355-358,365-367, no data support. Is it possible to put some supplemental tables or figures?</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this work, the authors studied the effects of methyl jasmonate (MJ) seed treatment on plant resistant to the rice water weevil (RWW) and plant growth in rice under greenhouse and field conditions. It was demonstrated that MJ treatment to seeds enhanced rice resistant to RRW but with a cost, as seedling emergence and heading were delayed and rice biomass was reduced. However, and importantly, they found the yields were not significantly impaired by the MJ treatment. Especially, this work provides useful data of effect of MJ seed treatment in field conditions for two years, and the data include investigations on the effect of MJ treatment, insecticide Karate application, and both, and the duration of MJ effects was also determined. This study is interesting and expands our understanding on the potential application of MJ to seeds as part of a pest management program.</p>
<p>I have only a minor suggestion: In the title, &#8220;an herbivore&#8221; could be replaced by &#8220;rice water weevil&#8221;.</p>
