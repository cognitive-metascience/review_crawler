<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Professor Jones,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Sep 16 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Reviewers' comments:</p>
<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: I enjoyed reading this well-written manuscript and feel that it adds some value to the existing knowledge in physiotherapy education research.</p>
<p>Some comments for the authors to consider:</p>
<p>a) Please indicate n= in the text of Results - currently only percentages are presented.</p>
<p>b) Table 1 - there are no data presented for males under the column labelled 'Action duration 2' - please revise and add.</p>
<p>c) The use of abbreviations introduced into the text is not consistent throughout the different sections of the manuscript - please revise.</p>
<p>d) Grammatical errors:</p>
<p>Line 205 - should be 'professionals'</p>
<p>Line 222 - should be 'therapists'</p>
<p>Lines 230 - 236 - please revise sentence construction and language use</p>
<p>e) Conclusion: consider re-writing in a more concise manner.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Please find below some general comments for consideration. There are also a few minor grammatical errors to note.</p>
<p>The title indicates this is a pilot study; as such the feasibility and next steps in moving to a bigger study are not fully considered in the discussion (there is a line about on time/burden which is helpful).</p>
<p>Conclusion in the Abstract (Line 22) and the main conclusion (line 257) &#8211; it is not quite clear what the term re-evaluation means. Is it responsiveness i.e. whether the HIC is responsive to change following an intervention?</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>line 46 &#8216;receptive&#8217; vs 'receptive to' or 'able to'</p>
<p>Lines 51-54 appear to include the study aims but these seem a bit different to the start of the abstract; consistency and explicit identification of the study aims would be helpful.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Line 75 &#8220;height and weight were self-reported&#8221; Perhaps this should be considered/discussed as a potential limitation to the study, given that frequently there are inconsistencies between self-report and accurate measurement. Physiotherapy students should be able to measure height and weight with minimal equipment/expense but perhaps I am assuming this for all undergraduate programmes.</p>
<p>Line 85 &#8220;instruction provided identify&#8221; Vs &#8220;instruction provided to identify&#8221;</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Line 124 &#8220;she&#8221; vs &#8220;they were&#8221;</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Line 191 &#8220;&#8230;.reverse the tide of &#8230;.&#8221; Please consider use of more scientific language here</p>
<p>Line 209 &#8220;given&#8221; Vs &#8220;as&#8221;</p>
<p>224-225 &#8211; This is not quick clear. What does &#8220;order&#8221; mean; does it mean to request these results from a medical site?</p>
<p>Line 230 &#8220;That the students&#8230;.&#8221; Rephrase the start of this sentence please</p>
<p>233 &#8211; Does this mean the authors will now contact the WHPA with these results, it may be worth considering whether a recommendation can be made at this stage based on a pilot study.</p>
