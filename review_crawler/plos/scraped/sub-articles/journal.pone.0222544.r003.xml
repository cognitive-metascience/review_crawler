<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. If the authors have adequately addressed your comments raised in a previous round of review and you feel that this manuscript is now acceptable for publication, you may indicate that here to bypass the &#8220;Comments to the Author&#8221; section, enter your conflict of interest statement in the &#8220;Confidential to Editor&#8221; section, and submit your "Accept" recommendation.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: All comments have been addressed</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: I Don't Know</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

<p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: I thank the authors for their revisions that adequately addressed my major concerns. I have several additional comments/suggestions to further improve the manuscript for publication.</p>
<p>I appreciate the authors&#8217; clarification regarding the novelty of their study in comparison to prior studies. The authors should add a sentence or two introducing what trail running is as explained in their response to my first comment. They can include aspects such as terrain, running surface, flat vs. hills, carry extra weight, and make a comparison with marathons to help clarify and explain differences in the races.</p>
<p>Throughout the manuscript, the authors should emphasize &#8220;ultra-distance&#8221; when referring to the race rather than &#8220;long-distance&#8221; to distinguish from marathons.</p>
<p>Authors use the words running where in some sentences, race would be the more appropriate word. The sentences can be reworded so that running also fits if the authors prefer to use that word. Page 3 lines 4 and 5 &#8211; &#8220;biomarker injury while running&#8221; or &#8220;biomarker injury during the race&#8221;</p>
<p>Temporal seems to be a more appropriate word than kinetic when describing changes in biomarkers over time. Kinetic refers more to the changes in the rate of something. The authors can consider calculating rates of change at each time point but I don&#8217;t think that would be of any clinical significance.</p>
<p>As some of the authors have previously published on changes in cardiac function during ultradistance racing, do the authors think the reduction in eGFR can be partially explained by cardiac strain? Also, the authors state in the discussion on page 18 line 22 that AKI may be prerenal. Besides extracellular volume depletion, it may be worth mentioning other potential mechanisms such effects on renal blood flow by the sympathetic nervous system, and antidiuresis from vasopressin release in response to stress/pain. May be worth commenting on to build the discussion but not critical.</p>
<p>Page 5 line 3 - As the authors discuss recent trends in increasing race distance in several parts of the manuscript, they should consider using a more recent reference than the one used from 2001.</p>
<p>Page 5 line 2 and line 10 &#8211; fix the use of two vs. 2</p>
<p>Page 5 line 24 &#8211; clarify that &#8220;before and after&#8221; is referring to the race</p>
<p>Page 6 line 3 &#8211; blood and urine samples were also collected before the race.</p>
<p>Did participants exclusively drink water or could some have consumed sports drinks? Might be worth discussing the association with kidney injury and rehydration with sugar sweetened beverages if participants did in fact have access to it.</p>
<p>It is more appropriate to use the word &#8220;chloride&#8221; rather than &#8220;chlorine&#8221; in the text and tables.</p>
<p>Page 12 lines 9-10 &#8211; Myoglobin increased from 34 to 2761, if not statistically significant, this increase may possibly be of some clinical significance. Although not massively elevated, do the authors believe this elevation could have contributed to any reduction in eGFR?</p>
<p>Page 14 lines 12-16 &#8211; Awkward sentence structure. These sentences would benefit from English editing.</p>
<p>Page 18 line 23 - If the hypothesis is that free access to food and water limited the kidney injury, it is safe to say on page 18 lines 12-13 that suggesting dehydration and antidiuresis?</p>
<p>Page 19 line 21 &#8211; ultraendurance races do in fact have considerable effects to kidney function such as, as the authors state, antidiuresis. However, it would be more accurate to state that ultra-endurance races specifically have no impact on acute kidney injury.</p>
