(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: The clinical study was correctly set up, the procedures were well explained and the results correctly presented</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this work authors describe the benefit of MSC based therapy as an approach to cure OA and MPJ in horses. The horses were divided in two group depending on the number of injections received. Authors of this clinical pilot study evaluated the effects of a single/repeated intrarticular administration of allogenic, umbilical cord-derived, neonatal MSCs on osteoarthritis (OA) of a</p>
<p>metacarpophalangeal joint (MPJ) both in term of efficacy (clinical or radiological) than of safety. Results showed that there was no difference between the two group of treatment, but as authors said in the discussion sessions the article is limited by the small numerosity of the cohort.</p>
<p>The study is very well designed and written and it has very interesting results providing important informations both for basic science and clinical science.</p>
