<p>Application of mini-MLST and whole genome sequencing in low diversity hospital extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing Klebsiella pneumoniae population</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Lengerova,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands.&#160;The Academic Editor believes that the manuscript's&#160;remaining&#160;issues with English grammar and use&#160;can be addressed by the authors. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the Editors comments below.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Sep 05 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>*should read "beta-lactamase producing", not plural "beta-lactamases producing"</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>*lines 32, 35, 39, referring to the analysis of core and accessory genes as "core/accessory" is ambiguous in the abstract, please state as "core and accessory" as done elsewhere in the text</p>
<p>Intro</p>
<p>*first 2 sentences are very poorly constructed, please revise</p>
<p>*line 65, suggested wording "of a pre-determined set of.."</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>*lines 133, 134 suggested wording of "aligned nucleotide sites" instead of ambiguous term "positions"</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>*where is Fig 1? I did not see it in the files attached to this paper</p>
<p>*line 175 previous wording is better, suggested wording "(including separation of isolate S13 from other isolates)"</p>
<p>*lines 187 and 190 "average number of different alleles" is more precise language, please revise as appropriate</p>
<p>*Fig3 shows a major topology difference between panels A (core) and B (core and accessory)&#160;in the switching of the position of the MelT281, ST23 isolates and MelT132, ST405 isolates. This should be mentioned.</p>
<p>*line 234 suggested wording "Based on paired sample analysis,..."</p>
<p>*lines 237 to 240 wording is unclear. Do the authors mean "Both the highest SNV values were for pair S39/S40 that had time lapses between samples of 47 days. The next highest SNV values were only 3 SNVs for the core and 5 SNVs for the core and accessory, despite time lapses of up to 90 days." Please revise as appropriate.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>*line 263 suggested wording "Since then, we have observed six MelTs that account for 82.8% of isolates, from a total of 38 MelTs..."</p>
<p>*line 276 instead of "big bacterial populations", suggested wording "large populations of bacteria"</p>
<p>Overall</p>
<p>*Fig2 legend,&#160;Same issue as raised by Reviewer1, is the tree based on number of shared alleles or the sequence similarity in the shared alleles?&#160;Mostly likely, this legend should include "is based on sharing of 2,251 core genome targets." Please revise as appropriate.</p>
