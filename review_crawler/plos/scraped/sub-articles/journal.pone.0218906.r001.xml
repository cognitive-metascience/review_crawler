<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>

<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Saha et al used mouse brain organotypic slice cultures that were oxygen and glucose deprived (OGD) and then treated them with cord blood (CB) or adult peripheral blood (PB). They found that CB CD14+ mononuclear cells (MNCs) protected neurons from OGD-induced death and reduced both microglial and astrocyte activation which was not shown with PB mononuclear cells. The authors showed that the protective effect of the CB MNCs was mediated by secreted factors and did not require cell-to-cell contact with the injured brain.</p>
<p>1. This very interesting data all revolves around the OGD assay. Are there any other in vitro or even in vivo animal assays that could validate this system?</p>
<p>2. Were dose-response experiments performed with the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) to insure that an adequate dose was tested?</p>
<p>3. Were experiments with peripheral blood MNCs added directly onto the slice vs into the medium below performed as they were for the CB MNCs?</p>
<p>4. Also were dose response experiments performed with the CB MNCs that were added directly to the medium?</p>
<p>5. The authors discuss the fact that the commonly employed and most feasible intravenous use of CB may have limitations when trying to correlate results with the direct application OGD assay. Do they believe there is a role for direct intravascular administration of CB into the injured brain?</p>
<p>6. Are there other models as discussed ni #1 above where these CB CD14+ MNCs could be infused IV to more accurately reflect the clinical situation?</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Using in vitro mouse brain organotypic slice cultures after oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) as a model for hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injuries, the authors have investigated the potential of cord blood versus peripheral blood MNC co-culture to protect neurons from OGD-induced death as well as reduce microglial and astrocyte activation. The authors report several novel findings: cord blood is effective at protection while peripheral blood is not; protection seems to be facilitated by secreted factors as direct contact is not required; and the protective effect is associated with CD14+ monocyte fraction. Differential gene expression studies have identified several candidate secreted factors preferentially produced by cord blood monocytes, future experiments may begin to evaluate whether those factors (alone or in combinations) could substitute for the cell-based co-culture protective responses.</p>
<p>The authors should provide additional information regarding the following questions and/or discuss why these points are not directly relevant:</p>
<p>1. Have the authors evaluated peripheral blood CD14+ MNC obtained after G-CSF stimulation/mobilization in their in vitro neuroprotection model (as the monocyte/dendritic cell populations are very different as compared with non-mobilized PBMC).</p>
<p>2. The authors are using murine slice cultures obtained from very young 2-day old pups, which may have unique brain responses that are more &#8220;embryonic&#8221; in nature. Have similar experiments been attempted with samples from slightly older murine brains, to determine if equivalent neuroprotective activity can be observed in this perhaps more clinically-relevant situation?</p>
<p>3. Along the same lines, the current model exposes the sliced cultures to MNC therapy immediately after OGD treatment. Have experiments been conducted to evaluate neuroprotection if MNC therapy is delayed for several hours post-OGD?</p>
<p>4. Were any dose-response experiments above the 25,000 cell level per slice culture performed with the PB-MNC or other cell fractions to assess whether the observed differences in neuroprotective activity could be accounted for by a below threshold phenomena (similar to the CB-MNC dose-response data shown in Figure 1B)? Similarly, were dose-response experiments (above and below 125,000) performed in the below the membrane culture experiments to better assess the indirect secretion neuroprotective activity?</p>
