<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: This is an interesting study that examined an association between role model presence and self-regulation using a large sample. Self-regulation is an important in human development process. Clarifying the relationship between role model presence and self-regulation appears to contribute on future education and the relevant intervention. I found the only two revision points and other two discretionary revision points. I listed them below.</p>
<p>Revision</p>
<p>1. Title, hypothesis, and discussion</p>
<p>The authors can clarify the primary aim of this study and how hopefulness was treated in the study. The title indicates that the primary aim was to test association between role model presence and self-regulation, although the two hypotheses mentioned hopefulness. Also, the discussion focused mostly on role model and self-regulation, rather than hopefulness. If the hopefulness was important for this study, the authors can add their assumption of the significant results for hopefulness in the section of Discussion.</p>
<p>2. Limitation</p>
<p>It is suggested that the authors mention the validity of scales/measures which assessed main variables in this study.</p>
<p>Discretionary revision</p>
<p>1. Title</p>
<p>While the study was part of well-deigned large-scale cohort study in Japan, the present study employed a cross-sectional design. This indicates that the study could not create evidence on direction between exposure and outcome. Therefore, the terms &#8220;shaper&#8221; would not be appropriate. This term problem may apply to the same or similar terms throughout the manuscript. In addition, STROBE guideline (e.g. von Elm et al, BMJ, 2007) recommends the authors to write the study design in the title. The authors can reconsider the title. An example below;</p>
<p>An association between role model presence and self-regulation in early adolescents: a cross-sectional study.</p>
<p>2. Statistical analysis</p>
<p>In the final analysis, it appears that the authors included the variable for hopefulness, like a control variable or a co-variate. If the authors have two clear hypotheses about testing two associations between role model presence and self-regulation and between role model presence and hopefulness, each hypothetical relationship can be separately tested in the different regression models, because each relationship may theoretically have the different potential confounders for which the authors should be adjusted. On the other hand, if the authors want to examine the association between three variables including role model presence, self-regulation and hopefulness, together, structural equation modelling (SEM) would be appropriate as the final modelling analysis.</p>
