<p>The clinical outcomes of Bortezomib-based therapy in Taiwanese patients with multiple myeloma: A nationwide population-based study and a single institute analysis</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr Chen,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>Specifically, I agree that the manuscript should be extensively revised by an english-mother tongue scientific writer.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Sep 14 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Francesco Bertolini, MD, PhD</p>
<p>Academic Editor</p>

<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>2. Thank you for including your ethics statement:&#160; "The NHIRD provides encrypted personal patient information to maintain privacy and provides researchers with anonymous identification numbers associated with relevant claim information, including patients&#8217; sex, dates of birth, medical services utilized, and prescriptions. Patients&#8217; consent is not required for accessing the NHIRD. The Institutional Review Board of TSGH approved this study. Our IRB specifically waived the consent requirement." &#160;</p>
<p>a.Please amend your current ethics statement to include the full name of the ethics committee/institutional review board(s) that approved your specific study.</p>
<p>b.Once you have amended this/these statement(s) in the Methods section of the manuscript, please add the same text to the &#8220;Ethics Statement&#8221; field of the submission form (via &#8220;Edit Submission&#8221;).</p>
<p>For additional information about PLOS ONE ethical requirements for human subjects research, please refer to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-human-subjects-research" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-human-subjects-research</ext-link>.</p>
<p>3. In the Introduction section, we noticed several occurrences of overlapping text with your following previous publication, which need to be addressed:</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167227" ns0:type="simple">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167227</ext-link></p>
<p>In your revision please ensure you quote or rephrase any duplicated text outside the methods section. Further consideration is dependent on these concerns being addressed.</p>
<p>4. We suggest you thoroughly copyedit your manuscript for language usage, spelling, and grammar. If you do not know anyone who can help you do this, you may wish to consider employing a professional scientific editing service. &#160;</p>
<p>Whilst you may use any professional scientific editing service of your choice, PLOS has partnered with both American Journal Experts (AJE) and Editage to provide discounted services to PLOS authors. Both organizations have experience helping authors meet PLOS guidelines and can provide language editing, translation, manuscript formatting, and figure formatting to ensure your manuscript meets our submission guidelines. To take advantage of our partnership with AJE, visit the AJE website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://learn.aje.com/plos/" ns0:type="simple">http://learn.aje.com/plos/</ext-link>) for a 15% discount off AJE services. To take advantage of our partnership with Editage, visit the Editage website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.editage.com" ns0:type="simple">www.editage.com</ext-link>) and enter referral code PLOSEDIT for a 15% discount off Editage services.&#160; If the PLOS editorial team finds any language issues in text that either AJE or Editage has edited, the service provider will re-edit the text for free.</p>
<p>Upon resubmission, please provide the following:</p>

The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This retrospective cohort study was designed to evaluate the characteristics, treatment outcome, and prognostic factors of MM patients who received Bortezomib-based therapy. The study was based on the Taiwan National Health Institute Research Database (NHIRD) and the Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH).</p>
<p>This is an interesting epidemiological study. However, the study is difficult to follow due to poor English language skills.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this work Liu and colleagues report the epidemiology of MM in Taiwan and analyze the outcome of bortezomib-treated MM patients. The study is based on data of Taiwan National Health Institute Research Database (NHIRD) and completed with a single institutional experience.</p>
<p>The work is well written and rationally conducted. Results are convincing and well discussed. The statistical analysis is rationale and adequate to achieve a correct evaluation of data. The study provide some useful information about epidemiology of MM in Taiwan and about the role of bortezomib therapy for the treatment of MM patients.</p>
