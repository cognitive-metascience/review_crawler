(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: The authors report on the temporal changes in kidney injury biomarkers before, during, and after an 80km ultra-distance race. The study was designed and conducted appropriately. The manuscript has potential and can benefit from some improved clarity with the results and associated conclusions. Additionally, the focus of the introduction and discussion can be expanded. A large focus of the introduction and discussion involves the AKI to CKD transition. Although this is a good point to make, the study had short term follow-up. The authors should expand these sections to include other exercise related AKIs, such as from &#8220;regular&#8221; marathons and spin classes. Several studies and numerous case reports have been published within the last few years, notably, one published in PLoS ONE. Additionally, Mansour et al. AJKD 2017, is an impactful study and should be discussed. The authors should add a discussion on the strengths and limitations of KIM-1 and NGAL, including the differences between blood and urine measurement.</p>
<p>Also, the novelty the authors make regarding their study of an ultra-distance race rather than a &#8220;regular&#8221; marathon is probably not as clinically significant as the authors make it out to be. This should be adjusted throughout the manuscript including the last two paragraphs of the discussion.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>The in-text tables and figure legends (pages 8-10) are confusing to follow and should be moved to the proper section according to the journal&#8217;s author instructions. Also, the landscape formatting on the later pages needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Page 4, line 3 &#8211; clarify what the 480,000 runners refers to specifically. Did 480,000 runners complete a marathon in that one year or in 2001, have 480,000 runners completed a marathon at some point in their life?</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Page 5, line 8 &#8211; clarify what medical disease refers to. Is this specifically referring to chronic diseases? What about occasional headache or infections? Only systemic illness?</p>
<p>Page 5, lines 9-10 &#8211; The sentence needs to be rewritten. I believe the authors intent to say that the participants had free access to food and water during and after the race. &#8220;ad libitum&#8221;</p>
<p>The study protocol was approved in 2014, was this the same year the race occurred? The authors should mention the year of the race. At least they mentioned the weather that day.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Page 8 line 12 &#8211; Clarify the sentence to specify mean time of the race is referring to &#8220;mean race completion time&#8221;</p>
<p>Table 1 &#8211; what is &#8220;Trial experience&#8221;?</p>
<p>Page 10, line 18 &#8211; elevated urine creatinine does not necessarily reflect a &#8220;high level of urine concentration&#8221;, which is determined from the measurement of specific gravity or osmolarity. The high urine creatinine may simply be reflective of the higher blood creatinine level. Measurement of urinary osmolarity and electrolytes in stored samples would provide additional insight into kidney function during and after the race.</p>
<p>How much of the rise in serum creatinine during the race is really a true reduction in CrCl vs. and increase in muscle release of creatinine? The authors should comment on this.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see the breakdown of the kidney injury biomarkers by KDIGO AKI stage. Were the biomarkers more elevated in these participants?</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Page 14, line 4 &#8211; Although the authors comment on AKI to CKD transition in other sections, they should specify here safe for &#8220;short term&#8221; kidney function as their study followed patients up to 9 days after the race.</p>
<p>Page 14, lines 6-7 &#8211; This sentence is not accurate, The impact of long-distance running on kidney function has been studied. As mentioned earlier, the Mansour AJKD paper, and others.</p>
<p>Since the authors talk about acute dehydration leading to ATN in the discussion, they should mention that the clinical parameters in table 2 do reflect any clinical evidence of dehydration and supports their finding of no major kidney injury.</p>
<p>Page 15, line 7 &#8211; remove the word &#8220;the&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 15, line 8 &#8211; maybe hyaline and waxy casts are nonspecific but muddy brown urinary casts are not nonspecific and are indicative of tubular injury.</p>
<p>Page 15, lines 14-15 &#8211; the assumption that urine was highly diluted before the race is incorrect. There is no evidence to support this claim. Additionally, what does &#8220;huge fluid consumption&#8221; actually mean?</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The Authors in their interesting work show that transient increase in creatinine is not accompanied to parallel increase of two urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury (uNGAL/uCr and uKIM 1/uCr) (ultra-distance race) in trained athletes during intense physical effort.</p>
<p>Major criticisms</p>
<p>-The Authors show that uNGAL/uCr significantly decreases from baseline to day 9 after the physical effort, however in the discussion they state that &#8220;&#8230;all biomarker variation fully disappeared on day 9...&#8221; and &#8220;&#8230;urine levels of NGAL..were similar at 80 km and at baseline after correction for urine dilution status&#8221;. I believe that the decrease of uNGAL/uCr during the physical effort and at day 9 after the race deserves an appropriate discussion. Do the Authors have any data regarding the physical activity/diet in the short term before (ideally 7-10 days) and after the race ? Furthermore it would be interesting to compare baseline athletes&#8217; uNGAL/uCr with healthy control population . Finally it has been previously reported that uNGAL/uCr increases in athletes after 60 kg ultramarathon ( Clin Chem Lab Med. 2012 Feb 14;50(9):1585-9. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2011-0954), please discuss (different population/analysis method?).</p>
<p>Minor criticism</p>
<p>- eGFR should be reported in Table 2</p>
<p>- I would suggest to report the number of subjects with blood test in Table 2 legend (as done by the Authors in Table 3 legend)</p>
