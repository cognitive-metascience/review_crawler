<p>We did our best to answer yours and the reviewer&#8217;s queries, and in details:</p>
<p>1. The text was edited to meet PLOS ONE's style requirements</p>
<p>2. A lead author for the &#8220;Dat&#8217;AIDS Study Group&#8221; along with a contact email address has been added and the affiliation of the authors added</p>
<p>3. &#8220;Data not shown&#8221; has been removed from the text and a supplementary table has been added, along with a brief explicative sentence (line 245)</p>
<p>4. We tried to speculate more on the reasons why very fast ART initiation could be related with poor retention, see additional sentences lines 220-225. As we were truly surprised by this result, we do come short to find an explanation, and are planning to investigate this in depth.</p>
<p>We are willing to make more modifications if necessary.</p>
