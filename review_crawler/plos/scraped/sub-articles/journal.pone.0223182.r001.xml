<p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript entitled &#8220;Research on multi-1 agent genetic algorithm based on tabu search for job shop scheduling problem&#8221; by Chong Peng et al. proposes a multi-agent genetic algorithm based on tabu search to solve job shop scheduling problem under makespan constraints.</p>
<p>1. The authors presents an algorithm combining tabu search with a MAGA. With benchmark instances, the algorithm proves its improvement in effectiveness.</p>
<p>2. The statistical analysis has been performed with 43 benchmark instances often used to test optimization performance. The results reported a better optimization performance. The authors conclusion sounds credible.</p>
<p>3. The language of the manuscript looks good.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The solution to job shop scheduling problem is of great significance for improving resource utilization and production efficiency of enterprises. In this paper, in view of its non-deterministic polynomial properties, a multi-agent genetic algorithm based on tabu search (MAGATS) was proposed to solve job shop scheduling problem under makespan constraints. Firstly, a multi-agent genetic algorithm (MAGA) was proposed. The paper is well organized and the methods proposed by the authors were verified by the given examples. I can recommend it to be accepted.</p>
