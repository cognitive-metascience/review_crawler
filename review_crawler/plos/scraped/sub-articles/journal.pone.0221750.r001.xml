<p>Reviewer #1: The authors tackled a very challenging subject of the most appropriate antiplatelet medication in secondary stroke prevention. The choice of the most appropriate antiplatelet agent is an unmet need. The literature is varied and makes the option difficult. The new revised stroke guidelines 2018 assumed that the selection of the antiplatelet agent depends on the clinicians&#8217; preference, risk factors, cost, tolerance, and clinical characteristics.</p>
<p>The present scientific work is a retrospective study, including patients from the Taiwan Health Insurance Database. The authors invested a significant effort to compare aspirin with clopidogrel in preventing recurrent vascular events. This was a very thought provoking topic to investigate.</p>
<p>The study is clearly presented and described. The conclusion supported by the results. Nonetheless, there are several limitations that should be addressed and discussed.</p>
<p>1. The authors aimed to demonstrate that aspirin might have better efficacy than clopidogrel in secondary stroke prevention; however, the previous data does not support this conclusion. The findings are not consensus with the previous mentioned study of Lee et al, where the data derived from the same database. Specifically, the authors may wish to comment on how and why the findings are inconsistent with the previous mentioned study.</p>
<p>2. Moreover, the authors should identify more related literature that clarifies and justifies their findings and the controversies over the secondary antiplatelet treatment in stroke patients. Especially, a very recently published meta-analysis of Greving et al (2019) concluded that clopidogrel and aspirin/dipyridamole combination seemed to be the most appropriate choices with a favorable balance between efficacy and safety. Another previous review of the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register and the Antithrombotic Trialists' database concluded that the thienopyridine derivatives (ticlopidine and clopidogrel) are modestly but significantly more effective than aspirin in preventing serious vascular events in patients at high risk (and specifically in TIA/ischemic stroke patients)(Hankey et al 2000).</p>
<p>3. Additionally, the authors referred that the CAPRIE study failed to show a better efficacy of clopidogrel compared to aspirin; however the CAPRIE trial was not designed to determine whether clopidogrel was superior or equivalent to aspirin among stroke patients.</p>
<p>4. The authors mentioned that diabetic patients have higher rates of high on treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) on clopidogrel and that could be associated with increased risk of MACE. The authors should include more information about the non-responsiveness of antiplatelets in stroke patients with diabetes mellitus. There are many scientific reports indicating higher rates of non-responsiveness to both antiplatelets (aspirin and clopidogrel) in diabetic patients and higher rates of recurrent strokes. In addition, as the authors referred to genes associated with HTPR on clopidogrel, a recent popular view is the potential relation of genetic factors with the prevalence of HTPR in both antiplatelets. There are many studies in the literature on that subject. It is also noteworthy, the black box warning from the US Food and Drug Administration that recommends patients to be tested for the possibility of reduced efficacy of clopidogrel in individuals carrying the CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function allele.</p>
<p>5. While the study appears to be sound, the language is unclear at some points, making it difficult to follow. There are some minor elements of grammar that would improve the article&#8217;s presentation. In the abstract, on page 2, line 38 &#8220;in 2000-2012&#8221;, the word &#8220;between&#8221; may work better. In the same page, line 46 &#8220;inclusion/exclusion criteria&#8221;, the sentence &#8220;patients on aspirin or clopidogrel who met the inclusion criteria&#8221; may work more effectively. On page 4, line 88 the authors should include references of trials comparing the efficacy of aspirin with clopidogrel. On page 5, line 133 referring to the primary outcome including all cause of hospitalization, the authors may wish to consider stating what cause of hospitalization they meant. On Table 1, there is a missing abbreviation for the CVA. At many points in the article, MACE refers to both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Lastly, the authors should revise the language in the section of &#8220;Conclusions&#8221; at page 13 to improve readability.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The study conducted by Vidyanti et al. had a retrospective design and aimed to evaluate the effect of clopidogrel when compared to aspirin on a combined clinical outcome &#8211; Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE).</p>
<p>The data provided by the author partially support their conclusion. This is a retrospective cohort study and the results should provide insights for another type of design, if relevant for specific population/ethnicity. The chosen design has limitations regarding biases and confounding variables prevented definite conclusions regarding drug efficacy.</p>
<p>The authors stated that all relevant data are within the manuscript and the statistical analysis was performed properly using Propensity score matching, a technique which minimize differences between two groups. This statistical tool was associated with conditional Cox proportional hazards regression for the same purpose.</p>
<p>The manuscript was written in an intelligible fashion and using standard English.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>1. How was ischemic stroke defined to qualify as an event in the retrospective cohort?</p>
<p>2. Regarding the inclusion criteria, specify the generic name of the substance (e.g., say &#8220;combination of Aspirin and Dipyridamole&#8221; instead of &#8220;Aggrenox&#8221;, &#8220;Cilostazol&#8221; instead of &#8220;Pletaal&#8221;). It is better to be consistent, as the other drugs were described using generic names.</p>
<p>3. In the lines 83 and 84 of introduction the authors state that Major Adverse Cerebrovascular Events include death, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, bleeding, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, and cardiovascular hospitalization. The definition of MACE usually varies from study to study.</p>
<p>4. In the Outcome session, the authors chose MACE as they defined previously, but they included all causes of hospitalization instead of cardiovascular hospitalization. Please clarify.</p>
<p>5. The authors defined Major Adverse Cerebrovascular Events as including death, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, bleeding, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and cardiovascular hospitalization. I would suggest a detailed description of each component of MACE that make it possible to classify the events.</p>
<p>6. It should be interesting to see the results of the comparison if we include the three most classical MACE events: 1) any type of stroke, including non-fatal primary intracranial hemorrhage; acute myocardial infarction; or death from any cause, including fatal bleeding. In this way the MACE events still will give us an idea of efficacy and safety. It is possible that the higher MACE rates found in the present study compared to other studies are due to a broader definition regarding MACE outcomes.</p>
<p>7. This analysis, including many types of MACE, might have increased the number of factors not related to atherosclerosis that could explain the outcomes considering what was included; for example, all causes of hospitalization.</p>
<p>8. Regarding the MACE events the authors included all-cause of bleeding. Which exact type(s) of bleeding was identified? It would be interesting to specify different types of bleeding separately as part of the safety profile. For instance, the authors only reported rates of intracerebral hemorrhage in table 2. The authors included all causes of bleeding as major cardiovascular events.</p>
<p>9. Is &#8220;recurrent stroke&#8221; the same as &#8220;recurrent ischemic stroke?&#8221; Please specify. The same for death; was it all causes of death or only cardiovascular death? Please specify.</p>
<p>10. There is missing report of adverse events regarding aspirin and clopidogrel groups.</p>
<p>11. In a subgroup analysis of the CAPRIE study, the diabetic population benefits more from clopidogrel compared with non-diabetic (Relative Risk Reduction of 13.1% in favour of clopidogrel versus 8.7% overall). However, the authors proposed that the higher proportion of patients with diabetes in the study might explain the findings.</p>
<p>It is also worth to address that there is evidence against this explanation (see above) and clopidogrel showed even more benefit compared to aspirin in higher risk population as per hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, previous coronary bypass surgery, history of more than 1 ischemic event and multiple vascular beds involvement in CAPRIE study. It is possible that higher prevalence of diabetes in the present study is not what has driven the results in favor to aspirin as raised in the discussion.</p>
<p>12. What was the average period of time that patients were on medication in each group?</p>
<p>13. One limitation is that if patients used aspirin or clopidogrel for less than one year and the MACE was calculated within one year, then it is likely that the patient was not under drug protection/effect anymore at the time that some MACE occurred.</p>
<p>Additional suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Line 95 : &#8220; In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy of clopidogrel with aspirin with MACE included to assess safety between groups based on real-world evidence form the&#8230;&#8221;. Did the authors mean &#8220;In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of clopidogrel compared to aspirin with MACE included to assess safety between groups based on real-world evidence...&#8221; ?</p>
<p>2. Table 1. Hospitalization days &#8211; median (interquartile range). There is no range demonstrated. Please clarify variable used</p>
<p>3. &#8220;HPR of clopidogrel could also be associated with increased risk of MACE.&#8221; Clarify this sentence. Did the authors mean HPR on clopidogrel treatment&#8230;</p>
