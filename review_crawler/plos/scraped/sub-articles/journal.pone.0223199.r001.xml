<p>Additional Editor Comments:</p>
<p>This manuscript presented a retrospective pathology-based case-control study which investigates whether there is association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The study did not find a statistically significant association between AD and AMD and suggested that any shared characteristics between the two disease may be nondeterministic. This work received favorable review from expert reviewers and minor revision is recommended to address the issues raised by the reviewers.</p>

<p>Reviewers' comments:</p>
<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Partly</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: I Don't Know</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This is study on a very important question in the field of neurodegeneration both for AMD and for Alzheimer.</p>
<p>The study is rather well done and the literature review and context placement is very well done. The authors note the limitations very well which are unavoidable in a study fo this nature that requires Brian and eye autopsy specimens. Thus despite the limitations this study adds significantly to our knowledge.</p>
<p>One eadditional control that may be added is that of a the AMD prevalence in a cohort of controls patients form the electronic data record with the same demographics as the AD autopsy group to cover for the imbalances noted by the authors in their control group. Of course this will have its own limitations but it will be nice t know this information if possible.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This paper is a clearly written description of a methodologically rigorous study on an important topic. As the authors outline, the use of often elusive histopathological diagnoses makes this paper an impactful contribution to the field. It contains sufficient statistical information in general (though I wonder why the test statistic was given for chi-squared tests but not for t-tests), and thoughtful reflection in the discussion. I commend this write up as an excellent example of being as close to publication-ready as a submission can be. Well done!</p>
<p>- On page 15, line 310, change "Alike..." to "Like..." or similar.</p>
<p>- Some figures - if cost and space allow, which they may not - of examples of the histopathological findings would be engaging. Not essential.</p>
<p>- In the section, at the end of pages 14 and beginning of page 15, on the lack of shared polymorphisms between AMD and AD, consider citing this: Am J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2015 Dec;23(12):1290-1296. doi: 10.1016/j.jagp.2015.06.005 Its of direct relevance but my knowledge of this paper is because I am one of the authors, so clearly have an interest to declare on this point! The authors may well be aware of this paper and have decided against citing it, which is obviously fine. I also declare that I am the first author cited in reference 10.</p>
