<p>Academic Editor,</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>PONE-D-19-16142R1</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter on Aug 23, 2019 regarding this manuscript. We would also like to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments. We are now submitting a revised version as detailed below that addresses these comments (original comments from reviewers and the editor are in italics). All changes have been indicated in red in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Response to Reviewer#2:</p>
<p>Forearm sensitive nerve distrubution is important in terms of donor area selection and flap choices so I think your manuscript will be usefull for the scientists dealing with this subject. However terminology is important as well so all "anastomosis" words must be replaced with coaptation or neuroraphy.</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>Thank you for your positive comment. According to your comments, we have replaced "anastomosis" with coaptation.</p>
<p>Response to Editor:</p>
<p>We have revised the text in accordance with the comments of the reviewers. </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shengbo Yang</p>
