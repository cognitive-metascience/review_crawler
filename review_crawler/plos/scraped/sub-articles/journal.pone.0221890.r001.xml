<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Dear Editor, the paper PONE-D-19-16398 by Munoz-Lozano and co-workers deals with a very important topic in forensic entomology especially when wildlife is considered.</p>
<p>experimental design, number of replicates and the statisics applied are sound and very well developed.</p>
<p>Only few minor observations to improve the text:</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>Add the Authority and the year of description of all the species (vertebrates as well) when reported the first time</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>-add a sentence indicating that as well some work on microbiome of wild animals has been performed (eg.: Tuccia F, Zurgani E, Bortolini S, Vanin S Experimental evaluation on the applicability of necrobiome analysis in forensic veterinary science. Microbiologyopen. 2019 Mar 12:e828. doi: 10.1002/mbo3.828)</p>
<p>line 37, mention as well the very important book published by M. Eric Benbow, Jeffery K. Tomberlin, Aaron M. Tarone in 2018 (Carrion Ecology, Evolution, and Their Applications)</p>
<p>line 38 add "and veterinary" after medicolegal</p>
<p>line 51 add "or coancealed" after [2]</p>
<p>line 55 affect may be better than condition</p>
<p>line 58 add "being" at the end of the line</p>
<p>line 62 delete "Forensic" at the beginning of the sentence</p>
<p>line 63 add "of" after surrogate</p>
<p>M&amp;M</p>
<p>-add a space between the degree symbol and C</p>
<p>line 100 add as well the max and minimum temperature</p>
<p>line 131 bette 600 m than 0.6 Km...in the whole paragraph you are using m as unit</p>
<p>lines 200 and 203 check the way in which the references are cited (apex)</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>line 272 vulgaris not vularis</p>
<p>line 352 change similar with related</p>
<p>line429 add to the reference 67 as well Bugelli et al., Decomposition pattern and insect colonization in two cases of suicide by hanging Forensic Sci Res. 2018; 3(1): 94&#8211;102. doi: 10.1080/20961790.2017.1418622</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: It is an interesting manuscript related with carrion ecology. Contribution is original and worthy of publication in PLoS ONE. The authors discuss about most of the weaknesses of experiment. I would like to suggest some additional corrections.</p>
<p>1. Could provide (maybe in appendix) detailed data (GPS coordinates) for particular exposed experimental carrions? Small scale differences in carrion exposition may have very strong impact on insect succession. Sometimes it is stronger than between distant locations but where carrions are exactly in the same habitats and with the same abiotic conditions.</p>
<p>2. Experimental fox carrion was not eaten by vertebrate scavengers (except golden eagle). However authors noticed many incidents of visiting of experimental carrion by many vertebrate species. Could you describe this contact with more details? Has any physical contact with carrion occurred (jerking, moving etc.)?</p>
<p>3. I have some hesitation related to quite low number of repetitions in the experiment. The information about detailed position of particular experimental carrions (suggested above) may tell us that material from each carrion is really comparable to others.</p>
<p>4. I&#8217;m not sure (in contrary to authors&#8230;) that evisceration of carrion is without serious influence on the insect succession. Did authors do any tests for comparison of insect succession for eviscerated vs. eviscerated fox carrion? If not, it should be mentioned in the text.</p>
