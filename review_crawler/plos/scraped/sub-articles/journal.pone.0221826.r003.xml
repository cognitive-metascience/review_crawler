<p>Genome wide genetic dissection of wheat quality and yield related traits and their relationship with grain shape and size traits in an elite &#215; non-adapted bread wheat cross</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Kumar,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Sep 05 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>

<p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

<p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: As requested, the authors have (i) adequately defended the questions posed on sample size and the number of site-year combinations included; (ii) corrected the discrepancy between Table 1 and Fig. 1; and (iii) improved the grammar.</p>
<p>I therefore maintain my original opinion that the paper is well worthy of publication.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, below I include additional modifications to the grammar, those that I have managed to identify in the time available:</p>
<p>Personally, I would generally replace &#8220;QTL&#8221; with &#8220;QTLs&#8221; where it is used in the plural, but do not insist since papers vary in this respect.</p>
<p>The following are more specific modifications suggested to particular lines in the manuscript:</p>
<p>l. 56: insert &#8220;the&#8221; after &#8220;while&#8221;.</p>
<p>l. 59: insert &#8220;it&#8221; after &#8220;although&#8221;.</p>
<p>l. 60: replace &#8220;they do&#8221; with &#8220;does&#8221;.</p>
<p>l. 61: insert &#8220;with them&#8221; after &#8220;loci&#8221;, insert &#8220;A&#8221; before &#8220;major&#8221;, insert &#8220;the&#8221; before &#8220;Rht8&#8221; and insert &#8220;the&#8221; before &#8220;reduced&#8221;.</p>
<p>l. 62: replace &#8220;increase&#8221; with &#8220;increases&#8221;.</p>
<p>l. 97: replace &#8220;more&#8221; with &#8220;a greater&#8221;.</p>
<p>l. 259: insert &#8220;The&#8221; before &#8220;same&#8221;.</p>

<p>l. 299: replace &#8220;effect&#8221; with &#8220;effects&#8221;.</p>
<p>l. 314: replace the phrase with &#8220;The majority (52 out of 60) of these QTL&#8221;.</p>
