<p>1. Address format corrected</p>
<p>2. overlapping text. I believe this was corrected by adding the appropriate reference</p>
<p>3. Rather than geographic coordinates, Township/Range/Section was added for each field collection.</p>
<p>4. We don't need repository information. The relevant data is included in our submission.</p>
<p>5. VT description expanded and references added.</p>
<p>6. VT phenotype variation was also added</p>
<p>7. CTV genotyping. This study was not to differentiate CTV genotypes, rather, to screen CTV isolates efficiently for potential severe phenotype which has a VT genotype. </p>
<p>8. Immunocapture. Yes, the CCTEA screens CTV samples from infected trees with MCA13 monoclonal antibody and extracts from MCA13-positive samples are sent to my ARS lab for molecular genotyping by RT-qPCR with strain discriminating primers/probes and selected isolates are biocharacterized in a virus index using graft inoculation to a citrus host range. </p>
<p>9. Warghane et al 2017 was mentioned in the introduction of the original submission and is still there.</p>
