<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear DR Khairy,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>In particular, a number of issues pertinent to the rationale of the study (Reviewer 1 - 1b) and the specifics on study groups utilized need to be included. This is in addition a number of other issues identified by both reviewers.&#160;</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Sep 10 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future.

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Partly</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: The paper entitled: &#8220;Phylogenic classification and virulence genes profiles of uropathogenic E. coli and</p>
<p>diarrhegenic E. coli strains isolated from community acquired infections&#8221; characterizes a number of E. coli isolates from diarrheal and urinary infections.</p>
<p>The main problems that I find in this paper are:</p>
<p>a) Virulence factors such as siderophores or adhesins, hemolysins, etc. are very common in commensal E. coli and it is not surprising that many DEC also have these genes. Having these genes doesn&#8217;t mean that the bacteria are UPEC. UPEC virulence is thought to be a multigenic phenomenon and describing all the potentially virulence genes is not very relevant.</p>
<p>b) It is not clear how they obtained the EAEC isolates; if they obtained from fecal cultures is very odd that all diarrheic samples were positive to EAEC. Normally you obtain 5-20% of different DEC pathotypes. If strains were obtained from a collection, why the authors concentrate in EAEC and ignore DEC pathotypes?</p>
<p>c) Study group is not described either for UTI patients nor for diarrhea patients.</p>
<p>d) Many reports have shown that some intestinal pathotypes (DEC) can also cause urinary infection DAEC and EAEC, it is not a novel finding.</p>
<p>e) The association of some DEC or UPEC strains in this study with Clermon&#8217;s phylogenetic groups is not uncommon. Virulence genes are transferred horizontally.</p>
<p>Minor problems:</p>
<p>a) The manuscript contains many grammatical errors.</p>
<p>b) The discussion section is too long</p>
<p>c) Figures showing distributions of strains in Clermon&#8217;s phylogenetic groups are unnecessary.</p>
<p>d) Lines 39-41 text improvement is needed</p>
<p>e) 107-126 Confidence intervals 95% are not reported for frequency data. There is not p value reported next to percentage of positiveness.</p>
<p>f) Table 2 and table 3 could be join in one.</p>
<p>g) 149-151 Use UPEC instead of ExPEC because you are working only with urine infections associated isolates.</p>
<p>h) 159 Country names must be written with uppercase</p>
<p>i) 157-161 Improve English writing</p>
<p>j) The format of bibliographical references should be checked</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Interesting article. It brings information that can be taken into account in future studies and analysis at a global level. Evaluations within the framework of general data are, however, rather geared towards parts of the globe and less in Europe (eg could be seen <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://doi.org/10.1155/2019/5712371" ns0:type="simple">doi.org/10.1155/2019/5712371</ext-link>). Please review the English language. I've seen some errors to mention just one (page 4, 77, enteroaggragative). Please review the bibliography - it is not unitary written.</p>
