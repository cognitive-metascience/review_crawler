<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript is of interest providing some interesting data on the evolution of biomarkers of endothelial function and inflammation, but many concerns are present.</p>
<p>General comments: The manuscript is very difficult to read with a tendency to be confused. Statistical analysis must be reviewed by a specialist.</p>
<p>The abstract must be reviewed. The methods and results are not clear and the conclusion I is not really conclusive. Word (completely between the brackets is not a good idea in a scientific paper.</p>
<p>Ref 3 is of no interest and must be removed.</p>
<p>In methods part, the timing of blood samples collection must be more precise. First the vintage of collection must be given for all the patients. Second, the timing of collection regarding the dialysis s&#233;ance must be precise, first, second or third dialysis of the week. Third, for the biomarkers, how the sample were conserved? All the measurements were done at the same time? Did the authors have data on the effects of blood conservation on the concentration of the biomarkers?</p>
<p>For others biological value the technique of dosage must be provide.</p>
<p>Finally, the kidney transplantation protocol is very different with three patient included in a randomized trial. I think these patients must be excluded. The values, especially for inflammation markers are very difficult to interpret when one a small sample of patients (15) you have 3 with monotherapy with tacrolimus, 5 with tacro and MMF and 7 with Tacro MMF and corticoids. It is not clear for me for patients with everolimus if they are still with everolimus or not.</p>
<p>Pour les dilyser penser &#224; discuter les diff&#233;rentes membranes.</p>
<p>In results,</p>
<p>In table 1, the authors must separate HD and PD patients. In controls and CKD5-ND it is not residual urine outpout but diuresis. In this table, in the 18% of patient with CKD have a history of Ktx, did they have an immunosuppressive drugs? This must be stated and clear in the characteristics of the patients. It is very different to study endothelial dysfunction to have or not IS drugs.</p>
<p>Important clinical data are missing: tobacco, alcool, lipids concentration, calcium phosphore bicarbonate potassium, hb etc. Medications used, mainly immunosuppressive drugs and corticoids, antihypertensive drugs, HMG CoA inhibitors, anticoagulants, aspirin etc. All this drugs could play an important role on endothelial function and inflammation.</p>
<p>For the table 2, supplementary analysis separating HD and PD must be done. Adjustment with blood pressure could be of interest mainly regarding endothelial dysfunction.</p>
<p>For the longitudinal analysis we must have separation of PD and HD patients. In addition, in my opinion for dialysis patient regarding the boxplot there is no real differences in all the biomarkers, the test used for statistical significance must be provide explicitly in the results. More interesting than a box blot the authors must provide individual courses of the biomarkers separating HD and PD.</p>
<p>We must have comparisons with other biological values, like calcium phosphore, bicarbonate urea, creatininemia etc.</p>
<p>For transplantation patients same remarks regarding the representation of data. It could be of interest to indicate the course of values for the 4 patients undergoing dialysis then transplantation the data.</p>
<p>The additional analysis section is a non sense. All this analysis must be included with main analysis or not discusses. The patients with cyst infection must be definitively excluded.</p>
<p>The discussion will be analyzed after the modification asked for the methods and results.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In the present study, the authors compared biomarkers of endothelium dysfunction and low-grade inflammation in controls and in different groups of CKD patients. They show that most biomarkers are higher in CKD patients than in controls, higher in dialysis patients than in non-dialyzed patients and decline after kidney transplantation. Higher levels of serum biomarkers of ED and LGI in CKD patients have been previously shown in the literature. In addition, the data on serum biomarkers after kidney transplantation do not provide new informations and only confirm previous studies.</p>
<p>1) The design of the study is complex. It mixes the data of three separate observational studies, but the number of subjects per group is quite low. The characteristics of CKD5-ND and CKD5-D patients are different in terms of origin of end stage renal disease, and presence of diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p>2) Patients on PD are different from patients on HD (younger, less CVD history, higher residual GFR&#8230;), and additional analysis demonstrated differences in biomarkers in these two groups of patients. Therefore,the authors should not include these patients in the same CKD5D group.</p>
<p>3) The choice of statistical analyses is not clear. Why do the authors compare the data of biomarkers between groups with linear regression analysis and not with tests for group comparison like ANOVA or Mann Whitney? In addition, why do the authors use a natural log transformation to perform statistical test on the levels of serum biomarkers? How is the distribution of the data (normal or not)?</p>
<p>4) Identical data are presented several times, in different figures/tables. For example, Figure 2 and Table 3 provides the same informations, data in Table 3 are also in S1 Table etc&#8230;</p>
<p>5) For a better understanding, the authors should add the symbols of p values on figures and tables. In particular, the p values between CKD5-ND and CKD5D should be mentioned in Table 1.</p>
<p>6) In table 3, an entire column is NA, please remove the column. In S1 Table, dialysis vintage and KT/V are NA, please remove the lines.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: Manuscript is well written. Only minor suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>Please try to avoid the use of () in the descriptive sentences in academic writing &#8220;This risk is not (completely) mitigated by renal replacement therapy&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only data of their first study was analyzed&#8221; &#8220;of&#8221; should be &#8220;from&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, I suggest the investigators to may improve the introduction/discussion by going over very nice review on this topic PMID: 30607032 Nat Rev Nephrol. 2019 Feb;15(2):87-108. doi: 10.1038/s41581-018-0098-z</p>
