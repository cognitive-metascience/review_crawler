<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Koide,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Aug 08 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available.

<p>In your revised cover letter, please address the following prompts:</p>
<p>a) If there are ethical or legal restrictions on sharing a de-identified data set, please explain them in detail (e.g., data contain potentially sensitive information, data are owned by a third-party organization, etc.) and who has imposed them (e.g., an ethics committee). Please also provide contact information for a data access committee, ethics committee, or other institutional body to which data requests may be sent.</p>
<p>b) If there are no restrictions, please upload the minimal anonymized data set necessary to replicate your study findings as either Supporting Information files or to a stable, public repository and provide us with the relevant URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers. For a list of acceptable repositories, please see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories</ext-link>.</p>

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: The authors explored the important effects of inoculum dispersal and plant species identity on community assembly of endophytic fungi. The study design is appropriate, as are the methods used, the paper is well-written and therefore I think it deserves publication in PLoS One.</p>
<p>Only three minor comments:</p>
<p>1. The letter &#8220;P&#8221; (P value) should be italic in Table 1, Table 4, Line 148, Line 164, Line 224, Line 232, Line 234.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;sp&#8221; should not be written in italic (Line 204-208, Line 218, Line259-274, Table 3)</p>
<p>3. In discussion, it would be appreciated if authors can cite of the major drawbacks encountered in this study and cite some of the future works.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This manuscript investigated the effects of both plant identity and fungal inoculum dispersal limitation on endophytic fungal community structure in leaves of six plant species in the eastern Great Basin of the USA, which are interesting. I have some minor comments and suggestions before publication:</p>
<p>Materials and methods:</p>
<p>Ln 95-102: You should give more information about the plots, for example, how did you establish the plots? and the distance among plots. In addition, it is unclear how many samples were actually sampled and sequenced. 18 replicated plots, and for each plot, a single sample for each of the six plant species, so 108 samples were collected and sampled? You should state clearly here.</p>
<p>Ln 106-107: How did you test the effectiveness of surface sterilization? Did you collect the sterile water used in the rinse and do the PCR or just culture on medium?</p>
<p>Ln 116: 5.8S Fun and ITS4 Fun</p>
<p>Ln 128-131: Why did you rarefy the samples prior to all sequence analyses? I saw the Figure S1, the sequence depth is 3000. So this step is the same with or different from the rarefaction you mentioned in Ln 141-142?</p>
<p>Ln136-Ln139: You amplified the ITS2 region using the 5.8S Fun and ITS4 Fun. Generally, some studies will extracted ITS before the OTU cluster, Why did not you do that? In addition, did you check the chimera? What was the proportion of chimeric sequences?</p>
<p>Ln 140: What was the proportion of your ITS sequences belonged to the host in each sample?</p>
<p>Have authors deposited sequences to a public repository? You should state in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>Ln 174: How many raw data were obtained for each sample? And how about the reads for each sample before rarefaction?</p>
<p>L173-176: Maybe it is better to add some description about the fungal taxonomic composition in the first paragraph. You should provide a supporting information about your fungal identification.</p>
<p>Ln 215: Please cite the "Table 3" behind "among plant families"</p>
<p>Table 3: I think this table does not show the information visually. Maybe you can colored the cell of the table according to the frequencies of occurrence, like a heatmap.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>Ln 317-318: Are there any other publications describing the 18 fungal taxa colonizing leaves of other plant species? And are there publications showing these fungal taxa contribute to the host health and development? Maybe you can add some discussion about this.</p>
