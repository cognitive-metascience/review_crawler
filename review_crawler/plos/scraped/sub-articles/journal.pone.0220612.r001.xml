<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr Wong,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Aug 02 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future.

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Partly</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This study was performed by a group of experts, aiming to utilize a nationally representative U.S. clinical laboratory database to evaluate prevalence of advanced fibrosis using a systematic algorithm of non-invasive fibrosis biomarker (FIB-4) and to evaluate the impact of metabolic co-morbidities on odds of advanced fibrosis. The findings are important. It would be even nice to improve the quality of figures by using colour figures of higher resolution.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The Authors conducted the retrospective study aiming to evaluate prevalence of advanced fibrosis and to evaluate the impact of metabolic co-morbidities on odds of advanced fibrosis based on a large-scale database. They found that the prevalence of advanced fibrosis ranged from 6.18% - 9.07%, and the prevalence of F4 fibrosis/cirrhosis ranged from 3.91% &#8211; 5.35%. They concluded that co-morbid metabolic abnormalities were associated with higher risk of advanced fibrosis among NASH patients. Although the study touched the important issue indicating the parallel association between disease severity and metabolic abnormalities in NAFLD patients, some points need clarification.</p>
<p>1. The definition of NAFLD/NASH in the current study was based on the ICD 9/10 diagnosis coding. The validation of the diagnosis should at least be performed to its best. The exclusion of alcoholism, pregnancy-related fatty change could be the confounding factors.</p>
<p>2. The Authors used FIB-4 as the non-invasive serum panel for fibrosis assessment. The performance could be validated by APRI.</p>
<p>3. Hypertension is one of the main components of metabolic abnormalities. How come the results if the diagnosis coding of hypertension were added to enhance the accuracy of metabolic syndrome in the current study.</p>
<p>4. The conclusion depicted "prevalence of NASH ..., representing 6.80 million and 4.01 million, respectively." , which could not be sufficiently supported by the results. A mild form is suggested.</p>
