<p>Reviewer #1: Dear Editor,</p>
<p>The article is deal with the inhibitory effect of black seed on the formation of heterocyclic amines in meatball. The topic is interest and the article is good and easy to follow. It can be published in your journal after done necessary corrections. My specific comments and questions about the article are below.</p>
<p>- The author should use black cumin or Nigella sativa throughout the article.</p>
<p>- Title: The title of the article should be &#8220;Inhibitory effects of black cumin on the formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines in meatball&#8221;.</p>
<p>- Page 2, line 31: significantly reduced? Give P values in statistical analysis.</p>
<p>- Page 4, line 98-99: No need to this sentence, repetition for the above stated sentence (line 83-84).</p>
<p>- Page 6, line 143: blind or blank?</p>
<p>- Page 7, line 151: distilled water or purified water?</p>
<p>- Page 15, line 349-350: What do you mean? This sentence is not clear.</p>
<p>- Page 16, line 377: Give the references.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The paper is very interesting. From chemical point of view, there is nothing new, just another scenario of Maillard reaction. The data are brief and clear. The paper is well written. And it includes the relevant literature. It seems from the data presented that the black cumin can prevent the formation of genotoxic mutagenic amines to some extent. Taking into account nutritional aspects, it is a valuable finding. Therefore, I recommend the present study to be published as it is.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: In my opinion this manuscript may be published in PLOS ONE only after a major revision. Generally, English must be improved. In this study, the Authors estimated the effect of use of black cumin in meatball preparation on formation of HAAs. In my opinion, it would improve a paper a lot if the Authors added (e.g., in introduction) any information about black cumin as a source of antioxidants. Beside essentiale oil containing mainly carvone and limonen, black cumin seeds may contain also phenolic acids (e.g., caffeic acid), flavonoids, leuco-anthocyanins that may have a crucial role in scavenging of free radicals. The last ones may be responsible for formation of HHAs.</p>
<p>The remaining comments to the Authors are given below.</p>
<p>Page 3 line 58 &#8222;aminoimidazoaazoarenes&#8221; shouild be changed into &#8222;aminoimidazoarenes&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 3 line 63 It is not clear if antioxidants are precursors of HAAs ort hey may play a role of inhibitors of HAAs or any others contaminants</p>
<p>Page 3 line 64 &#8222; HAAs were found to be&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;HAAs content (or level) were found to be 100-fold higher&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 3 line 75 According to the Authors &#8222;some antioxidants had a prooxidant effect&#8221;, however,</p>
<p>the same antioxidants could possess prooxidant or antioxidant activity depending on their concentration in food&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 4 line 80 &#8222;natural antioxidants&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;food rich in natural antioxidants such as&#8221;, line 83 &#8222;protein, fat and carbohydrate&#8221; should be changed into &#8222;proteins, fats and harbohydrates&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 4 line 90 &#8222;carvacrola&#8221; should be changed into &#8222;carvacrol&#8221;, line 95 &#8222; antiinflamatory&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;antiinflamatory activity (or properties)&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 4 lines 96&amp;98 &#8222;thymokinone&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;thymoquinone&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 4 lines 98&amp;99 The last sentence is the exact repetition what was written before (lines 83&amp;84)</p>
<p>Page 5 line 101 &#8222;food ingredients&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;food additives&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 6 line 150 It is not clear in which way the mentioned solvents were used during the solid phase extraction methods, so a more detailed description of the SPE extraction is needed</p>
<p>Page 7 line 153 Please, give a information that the gradient method was used during chromatographic analysis, moreover, 3 mm should be changed into 3&#181;m (in case of particles diameter)</p>
<p>Page 7 line 161 Please, use the same designation in the description of Table 1 as in Table 1 (eg. &#8222;meat&#8221; in Table 1 and &#8222;beef muscle&#8221; in line 161</p>
<p>Page 8 line 199 &#8222;groups by Girard&#8221; should be changed as &#8222; groups as reported by Girard&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 13 line 314 &#8222;ranged between nd &#8211; 2,75 ng/g&#8221; should be changed into &#8222; ranged from 0,5 &#8211; 2,75 ng/g, whereas in the case of meatballs cooked at 150&#176;C HAAs were not detected&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 15 line 355 &#8222;radical quenchers and free radical scavenging activity are designation of the same phenomenon &#8211; antiradical activity</p>
<p>Page 16 line 373 &#8222;the chromatographic detector&#8221; should be changed as &#8222; type of chromatographic detection&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 16 lines 382&amp;385 The last sentence is not so adequate to the conclusion of this manuscript</p>
<p>Table 2 The Authors have given the values of determinated parameters in first line named as Usage rate (0-1) but nothin is known about temperature of cooking (in case of first line), so detailed information could be helpful for the readers (under the table or in the text),</p>
<p>With respect to the values of parameters given in line No 3 named as cooking temperature, did the Authors give the average values for various usage rate (0&#8211;1 %), please to explain</p>
