<p>Response to Reviewer 1:</p>
<p>The introduction has been expanded and a number of references added to better frame the study in the context of previous work on substance use and social network analysis. We have also reviewed previous work on using social network analysis to investigate prevention strategies and improve treatment programs. A conclusion has been added to summarize the implications of our work for prevention, harm reduction, and treatment.</p>
