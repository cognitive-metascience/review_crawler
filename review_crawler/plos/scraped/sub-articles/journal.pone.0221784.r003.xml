<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</p>
<p>Good job responding to the comments. Consistency in terminologies has made the manuscript easier to read and understand.</p>
<p>The few corrections needed are:</p>
<p>Page 6: Consider adding "disability" in the sentence with: Neurological disability by EDSS score and the functional system "disability" scores (except for visual functional score) were &#8230;..</p>
<p>Page 6, last paragraph: Table 2 shows 45/1010 while the narrative reports 45/1010 for high cognitive performance and severe disability. Which is correct?</p>
<p>Page 7, second paragraph in "Discussion": Consider changing the sentence to "The use of DMD significantly changed the pattern of MS progression."</p>
<p>Overall, check all citations and references for accuracy.</p>

<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. If the authors have adequately addressed your comments raised in a previous round of review and you feel that this manuscript is now acceptable for publication, you may indicate that here to bypass the &#8220;Comments to the Author&#8221; section, enter your conflict of interest statement in the &#8220;Confidential to Editor&#8221; section, and submit your "Accept" recommendation.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: All comments have been addressed</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the manuscript PONE-D-19-14839R1 &#8220;Cognitive function in multiple sclerosis: a long-term look on the bright side&#8221;. I was not involved in the first review round and will therefore critique the manuscript from a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>This retrospective study includes a large number (n = 1010) of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and secondary progressive MS. The main aim was to describe cognitive functioning in those patients who had received at least 10 years of disease modifying drug treatment and to correlate cognitive impairments with long term disability. The authors found that the majority of patients with MS did not have cognitive decline. The authors discuss the findings in light of cognitive resilience and long-term quality of life.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed reading the manuscript. The manuscript is topical, timely, and well-written and contributes to the body of knowledge. My major comments are:</p>
<p>1. The discussion around cognitive resilience could be strengthened. Devote at least a paragraph explaining what cognitive resilience is, how it can be captured, what predisposing factors contribute to cognitive resilience, and how that may impact disability and quality of life. Provide references.</p>
<p>2. The leap from good performance on cognitive tests to &#8220;cognitive resilience&#8221; needs better argumentation. The authors report that 33.7% are cognitive resilient because they score well on cognitive tests despite long disease duration. However, they also have mild disability. It is logical to assume that those with mild disability will also have less cognitive impairments. The 33.7% with good performance in cognitive tests reported here do well because they are generally less disabled; not necessarily because they show better cognitive resilience. You could also argue then that these individuals have better physical resilience, or respond better to disease modifying treatment. It would be more important to focus on the persons who show high cognitive performance despite moderate to severe disability, e.g., those individuals reported in Table 2.</p>
<p>I have few minor comments:</p>
<p>3. How were the three groups of cognitive performance and the three groups of neurological disability determined. Please provide references on the categorization of cognitive performance and neurological disability.</p>
<p>4. Please add in the limitations section that this study included only relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS.</p>
<p>5. Please elaborate on exclusion criterion 5. How was it determined from chart review whether a patient had severe upper limb or visual impairment?</p>
<p>6. On that note, visual performance did not differ between the three groups (Table 1), probably because visual impairment was an exclusion criterion. Please add this to the discussion.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>7. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ns0:type="simple">what does this mean?</ext-link>). If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
<p>If you choose &#8220;no&#8221;, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
<p><bold>Do you want your identity to be public for this peer review?</bold> For information about this choice, including consent withdrawal, please see our <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.plos.org/privacy-policy" ns0:type="simple">Privacy Policy</ext-link>.</p>
