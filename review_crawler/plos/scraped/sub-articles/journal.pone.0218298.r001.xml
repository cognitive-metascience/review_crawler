<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Partly</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: In this study, Nakahashi et al. established a rat model of passive cigarette smoking induced IVD degeneration, and investigated the cytohistological changes in the IVD.</p>
<p>They found that passive cigarette smoking could stimulate chondrocyte apoptosis in the end plate and reduce the extracellular matrix (ECM) of in the NP, which can then progress to IVD degeneration. This study was interesting and well written. There are few comments for this study.</p>
<p>1. After euthanasia, the spine samples were harvested and then fixed in formalin or frozen at -80&#176;C. The authors should consider doing the perfusion (first with saline to remove blood cells and followed by formalin to preserve the antigen). After perfusion, the samples would not contain the blood cells, which may affect the immunohistochemical staining. By the way, what are the samples frozen at -80&#176;C use for? Are these samples for mRNA measurement? The authors should clarify.</p>
<p>2. The authors found that type II collagen and aggrecan were decreased in the NP and CEP, while the synthesis of these two proteins were not affected by the smoking, as reflected by the mRNA repression measurement. How did the authors measure the mRNA? The authors should state the specific methods in the Methods section.</p>
<p>3. The evidence about the passive cigarette smoking-induced apoptosis in the CEP was not strong. The authors should add some other experiments, such as TUNEL staining. Also, the authors found that no significant changes in apoptosis-related gene expression were observed in the NP or AF in response to passive cigarette smoking. What about the protein expression? they should consider measuring the related protein expression via immunohistochemical staining.</p>
<p>4. In the conclusion, the authors stated passive cigarette smoking-induced stress stimuli first affect the CEP through blood flow. However, there was no results reflecting the blood flow. How did they prove that the blood flow was affected?</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>6. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ns0:type="simple">what does this mean?</ext-link>).
