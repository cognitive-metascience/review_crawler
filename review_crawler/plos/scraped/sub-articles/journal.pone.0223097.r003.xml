<p>PONE-D-19-17515R1</p>
<p>Validating a Popular Outpatient Antibiotic Database to Reliably Identify High Prescribing Physicians</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Schwartz,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE and for addressing&#160; the peer reviewer and editorial comments. However, there remain some additional issues which need to be addressed.&#160;Consequently, the manuscript&#160;does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Thank you for the title change as per the reviewer comments - please add " for patients 65 years of age and older" as well to make this point even more explicit. Also mention this point in the sentence in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>You have added the additional databases available in the Introduction as requested &#160;but the references do not &#160;reflect the actual databases - please apply more direct references and limit the your selection of&#160;self citations which are both &#160;indirect and excessive.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There are an excessive number of references&#160;cited in the Introduction about the point of both the CDC and Health&#160; Canada &#160;using the IQVIA data ie 17-39 and not all are necessary - please reduce the number by at least 50%.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The sentence containing " &#160;and the&#160;validity of IQVIA data has been assessed in some jurisdictions. [15] [16]" provides examples from within Canada and for broader populations than 65 and older and deserves to&#160;have &#160;this point added.&#160;Alternatively it could be added to&#160;the &#160;second paragraph of the Discussion when you speak about the use of this data in the US and Canada and&#160;add it as part of the academic discussion on the use of these databases. &#160;</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is a stray legend in italics on lines 204-205 just near the end of the Results - please correct this.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Despite an explicit request, the Reference section continues to have multiple errors&#160;- incorrect format not in the standard style for date ( sometimes at the front of the reference in brackets and other times elsewhere and ), non use if urls where they should be present, &#160;case errors everywhere and non use of italics for Latin terms etc. &#160;- again too numerous to count. . Please correct&#160; (do not rely on Mendeley which does not pick up all the formatting issues)&#160;or the manuscript will be returned again .</p></list-item></list></p>
