<p>[EXSCINDED]</p>
<p>Dear Dr Zhang,</p>
<p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Chromosome-wide co-fluctuation of stochastic gene expression in mammalian cells" has been editorially accepted for publication in PLOS Genetics. Congratulations!</p>
<p>There are some minor comments from Reviewer #1 about wording and references, please take that into consideration for the finalized version. Before your submission can be formally accepted and sent to production you will need to complete our formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. Please be aware that it may take several days for you to receive this email; during this time no action is required by you. Please note: the accept date on your published article will reflect the date of this provisional accept, but your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until the required changes have been made.</p>
<p>Once your paper is formally accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you&#8217;ve already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email ns0:type="simple">plosgenetics@plos.org</email>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pgenetics/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pgenetics/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production and billing process.&#160;Note that&#160;PLOS requires an ORCID iD for all corresponding authors. Therefore, please ensure that you have an ORCID iD and that it is validated in Editorial Manager. To do this, go to &#8216;Update my Information&#8217; (in the upper left-hand corner of the main menu), and click on the Fetch/Validate link next to the ORCID field.&#160; This will take you to the ORCID site and allow you to create a new iD or authenticate a pre-existing iD in Editorial Manager.</p>
<p>If you have a press-related query, or would like to know about one way to make your underlying data available (as you will be aware, this is required for publication), please see the end of this email. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming article at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. Inform journal staff as soon as possible if you are preparing a press release for your article and need a publication date.</p>
<p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Genetics!</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p><bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold></p>
<p>Reviewer #1: The authors addressed most of the points raised. In particular, they rewrote the author summary and extended Figure 2 to facilitate readability. They also inserted a brief discussion that the baseline protein noise level may vary with the genomic framework (e..g. haploid and diploid) but this does not change the conclusions. They cite a relevant paper in this context.</p>
<p>They also discuss the looping in the context of gene choice &#8220;For instance, previous research found that selective expression of genes that are clustered on the same chromosome (i.e., gene choice) is strongly dependent on intrachromosomal looping, which alters the pairwise physical distance between genes in the same gene array.&#8220; It would be more precise to state &#8220;stochastic gene choice&#8221; than merely &#8220;gene choice&#8221;. Importantly, the authors omitted to cite the relevant papers to specify the previous research:</p>
<p>Please add these references so that the meaning of these sentences becomes clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monoallelic yet combinatorial expression of variable exons of the protocadherin-alpha gene cluster in single neurons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stochastic Gene Choice during Cellular Differentiation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;CTCF/cohesin-mediated DNA looping is required for protocadherin &#945; promoter choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>These three papers provide preliminary evidence that looping drives stochastic gene choice that the expression frequency correlates with the binding of the looping factor, CTCF, to the respective genes.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The revisions have solved all my concerns. I recommend acceptance of this paper for publication.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p><bold>Have all data underlying the figures and results presented in the manuscript been provided?</bold></p>
<p>Large-scale datasets should be made available via a public repository as described in the <italic>PLOS Genetics</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/data-availability" ns0:type="simple">data availability policy</ext-link>, and numerical data that underlies graphs or summary statistics should be provided in spreadsheet form as supporting information.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ns0:type="simple">what does this mean?</ext-link>). If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
<p>If you choose &#8220;no&#8221;, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
<p><bold>Do you want your identity to be public for this peer review?</bold> For information about this choice, including consent withdrawal, please see our <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.plos.org/privacy-policy" ns0:type="simple">Privacy Policy</ext-link>.</p>

<p><bold>Data Deposition</bold></p>
<p>If you have submitted a Research Article or Front Matter that has associated data that are not suitable for deposition in a subject-specific public repository (such as GenBank or ArrayExpress), one way to make that data available is to deposit it in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.datadryad.org" ns0:type="simple">Dryad Digital Repository</ext-link>. As you may recall, we ask all authors to agree to make data available; this is one way to achieve that. A full list of recommended repositories can be found on our <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" ns0:type="simple">website</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The following link will take you to the Dryad record for your article, so you won't have to re&#8208;enter its bibliographic information, and can upload your files directly:&#160;</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://datadryad.org/submit?journalID=pgenetics&amp;manu=PGENETICS-D-19-00916R1" ns0:type="simple">http://datadryad.org/submit?journalID=pgenetics&amp;manu=PGENETICS-D-19-00916R1</ext-link></p>
<p>More information about depositing data in Dryad is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.datadryad.org/depositing" ns0:type="simple">http://www.datadryad.org/depositing</ext-link>. If you experience any difficulties in submitting your data, please contact <email ns0:type="simple">help@datadryad.org</email> for support.</p>
<p>Additionally, please be aware that our <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/data-availability" ns0:type="simple">data availability policy</ext-link> requires that all numerical data underlying display items are included with the submission, and you will need to provide this before we can formally accept your manuscript, if not already present.</p>

<p><bold>Press Queries</bold></p>
<p>If you or your institution will be preparing press materials for this manuscript, or if you need to know your paper's publication date for media purposes, please inform the journal staff as soon as possible so that your submission can be scheduled accordingly. Your manuscript will remain under a strict press embargo until the publication date and time. This means an early version of your manuscript will not be published ahead of your final version. PLOS Genetics may also choose to issue a press release for your article. If there's anything the journal should know or you'd like more information, please get in touch via <email ns0:type="simple">plosgenetics@plos.org</email>.</p>
