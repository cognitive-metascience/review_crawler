<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Dear authors,</p>
<p>I have great interest read you paper.</p>
<p>1. Introduction. Very well referred and up to standards. Given the focus and hunting competition the introduction is weak with respect to that. Please frame the competition better to enlighten the reader</p>
<p>2. Study area etc. Please add when in relation to the rut the bulls were shot. Could that - time - explain some of the unexplained variation and that older males had lower concentrations of some compounds? What if older males are active earlier during the rut, but shot at the same time or later?</p>
<p>3.Results ok</p>
<p>4. Discussion. OK, but what if older males are active earlier in the rut irrespective of level of competition?</p>
<p>All the best and good luck with your research.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Authors studied differences in the presence and concentrations of several chemical scent constituents in the dark ventral patch of Iberian red deer males. They analysed hairs of 84 males originated from two groups of populations related to the harvesting pressure which affected demographic structure of both groups and consequently also caused differences in intraspecific competition, i.e. forming high vs. low male-male sexual competition situations. In these two groups, they studied differences in chemical scent constituents in dark ventral patches of males, which are formed during the rut period and contain volatile compounds that are used in intraspecific communication.</p>
<p>The influences of the age and the dominance of red deer males (and males of some other species) have already been studies several times as is recognized also by the authors of the manuscript; however, the influence of the intensity of the intrasexual competition on the composition of the scent compounds (and hence on the intraspecific communication) has not been studied so far. By finding two different groups of red deer considering their demographic structures and former knowledge on the reproductive efforts of red deer stags in both groups authors managed to find relevant situation in situ allowing also studying of the influence of the male-male sexual competition on the extraction of volatile chemical compounds. They found significant differences in concentrations/proportions of several compounds, and managed to provide logical explanations to this variation in relation to differences in intersexual competition among stags of both groups.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that the paper is worth to be published in the PLOS ONE after the minor revision, i.e. after correction of some mistakes that are stated below:</p>
<p>Title: &#8220;Iberian male red deer&#8221; should be changed either to &#8220;Iberian red deer males&#8221; or to &#8220;male Iberian red deer&#8221;.</p>
