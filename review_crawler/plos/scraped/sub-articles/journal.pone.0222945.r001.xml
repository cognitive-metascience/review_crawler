<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: I have read carefully the paper entitled as &#8220;Analyzing a networked social algorithm for collective selection of representative committees&#8220; by Hern&#225;ndez et al., submitted to PLoS ONE for publication. The paper builds on an earlier work published by the same set of authors recently [1], which proposes an algorithm to construct representative committees using personal and collective preferences in networked populations. In this paper they extend their earlier findings by considering committee&#8217;s trustability.</p>
<p>I have some comments what I suggest to the authors to consider:</p>
<p>- Figure 1 has been already published in [1] and this fact is not acknowledged in the actual manuscript.</p>
<p>- It is not clear what is novel algorithmically and in terms of results as compared to the pervious paper of the authors [1]. Please highlight.</p>
<p>- Their method assumes global network knowledge about the underlying social network what is commonly unknown. The authors (implicitly) argue that this is not a problem as their method is meant for online social networks where social ties are mapped with high precision. However, it is usually not the case as (a) detailed online social network data is not available but only for the provider, (b) it may contain several non-real social ties and non-human actors (e.g. bots), and (c) it may not capture all social ties (e.g. offline relationships) which at the same time might be important for opinion formation. I would suggest to the authors to address these questions and show how the outcome of their process is changing by assuming incomplete knowledge about the network structure.</p>
<p>- In page 4 the authors explain that a representative committee can be selected in two steps: first identifying cycles in the representative graphs and then by thresholding to select people by the number of votes they gained in their downstream tree structure.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it is a possible scenario that a group of people agree in advance to bias the first step of this process to vote such that they form a cycle. This way they would increase the probability that some of them will be selected from the cycle in the committee. The authors address resilience issues in the end of the manuscript (starting from line 218) but miss to address the problem when fraud is not individual but organised between a larger group of people.</p>
<p>- In the paragraph starting from line 119 the authors discuss that they tested their algorithm on three conventional network models while they were concentrating on the dependencies of the selection outcome on generic network properties like degree heterogeneity, average connectivity, or shortest paths. One important characteristic missed here is community structure, which can largely influence the outcome of the committee selection algorithm. I would suggest to the authors to use one of the many (Planted L-partition model, NG benchmark, LFR benchmark) community network model to test the effect of intra/inter community link density on the outcomes.</p>
<p>- For validation purposes it would be necessary that the authors explore their model via data-driven simulations where they take a real social network as an underlying structure and model the committee selection process on the top. Simulating the process only on synthetic overly simplified network models is important for exploration but may provide results far from reality.</p>
