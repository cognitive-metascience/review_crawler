<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: N/A</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This reviewer enjoyed very much in reading this excellent manuscript. This work combines the fields of the vector-borne diseases, antimicrobial resistance and microbiology. The manuscript is well written, and the conclusion is well supported by the data. Main comments:</p>
<p>1) I strongly feel like that the portion of commensal fungi can be left out for another independent publication. Please focus on the beauty of this work, antimicrobial resistance and mosquitoes. Do not get distracted by the addition of fungi, in which you did not get any isolates, and cannot characterize the nature of their antimicrobial resistance;</p>
<p>2) For the field-caught mosquitoes, did you try to wash the mosquitoes before performing bacterial isolation etc? There are constant contact between mosquitoes and animal hosts/environmental surfaces etc. The identified microbiome could be on the surface of the mosquitoes, or their inside? Please provide more information, and make meaningful discussion;</p>
<p>3) As indicated in Fig 2 (Schematic diagram of bacterial culturing), you used LB initially, followed by the utilization of different selective media. Please justify this approach. What would you get if you would use the selective media directly without the use of LB media? Even LB is not a type of selective media, the process of LB culture may still provide some preference of certain bacteria which overgrow over others;</p>
<p>4) It is great that the authors used the bioinformatics to identify bacterial OUTs in this work. In the meantime, it would be more clinically more important and meaningful if you could identify the genus level and even species level of the isolated bacterial from the antibiotics-resistant plates. You are very close to provide this valuable information since these isolates are available to you, and you can even ID them by the use of the whole-length 16S rRNA sequencing.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Well done paper.</p>
<p>On line 95 I think you are missing the word resistant - it states antibiotic populations and I think you meant to say antibiotic resistant populations. That is the only change that I have.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>6. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ns0:type="simple">what does this mean?</ext-link>). If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
<p>If you choose &#8220;no&#8221;, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
<p><bold>Do you want your identity to be public for this peer review?</bold> For information about this choice, including consent withdrawal, please see our <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.plos.org/privacy-policy" ns0:type="simple">Privacy Policy</ext-link>.</p>
