<p>Dear Dr. Canals,</p>
<p>We are pleased to inform that your manuscript, "The fitness landscape of the African Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 strain D23580 reveals unique properties of the pBT1 plasmid", has been editorially accepted for publication at PLOS Pathogens.&#160;</p>
<p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted and sent to production, you will need to complete our formatting changes, which you will receive by email within a week. Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTES</p>
<p>(1) Please note, once your paper is accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you&#8217;ve already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email ns0:type="simple">plospathogens@plos.org</email>.</p>
<p>(2) Copyediting and Proofreading: The corresponding author will receive a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.&#160;</p>
<p>(3) Appropriate Figure Files: Please remove all name and figure # text from your figure files. Please also take this time to check that your figures are of high resolution, which will improve the readbility of your figures and help expedite your manuscript's publication. Please note that figures must have been originally created at 300dpi or higher. Do not manually increase the resolution of your files. For instructions on how to properly obtain high quality images, please review our Figure Guidelines, with examples at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/figures" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/figures</ext-link>.</p>
<p>While revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the Preflight Analysis and Conversion Engine (PACE) digital diagnostic tool, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com" ns0:type="simple">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com</ext-link>.&#160;PACE helps ensure that figures meet PLOS requirements. To use PACE, you must first register as a user. Then, login and navigate to the UPLOAD tab, where you will find detailed instructions on how to use the tool. If you encounter any issues or have any questions when using PACE, please email us at <email ns0:type="simple">figures@plos.org</email>.</p>
<p>(4) Striking Image: Please upload a striking still image to accompany your article if one is available (you can include a new image or an existing one from within your manuscript). Should your paper be accepted, this image will be considered for our monthly issue image and may also appear on our website to feature your article. Please upload this as a separate file, selecting "striking image" as the file type upon upload. Please also include a separate "Other" file with a caption, including credits and any potential copyright information. Please do not include the caption in the main article file. If your image is from someone other than yourself, please ensure that the artist has read and agreed to the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution License at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/content-license" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/content-license</ext-link>. Please note that PLOS cannot publish copyrighted images.</p>
<p>(5) Press Release or Related Media: If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximize its impact. If they will be preparing press materials for this manuscript, please inform our press team in advance at <email ns0:type="simple">plospathogens@plos.org</email> as soon as possible. We ask that you contact us within one week to plan ahead of our fast Production schedule. If you need to know your paper's publication date for related media purposes, you must coordinate with our press team, and your manuscript will remain under a strict press embargo until the publication date and time. This means an early version of your manuscript will not be published ahead of your final version.&#160;</p>
<p>(6)&#160;&#160;PLOS requires an ORCID iD for all corresponding authors on papers submitted after December 6th, 2016. Please ensure that you have an ORCID iD and that it is validated in Editorial Manager. &#160;To do this, go to &#8216;Update my Information&#8217; (in the upper left-hand corner of the main menu), and click on the Fetch/Validate link next to the ORCID field. &#160;This will take you to the ORCID site and allow you to create a new iD or authenticate a pre-existing iD in Editorial Manager</p>
<p>(7) Update your Profile Information: Now that your manuscript has been provisionally accepted, please log into Editorial Manager and update your profile, if needed. Go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/ppathogens" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/ppathogens</ext-link>, log in, and click on the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page. Please update your user information to ensure an efficient production and billing process.&#160;</p>
<p>(8) LaTeX users only: Our staff will ask you to upload a TEX file in addition to the PDF before the paper can be sent to typesetting, so please carefully review our Latex Guidelines <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/latex" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/latex</ext-link> in the meantime.</p>
<p>(9)&#160;If you have associated protocols in protocols.io, please ensure that you make them public before publication to guarantee immediate access to the methodological details.</p>
<p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Pathogens.&#160;</p>
