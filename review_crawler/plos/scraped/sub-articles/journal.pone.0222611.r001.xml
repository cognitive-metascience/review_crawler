<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: In general this is a well-written and clear paper with interesting and meaningful results. In particular the authors do an excellent job of describing their methods and results in a way that will be understood by a broad audience. Any suggestions for edits are only relevant if this paper is not meant to be published as a brief report.</p>
<p>If this paper is not a brief report, then the introduction needs to be expanded to further explore how existing literature frames the current study. This should include literature that is specific to substance use in networks, homelessness/housing, and the assortativity characteristics you assess. If the introduction is expanded, it would also be helpful to articulate a set of research questions that clearly lead to your analytic plan.</p>
<p>Methods are extensive, appropriate for the study, and clearly described. The authors do a nice job outlining rigorous methods in a way that will be understandable to a broad audience.</p>
<p>The discussion is concise, but provides a nice, comprehensible overview of findings and implications. If the paper is expanded, I would like to see more specific recommendations for intervention, housing, and/or practice from the perspective of the authors.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This paper provides a valuable exploration into how the structure of networks and peer relationships impact the substance using behavior of precariously housed individuals recruited single room occupancy hotels in Vancouver. Overall the paper is quite excellent. The methods are well described and the social network analysis is appropriate to the questions raised by the authors.</p>
<p>My only minor criticism is with the discussion section. The authors make a point in both the abstract and the introduction of framing the importance of this work around the potential to inform interventions. Yet, the discussion of intervention direction is very superficial. Essentially, they say in one sentence on p. 20 line 370-371 &#8220;Concurrent use of substances creates complex phamacologies that may be of interest as clues to developing substitution therapies, or novel treatments.&#8221; This is really insufficient given the frame of the paper. I would recommend several citations below by Rice and his colleagues which explore similar network issues among homeless youth and provide more rigorous direction for interventions.</p>
