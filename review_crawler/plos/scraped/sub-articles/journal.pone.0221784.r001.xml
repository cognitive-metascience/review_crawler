<p>Additional Editor Comments:</p>
<p>The manuscript reports on the cognitive performance in individuals with long history of MS treated with DMD in relation to disability and cognitive resilience.</p>
<p>Overall, there needs to be consistencies in terminologies throughout the manuscript. Low cognitive, moderate cognitive, and high cognitive performance or severe cognitive, moderate cognitive, and low cognitive impairments. Specifically, define cognitive resilience in light of the terminology you choose. These will facilitate better comprehension of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Abstract: Apart from the inconsistency in terminologies, this section is well-written.</p>
<p>Introduction: Short and succinct.</p>
<p>Methods: Reads well.</p>
<p>Results: Page 6, end of the first paragraph: As shown in Table 1, there was also no significant difference in visual functions. This fact needs to be included in the narrative as well.</p>
<p>Figure 1 is exactly the same information as in Table 2. Either one, plus the narrative should be sufficient.</p>
<p>Discussion: Page 7, end of the first paragraph: Can you discuss some of side effects of DMDs?</p>
<p>Page 9: beginning of the second paragraph: If this is a prospective study, how is it possible that data was collected prospectively?</p>
