<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: The authors have tried to address the role of infection on induction of metabolic program in THP-1 cells. Addressed that metabolic changes for these cells does not affect its viability and Warburg effect does not play a role. Interestingly, very few cytokines were expressed upon infection in these cells. I would like the authors to address the following concerns.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>1. I assume fig. 1a is the western blot for TLR protein. It does not seem upon induction with LPS 5ng/ml the protein does not increased while mRNA increased. How many repeats were carried out for western blot and if possible quantify after three repeats, if done.</p>
<p>2. No mention of western blot protocol in material method section. Authors has to be careful in this regard and update it.</p>
<p>3. Fig. 3a- I am not sure how many repeats were carried out for ELISA.</p>
<p>4. Fig. 3b-e &#8211; Again for western blots- I would like to see how many repeats were carried out and if possible can they quantify the western blots that can be comparable with the RT-PCR result.</p>
<p>5. This is because it is confusing for all the Figures in 3, as an example &#8211; the difference between mRNA to protein in Fig. 3b- compared to 5ng/ml+PmB to 10ng/ml LPS the mRNA level is same between these samples while the 10ng/ml LPS the protein level is high.</p>
<p>6. Similarly, for RANTES (Fig. 3C)- as by visualization 10ng/ml LPS has protein while 10ng/ml LPS with PmB no protein while the mRNA profile is different between these samples.</p>
<p>7. Thus, it is important to address this issue upon repeating western for all these genes (Fig. 3c to e) and quantify whether there is any mRNA and protein difference.</p>
<p>8. Since the authors have addressed the impact of cytokines and its linkage with downstream pathways. Why not address few genes that are linked to IL8 or RANTES by knocking down these genes to show its effect on its interactome?</p>
<p>9. I would also like to know NF kappa B expression upon these treats because it will be an important marker to show that even though NF kappa B expression increased in LPS treatment, only few of its target cytokines expression is altered.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this manuscript, the authors analyzed cytokine production and Warburg effect induced by LPS in THP-1 AML cell line. While it is already widely known that LPS induces inflammatory cytokine production, the authors report an interesting finding in the glycolytic changes in THP-1 cells. The techniques used by the authors are sound, and the results fully demonstrate their conclusion.</p>
