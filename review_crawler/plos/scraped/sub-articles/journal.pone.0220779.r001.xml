<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Partly</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: This work prepared selenium nanoparticles and investigated their antidiabetic action and synergy with metformin. The study is sufficient and sound in experiments and results. It provides insight into the use of selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) to combat type 2 DM. However, some minor revisions are required to be addressed for improving the manuscript. Here, I raised some recommendations to the authors for reference.</p>
<p>1. The title of this article needs to be amended. Type 2 diabetes-induced rats is a wrong expression. HFD/STZ-induced type 2 diabetes rats or type 2 diabetic model rats are more suitable.</p>
<p>2. The functions of selenium as antidiabetic agent should be elaborated in the introduction section. The authors can refer to the latest publication (Guan, B. et al. Selenium as a pleiotropic agent for medical discovery and drug delivery. Int. J. Nanomedicine. 2018, 13: 7473-7490) for citation.</p>
<p>3. In the introduction section, some representative examples using selenium nanoparticles for treatment of diabetes should be contained to highlight the antidiabetic advantages of Se-NPs, for example, Deng, W. et al. Selenium nanoparticles as versatile carriers for oral delivery of insulin: Insight into the synergic antidiabetic effect and mechanism. Nanomedicine. 2017, 13: 1965-1974. Deng, W. et al. Selenium-layered nanoparticles serving for oral delivery of phytomedicines with hypoglycemic activity to synergistically potentiate the antidiabetic effect. Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B. 2019, 9: 74-86.</p>
<p>4. Regarding the preparation of Se-NPs, why does the coating with dextrin happen after Se-NPs preparation. As a stabilizing agent, polymer is normally concurrently added into the system upon reaction of ionic selenium and reductant.</p>
<p>5. Why is the insulin concentration in HFD/STZ model far higher than the control? Does HFD/STZ induction result in more secretion of insulin? This is abnormal that the insulin level does not reduce but inversely increase in diabetic rats in logicality.</p>
<p>6. The toxicity of Se-NPs is a great concern for its biomedical application. The authors should investigate the cytotoxicity of Se-NPs using cell test or other techniques.</p>
<p>7. The English language of this manuscript should be enhanced. Some expressions are confused in style.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: - There are many English errors. The work should be revised by an English native speaker.</p>
<p>- The authors can't use "dose-dependent" with two investigated doses only, at list the word used with three doses.</p>
<p>- "HFD was administered" should be "HFD was supplemented".</p>
<p>- "different diabetic complication pathways" vague expression. In this study, the authors focused mainly on the anti-diabetic effect of Se.</p>
<p>- "After 16 weeks of daily oral administration" should be 8 instead of 16.</p>
<p>- Histopathology of liver and pancrease are highly recommended.</p>
<p>- Figure's 2 legend needs more explanation.</p>
<p>- How many assays were performed to obtained the results those used to illustrate fig.3?</p>
<p>- Final BW (&#181;g) ???</p>
<p>**********</p>
