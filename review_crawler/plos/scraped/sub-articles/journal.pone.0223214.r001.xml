(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: 1. While I wouldn't ask for repeat of these experiments, given the challenges of working with coral larvae, I'm a little concerned with the conclusions regarding vertical transmission of bacteria from the parental colony. While a previous publication of a co-author does show the inhibitory effects of settlement from the addition of antibiotics, given the annual variation in larvae, there's insufficient evidence to preclude the effects of settlement and metamorphosis resulting from vertically transmitted microbes.</p>
<p>2. While I believe the Mann-whitney test is appropriate for these data, please provide cutoffs in text and in the figures. There's often mention of significance, but statistical values are missing. And although there does appear to be some trends, values are necessary.</p>
<p>3. Please provide values for the statistics on figures, in text, and figure descriptions.</p>
<p>4. Grammatical suggestions, as well as specific points addressed above are provided by line.</p>
<p>Line 45: remove "a" before substantial</p>
<p>Line 46: There are several sentences within the first paragraph (including this line) that are rather long (run-on). Perhaps the paper will read better by separating the sentence? Another instance is Line 58/59.</p>
<p>Line 177: Perhaps it's beneficial to the reader to write out what BCCM/LMG stands for?</p>
<p>Line 184: Please clarify what is being exchange here. I understood it to be bacterial containing seawater, but are filtered fractions from the same batch used for all exchanges over the study period and stored? Or is it a new batch of water from the same source, which is filtered prior to the exchange?</p>
<p>Line 192: insert "of" between "comprised" and "coccoid"</p>
<p>Line 202: missing "the" before "data"</p>
<p>Line 208: remaining --&gt; remainder</p>
<p>Line 225: Please indicate the statistical cut-off of significance. Figure S1 also lacks information regarding the cut-off. Also, what exactly is this line referring to? It seems all larvae died by day 12, regardless of the light condition, although those in light:dark cycle at a greater rate.</p>
<p>Line 230: Please provide the statistics. Were there any statistically significant differences in survival rates for data presented in Figure 2?</p>
<p>Line 238: Why is the advanced stage for Figure 3 not categorized as short and long tentacles? Please provide this data. Additionally, please provide statistics for figure 3.</p>
<p>Line 241: rate --&gt; rates</p>
<p>Line 241: could be --&gt; were</p>
<p>Line 241: It'd be great to have some values provided for this statement regarding survival, as in, what percentage did survive under stagnant conditions?</p>
<p>Line 264: This paragraph refers to light:dark but it's unclear until I read line 314 that light:dark in this section is referring to un-autoclaved SW. Please make this more clear.</p>
<p>Line 273: Is this line referring to figure 5?</p>
<p>Line 285/286: I don't see this is figure 4. Perhaps I should read it as "by" day 35? On day 35 for 2.7 uM-dark, metamorphosis is below 70%.</p>
<p>Line 293: Please provide statistics.</p>
<p>Line 330: Are there any statistics for this?</p>
<p>Given the complexity of the microbiome of the seawater, perhaps some of the observed effects of the fractions were due to competitive interactions between microbes within the seawater resulting in exclusion of pathogens. Therefore, while no "beneficial" bacteria directly interacted with the larvae, pathogenic/harmful bacteria were also prevented from affecting the larvae.</p>
<p>Line 348: insert "of" before 80-90%</p>
<p>Line 349: Is this line referring to Figure S4?</p>
<p>Line 352: remove "the" before "larval ..."</p>
<p>Line 353: I believe this is referring to Figure S5?</p>
<p>Line 356: insert space after "...P14)"</p>
<p>Line 359: Please provide method in more detail, preferably in methods section.</p>
<p>- What does this mean?</p>
<p>Line 361: Planule --&gt; planulae</p>
<p>Line 349 - 351: Is this reduction in metamorphosis significant? Also, it seems that although more larvae do achieve the early metamorphosis stage in unchanged water, those under exchanged water conditions achieved advance metamorphosis. Can it really be considered retardation if some larvae are capable of reversion? Also, is the statement in line 352 contradictory to that in line 349-351?</p>
<p>Line 365: Insert "uM" after 0.22</p>
<p>Line 396: I think either "unraveling" or "revealing" was meant to be used here, rather than "unrevealing"</p>
<p>Line 407: As mentioned in the beginning, there's no evidence on what bacteria are vertically transmitted or horizontally acquired. I don't think it's appropriate to discuss acquisition, but rather potential interactions</p>
<p>Line 449: It would have been nice to have a negative control in which larvae were maintained with antibiotics.</p>
<p>Line 450: It's oogenesis and not embryogenesis?</p>
<p>Line 501: There seems to be some information missing after "addition of ..."</p>
<p>The authors investigated seawater filtered through various pore sizes on larval survival and settlement/metamorphosis in order to determine if microbes can have a beneficial role. The authors found survival rates and settlement/metamorphosis of larvae to be partially increased in some instances by the presence of microbes. It's somewhat unclear whether the claims made in the discussion regarding the benefits of particular bacterial species are real. However, there are interesting findings that could certainly provide avenues for further exploration.</p>
<p>Additional questions I had were whether the metamorphic stage of the polyp is a good indication of timing of initiation. Does development to the long tentacle stage occur at the same rate, or can some polyps remain at a short tentacle stage for longer periods?</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this manuscript, Freire et al. investigate the effect of bacteria on larval settlement and metamorphosis of the soft coral species Rhytisma fulvum fulvum sampled from the Red Sea. Using an in vitro cultivation system, they assess survival, settlement and metamorphosis performances of wild caught planulae, comparing different types of filtered, autoclaved and bacteria-enriched seawater. This study provides interesting data on octocoral larval settlement, for which little is known. I would suggest few changes in the representation and interpretation of data before publishing the manuscript.</p>
<p>1) In the Material and Method section, the Authors write: &#8220;Since data did not fulfill the conditions of normality and homoscedasticity, and could not be improved by transformation, they were analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test&#8221; (line 202). In all graphs, however, spread of data is represented using the mean and standard deviation, generally a bad representation for non-normally distributed data, since they can be strongly affected by extreme values. A more appropriate alternative would be to use median and interquartile range as a measure of dispersion. If mean and standard deviation are to be kept, it should be demonstrated why they provide a good representation of the analyzed data.</p>
<p>2) One of the main conclusions of this study is that vertically inherited bacteria (acquired during the brooding period) are sufficient to induce settlement. This is based on the observation that wild-caught planulae put into sterile (autoclaved) water can still settle and metamorphose, while previous reports showed that planulae put in seawater containing antibiotics do not (Ben-David-Zaslow and Benayahu 1998). From this, the Authors conclude that &#8220;vertical transfer of the bacteria to the larvae during oogenesis is sufficient to support larval settlement and development in R. f. fulvum&#8221; (line 450). While the Authors are likely correct in their conclusions, experimental data proving this claim are still missing, and it is still possible that environmental bacteria acquired during the course of the experiments were involved in larval settlement. A key control would be to place the planulae first in autoclaved-seawater containing antibiotics and then to replace the medium with autoclaved-seawater, expecting that those planulae would never settle and metamorphose, contrary to those that have not been treated with antibiotics. Considering the difficulty in obtaining new biological material of this species I would not suggest the Authors to perform new experiments. Instead, I would suggest the Authors to be more cautious in the Abstract and Discussion.</p>
<p>3) The Authors make the interesting observation that planulae maintained in constant darkness have initially a higher chance to settle but then lower chance to complete metamorphosis, compared to planulae under a day-night cycle. They conclude that &#8220;Light is beneficial for planulae development after day 20 [&#8230;] indicating the possible presence of beneficial phototrophic bacteria in the coral microbiome&#8221; (line 36). However the Authors do not provide any proof for the presence of those phototrophic bacteria and their role in this process. I think the Authors should be more cautious and discuss alternative scenarios &#8211; in particular the possibility that the metamorphosing planulae themselves positively respond to light. Many types of photosensitive cells have indeed been described in cnidarians, including at the planula stage in some species.</p>
<p>4) A few typos can be found throughout the text. Few examples (please correct):</p>
<p>Line 27 &#8220;in the absence nature reef substrata&#8221;</p>
<p>Line 129 &#8220;the resultis indicate&#8221;</p>
<p>Line 135 &#8220;(Forsk&#229;l 1975)&#8221;</p>
<p>I would also suggest changing the title to: &#8220;The effect of bacteria on larval settlement and metamorphosis in the octocoral Rhytisma fulvum fulvum&#8221;.</p>
