<p>Organic resolution function and effects of non-colloidal platinum nanoparticles on bacteria and organic matter</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Professor Kazuhiro,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands.

<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: No</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: The submitted paper entitled" Organic resolution function and effects of non colloidal platinum nanoparticles on bacteria and organic matter" shows the antibacterial effects,its potential to decompose LPS and its use in peridontal applications. The manuscript is well written and deserves a publication with some minor revisions. Below is the some comments and suggestions to improve the quality of manuscript.</p>
<p>Technical comments</p>
<p>1. In material method section (Bacterial culture and regulation),write down the parameters for shaking at what rpm shaking was kept for aerobic bacteria</p>
<p>2. Add a section of stock solution preparation of NPs under material method</p>
<p>3. In material and method section "antibacterial testing" add a reference for the protocol utilized</p>
<p>4. In the discussion section, line no. 243,explain the mechanism of interaction of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with NPs</p>
<p>5. In the discussion section, line no. 268, when LPS reacts with NPs is there any charge based interaction in Gram negative bacteria</p>
<p>6. Figure number 3 add an X axis demarcation</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Authors reported non-colloidal platinum nanoparticles functional potential for decomposing organic matter. As the author pointed out, the NC-PtNPs increase fragmentation and decomposition of albumin, which may limit their practical applications because besides damging the LPs, the proposed NPs can be toxic to host through damaging the albumin. However, I found several serious problems in this manuscript and cannot accept this manuscript in a present form.</p>
<p>1. The authors claim non-colloidal form, but the particle size is 2&#8211;19 nm and suspended in water. Comment on it.</p>
<p>2. Although the NPs are obtained from commercial source, its size should be verified after suspended in water and data should be presented.</p>
<p>3. What will happen to fate of the NPs size and morphology after contacting either albumin or LPS.</p>
<p>4. What is mechanism of decomposition?</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>6. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ns0:type="simple">what does this mean?</ext-link>). If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
<p>If you choose &#8220;no&#8221;, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
<p><bold>Do you want your identity to be public for this peer review?</bold> For information about this choice, including consent withdrawal, please see our <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.plos.org/privacy-policy" ns0:type="simple">Privacy Policy</ext-link>.</p>
