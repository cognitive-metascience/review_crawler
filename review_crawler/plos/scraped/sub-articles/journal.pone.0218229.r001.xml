<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Yotsumoto et al provide toxicity data for a novel C-type natriuretic analog that may have utility in treating achondroplasia. Pathological changes observed included necrosis within the metaphysis, fibrosis in the marrow head, and ectopic chondrogenesis/osteogenesis. These pathological events were confined to animals with active growth plates and potentially the result of excessive growth velocity. This is a generally well-written paper that provides new and useful information.</p>
<p>Specific Comments.</p>
<p>1/ Introduction, line 44:- replace &#8220;expecting&#8221; with &#8220;exciting&#8221; This line should read &#8220;&#8230;(CNP) analog is one of the most exciting therapeutic &#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>2/ The reviewer suggest more background information regarding the rational for using a CNP/ghrelin chimeric peptide should be provided eg describe the potential for interaction with hyaluronic acid.</p>
<p>3/ Page 12, line 191:- There is no mention in the results section of any differences in blood chemistry measurements observed between the groups eg triglycerides (mentioned in the methods section). If there were no significant differences, the reviewer suggests line 191 could read &#8220;&#8230; ophthalmology, blood chemistry, urinalysis &#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>4/ It would be helpful for the reader if the age of the rats was included in the title of Supporting Table 1 or alternatively the title to the table read &#8220;Study 1 &#8211; histopathology in rats treated subcutaneously with &#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript titled &#8220;Safety assessment of a novel C-type natriuretic peptide derivative and the mechanism of bone and mineral specific toxicity&#8221; by Yotsumoto et al describes experiments injecting a new GC-B activator in 12-month old rats and examining effects in bone and cartilage tissue. These data are of potential interest to the field because they suggest that the dosing regimen of the CNP analog may be important for successful clinical results.</p>
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>Figure 4 of this manuscript shows a very interesting inverse relationship in response to ASB20123 infusion with the drug increasing bone length and decreasing density in both the cortical and trabecular bone. If this is the case, then it may limit the use of the drug because while it increases long bone length, it also results in less bone mineral density, which is unfavorable.</p>
<p>It would be very interesting to see if the BMD increases with time after the initial CNP analog infusion period has ended. In other words, if ASB20123 increases bone length, does it always also decrease bone mineral density or does it return to normal values after the ASB20123 treatment is discontinued. To test this, the investigators should analyze another group of animals 6 weeks after the last ASB20123 injection and determine if BMR is still reduced or whether it increased in the absence of the drug. The question being addressed with this experiment is whether any increase in bone length resulting from ASB20123 infusion also results in permanent reductions in BMD? If the later scenario is observed, then this could limit the utility of ASB20123 in the treatment of achondroplasia if it always results in less dense, and presumably, weaker bone.</p>
<p>Minor issues:</p>
<p>The manuscript would benefit by editing from a native English-speaking person. Trabecular bone is the newer and more common term for &#8220;spongy&#8221; bone.</p>
