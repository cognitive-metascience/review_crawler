<p>1) line 300: minimum inhibitory concentration of the biofilm was determined in C diff bioflm model or mocrobiota-Cdiff biofim model?</p>
<p>Response: The minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined from C. difficile biofilm without microbiota. The point was clarified in the new manuscript in line 301.</p>
<p>2) It would be more informative to check transcription of toxins, germination of spores, and adhesion and biofilm formation capability.</p>
<p>Response: Regarding the adhesion and biofilm formation, we calculated the adherence capability as adherence index for each isolate producing biofilm, and there was no difference between R-CDI and NR-CDI. This information is included in the manuscript. </p>
<p>We added transcription of toxins as perspectives of the study (line 336). However, we expect a low impact because toxin transcription has shown to be ribotype-dependent and our population was mostly infected with 027 ribotype in either R-CDI or NR-CDI isolates.</p>
<p>We also added germination of spores as perspective (line 330) because our data support the role of sporulation pathway genes (sigH, spo0A), in the development of recurrent CDI.</p>
