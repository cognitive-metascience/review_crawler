<p>Reviewer #1: Line 102- Women with cervical lesions not amenable to cryotherapy or</p>
<p>103 suspicious for cancer were referred to a gynecologist. What was the distance women had to travel to see a gynecologist and what was the waiting time?</p>
<p>Line 112- The study population for the main trial were women in Migori County who were eligible</p>
<p>113 for cervical cancer screening based on the Kenya Ministry of Health&#8217;s guidelines: 25-65 years old with an intact uterus and cervix. &#8211; add reference</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>&#8220;Patient factors affecting successful linkage to treatment in a cervical cancer prevention program in Kenya: a prospective cohort study&#8221;</p>
<p>General comment</p>
<p>&#8226; The manuscript is well written however there are some comments in each of the section that could improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>&#8226; In the results section provide direction of association for the significant variables whether positive or negative</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>More background need to be provided on the linkage rate after screening in the region and in the whole country in general. This is not clear before assessing factors what is the burden.</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>Were the participants counseled prior or after testing?</p>
<p>In the methods it is stated that this current manuscript focuses on the group that was exposed to enhanced linkage strategy that included transport facilitation for a limited number of participants. How many among the one studied had facilitated transportation? How was this handled in the analysis.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>&#8226; The variable Missed work to come to the CHC for screening was this for women who were employed or for all women</p>
<p>&#8226; How were the variables &#8220;Told by partner, family member, or someone else important to come to the CHC&#8221; and &#8220;Told by partner, family member, or someone else important not to come to the CHC&#8221; phrased since one is the negative of the other.</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Women with a college education or beyond were not significantly more likely to present for treatment than women in the least educated category (OR 2.17, 95% CI 0.65-7.26), with a wide confidence interval in the setting of very few women having a college education or more&#8221;. Why not consider collapsing the groups?</p>
<p>&#8226; Was multicollinearity before the adjusted odds ratio were obtained.</p>
<p>Data Availability</p>
<p>Indicated that the data is available but no link to the data</p>
