<p>Journal Requirements:</p>
<p>1. When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>2. We note that you have included the phrase &#8220;data not shown&#8221; in your manuscript. Unfortunately, this does not meet our data sharing requirements. PLOS does not permit references to inaccessible data. We require that authors provide all relevant data within the paper, Supporting Information files, or in an acceptable, public repository. Please add a citation to support this phrase or upload the data that corresponds with these findings to a stable repository (such as Figshare or Dryad) and provide and URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers that may be used to access these data. Or, if the data are not a core part of the research being presented in your study, we ask that you remove the phrase that refers to these data.</p>

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: N/A</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: N/A</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This publication combines the discovery of two new viral species candidates and the addition of nearly whole genome from known viruses. The study includes high throughput sequencing analysis with downstream efforts to characterize the newly identified viruses through greenhouse assays and field survey. This work is fully acceptable for publication in the journal and some modifications could be added to the document.</p>
<p>The discussion might be too long as it often repeats the observed results. The discussion could therefore be shortened underlining key elements of discussion (for example NCR discussion, the explanation on failure to reproduce symptoms&#8230;).</p>
<p>The consensus sequences have a reference number in Genebank but the raw data have not been made publicly available on dedicated repository (unless I missed it). It is preferable to have them available for the scientific community.</p>
<p>Line 59 : for the known Allium carla- and potyviruses : are they transmitted by the same species of aphids and which ones ?</p>
<p>Line 59: is it the viruses or the aphids that are frequently found on cultivated Allium species ?</p>
<p>Line 79:which proportion/number of plants were negative for OYDV and LYSV: it was all the plants or a majority ? This orientated the selection of samples for sequencing ?</p>
<p>Line 93: were the samples from the same location/field; neighboring plants ?</p>
<p>Line 150: the host range test corresponds to the ability to infect indicator plants using mechanical inoculation and not closely related plant species by aphid transmission mode. I would change the title accordingly. Host range test would rather be transmission by aphids on different Allium species</p>
<p>Line 165 : Koch&#8217;s postulate. Could you describe with more details the inoculation protocol for the 21 virus-free shallots. Was it mechanical or by aphids ?</p>
<p>Line 175: the positive control is on shallot or onion or both ?</p>
<p>Line 177-179: the planting was done in field or in insect-proof greenhouse ?</p>
<p>Line 305: a first view on the diversity of the virus is indeed obtained but more details on the geographical localisation of isolates could be informative</p>
<p>Line 353: the genomes have been sequenced from symptomatic and/or asymptomatic samples ? There is the information in Table 1 but this could be underlined here.</p>
<p>Line 377: same question as before: symptomatic or asymptomatic samples ?</p>
<p>For the analysis of shallot virus X, shallot latent virus and SMYSaV (Fig S2 for the latter), is there any geographical explanation in the clustering of isolates for whole genome or for CP only ? The tw clusters of SMYSaV are they geographically different ?</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The MS titled &#8220;Characterization of the virome of shallots affected by the shallot mild yellow stripe disease in France&#8221; describes the effort to determine the disease agent of a new disease of shallots. The authors identify the viruses in diseased sampled using a HTS approach, then verify the genomes with completion of the UTRs using RACE. They also screen samples collected over a time period (symptomatic and asymptomatic) for these and other known shallot viruses. They also attempt to fulfil the Koch&#8217;s postulate for the some of the new viruses identified in this study.</p>
<p>In general, I do not see any issues with the MS. It is clear and well written. There are section that one can reduce by making some summarized in tables (% identities etc). I only have minor edits for the authors and these I have made on the attached pdf.</p>
