<p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This is a very interesting paper showing how preserving metabolic function through microbiota modulation AD risk can be reduced.</p>
<p>In my opinion the author should mention recent papers demonstrating that upon probiotics administration AD progression is counteracted based on microbiota modulation, reduction of inflammatory cytokinesm increased SCFAs, increased neuroprotective gut hormones (Bonfili L. et al. Scientific Reports 2017)</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: 1 The expression of APOE4 should be included after the adminstration of inulin. And more AD biomaker as Tau, BACE, p-Tau, or histopathology of brain and colon.</p>
<p>2 I think there are at lest two does of inulin treated groups should be proved.</p>
<p>3 What the dose judgment, 8% of inulin? AS: Vishal Singh et al., (2018), Dysregulated Microbial Fermentation of Soluble Fiber Induces Cholestatic Liver Cancer, Cell, DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.004" ns0:type="simple">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.004</ext-link>.</p>
<p>4 More the correction analysis bteween the AD biomaker and gut microbiota, Metabolite.</p>
<p>5 Are the metabolite of Scyllo-inositol and myo-inositol is related to AD?</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: In their manuscript, the Authors have investigated the neuroprotective role of inulin ingestion by in vivo tests on E4FAD mice. The Authors have demonstrated that inulin has beneficial effects on microbiota and neuroinflammation. In fact, the experiments were performed to demonstrate that inulin compound have an anti-neurodegenerative role in mice fed with inulin diet. The topic is really interesting and the experiments are well designed. For this reason, I suggest only some corrections.</p>
<p>1. The references Nuzzo D, et al. Nutrients 2018 and Amato A et al. Nutrients 2017 should be added in the introduction to describe the link between oxidative stress and diseases.</p>
<p>2. I suggest to give more information regarding the mouse treatment. The Authors may add some additional information like food consumption (g for a day) and total caloric intake. How many grams of inulin are daily supplied to mice?</p>
<p>3. In Figure 1(D) the image of E3-control is missing.</p>
<p>4. The title of the article is inappropriate because the data reported are insufficient to claim a potential role of inulin for the Alzheimer disease. I suggest to remove "[&#8230;] relevant mouse model of preclinical Alzheimer's Disease" from the title.</p>
