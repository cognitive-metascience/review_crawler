<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr Reed,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>Although both the reviewers indicated an overall enthusiasm for the studies, it was however felt that further discussion and justifications/rationale&#160;for choosing certain compounds and their combination studies would be necessary.&#160;</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: The purpose of this study by Welch et al., was to define clinical agents that synergize with the LSD1 inhibitor SP2509 in Ewing sarcoma, an aggressive childhood cancer which has seen limited improvement in overall survival since the introduction of chemotherapy &gt;50 years ago. The authors tested 7 clinically utilized chemotherapeutic agents in four different Ewing sarcoma cell lines with varying KDM1A expression levels and TP53/STAG2 mutational status. Order of addition of second line conventional combination therapy agents were also tested with the addition of SP2509.</p>
<p>The authors should be commended on several factors including their reproducible and high throughput method for exploring antitumor effects of combinations of therapies at clinically achievable concentrations. All concentrations used in experiments were well below observed maximal plasma concentrations. In addition, it is refreshing to see that the authors used active metabolites of cyclophosphamide, irinotecan, and temozolomide which is frequently overlooked. As all experimental considerations for combination therapy were developed and conducted with the end thought of rapid translation into current LSD1 trials, data presented in this manuscript has the potential to significantly improve the survival outcomes for Ewing sarcoma patients as well as demonstrating to the scientific community how synergy experiments should be conducted. The data is technically sound with multiple replicates and each conclusion is supported by the data presented.</p>
<p>Minor comments for consideration</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>1) As synergism with SP2509 was the main premise for this study, the authors should explain why SP2509 was chosen over other LSD1 inhibitors (GSK2879552 and ORY-1001). It would be helpful to state in the introduction that SP2509 is currently in Phase I clinical testing for Ewing sarcoma patients (NCT03600649) and that Ewing sarcoma cell lines are resistant to reversible inhibitors (Romo&#8208;Morales et al., Pediatric Blood &amp; Cancer, 2019).</p>
<p>2) To prevent confusion, it should be noted in the text that SP2509 was formally known as HCI2509.</p>
<p>Results section</p>
<p>1) Minor concern for this study was the decision to use Romidepsin which is only clinically approved for T-cell lymphoma. Considering the Phase 2 clinical trial of Romidepsin (NCT00112463) failed in 40 patients with metastatic or unresectable sarcoma, what is the likely hood of this HDAC inhibitor being chosen for further study in solid tumors?</p>
<p>2) Reference is required for the following statement &#8220;HDAC1 and HDAC2 inhibitor romidepsin and the reversible LSD1 inhibitor SP2509, were selected based on their respective targets in the NuRD complex&#8221; Lines 171-172.</p>
<p>3) Figure 1: Viability time point should be listed in the figure legend ie 24 or 72hr treatment. Image quality is also quite poor and should be corrected.</p>
<p>4) The authors state on Line 200 that &#8220;SP2509 showed synergy with all drugs apart from vincristine&#8221;. Can the authors postulate why? Is anything known for the cell lines in terms of previous chemotherapy treatment and does this explain sensitivity/resistance to the agents tested?</p>
<p>5) On lines 285-286, the authors elude to sensitivity of drugs may &#8220;simply be due to differences in doubling times&#8221;. This is quite possible considering the doubling times for the majority of cell lines ranges from 21-25hrs except for RDES (60hrs) (May et al., PLOS ONE, 2013). The authors should include doubling rates for each cell line in Table 1.</p>
<p>6) Is there any correlation between sensitivity to SP2509 and the other chemotherapeutic agents tested?</p>
<p>7) With all the different dosing schedules and agents, it was quite difficult throughout the manuscript to track which agents were synergistic over multiple cell lines. It would be nice to present a final table/figure summarizing which agents where synergistic across all four Ewing sarcoma cell lines and dosing schedules.</p>
<p>8) Minor notes, gene names should be in italics eg Line 275 TP53 and STAG2.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>1) Do the authors know whether SP2509 and SP2577 have similar IC50 values? This will have implications as to whether their synergistic findings can be replicated with SP2577 in clinical settings.</p>
<p>2) Although not used for clinical settings in Ewing sarcoma, SP2509 has been shown to synergise with docetaxel in prostate cancer (Gupta et al., 2016). This study should be referenced.</p>
<p>3) The dosing model presented in Supplementary Figure 2 is quite interesting and should be moved to the main text.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This study describes in vitro 2D analyses of cell viability for drug combination indices of an HDAC and an LSD1 inhibitor combined with standard chemotherapies used for treatment of ewing sarcomas. Overall the experiments appear well executed and described.</p>
<p>Although this is clearly not a mechanistic paper, the authors should better consider and discuss</p>
<p>i. the reasons supporting their hypothesis &#8220;that agents that interact with components of the NuRD complex would work synergistically with agents already utilized in the treatment of ES&#8221;.</p>
<p>ii. the rationale behind the choice of HDAC and LSD1 inhibitors including recent comments about how SP2509 may work (PMID: 29205263 PMID:31207107)</p>
<p>iii. possible mechanistic explanations for the results of the most and least synergistic combinations in different cell lines. For example it has been published that cells with low EWS-FLI1 expression are less proliferative PMID:28135250. Does this impact on the sensitivity of the agents used? The mechanism of action of some chemotherapeutic agents used depends on rapid cell cycling, e.g. SN-38. Can this be considered in light of A673&#8217;s relative insensitivity to topoisomerases? comments/considerations around reversal of insensitivity of</p>
<p>iv. the importance of scheduling. They only do one sequential experiment in which the order of drugs is changed.</p>
<p>v. the importance around time of treatment. Activity is reported at 72hours, however drugs targeting epigenetic modifying enzymes have been shown to benefit from prolonged exposure (EZH2 inhibitors in lymphoma). Longer-term assays could be useful to achieve maximal drug efficacy and therefore give a broader overview of their activity in combination with chemotherapeutic agents.</p>
<p>vi. Given the previous effects of LSD1 on migration (PMID:18381423) and the potential clinical significance of this phenotype, why was this not assessed or discussed?</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>Page 3 line 44 sentence unclear &#8211; most commonly t(11;22)(q24;12) between the amino &#8230; &#8211; &#8220;12&#8221; should be q12 is missing and that fuses would be better than &#8220;between&#8221;</p>
