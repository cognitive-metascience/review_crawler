<p>A rapid detection tool for VT isolates of Citrus tristeza virus by immunocapture-reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Research Plant Pathologist Yokomi,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>Please see the Academic Editor Comments below.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Aug 02 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Ulrich Melcher</p>
<p>Academic Editor</p>

<p><bold>Journal Requirements:</bold></p>
<p>1. When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>We noticed you have some minor occurrence of overlapping text with the following previous publication(s), which needs to be addressed:</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PHYTO-100-4-0319" ns0:type="simple">https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PHYTO-100-4-0319</ext-link></p>

<p>In your revision ensure you cite all your sources (including your own works), and quote or rephrase any duplicated text outside the methods section. Further consideration is dependent on these concerns being addressed."</p>
<p>3. In your Methods section, please provide additional location information, including geographic coordinates for the data set if available.</p>
<p>4.We note that you have stated that you will provide repository information for your data at acceptance. Should your manuscript be accepted for publication, we will hold it until you provide the relevant accession numbers or DOIs necessary to access your data. If you wish to make changes to your Data Availability statement, please describe these changes in your cover letter and we will update your Data Availability statement to reflect the information you provide.</p>
<p><bold>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</bold></p>
<p>Please could you address the following comments before your manuscript is sent out for external review:</p>
<p>*************************************************</p>
<p>Generalities : The title mentions the VT strain, yet there are absolutely no references to VT genomic uniqueness especially in its 5'end as demonstrated already in 1996 following its complete sequencing (Mawassi et al 1996 ) and comparison with T36&#160; (Karasev et al, 1995). </p>
<p>Similarly nothing is mentioned on VT : &#160;unique biological characteristics, subdivision into &#160;different &#160;isolates reported which cause r both quick decline QD&#160; and stem pitting (SP), while  &#160;others cause &#160;SP &#160;of grapefruits with minimal or no effects on orange trees grafted on sour oranges. </p>
<p>On the specifics, the authors did mention previous reports &#160;on CTV genotyping by Northern Hybridization&#160; and sequential analyses of enzyme immunoassays and capillary electrophoresis-single-strand conformation polymorphisms. J Virol Methods. 181:139-47. </p>
<p>Furthermore in the above JVM paper&#160; tests were conducted on RNA recovered from positively &#160;reacting ELISA wells , thus directing genotyping only for the positively reacting citrus trees</p>
<p>A previous &#160;report on RT-LAMP assay for sensitive detection of CTV&#160; by Warghane in J Virol Methods. 2017 Dec;250:6-10. doi: 10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.09.018. Epub 2017 Sep 21 is also missing.&#160;</p>
