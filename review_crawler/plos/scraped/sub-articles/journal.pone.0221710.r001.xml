<p>Reviewer #1: General considerations</p>
<p>- Consistence BOSU &#174;</p>
<p>- There are very long sentences without full stops or commas.</p>
<p>- I would recommend to improve the wording, fluency (use connectors) and to be careful with the sections that include many acronyms, which difficult the understanding of the ideas (establish an order, make the method very clear, comparisons).</p>
<p>- An interesting article by Moras G. has been recently published.</p>
<p>- We suggest that it would more explicit in the bibliographical citations (results, type of sample, sport, more information).</p>
<p>Abtsract</p>
<p>Line 26-28: some pause in the sentence</p>
<p>Line 28: &#8216;different suspended lunges&#8217;. Clarify the meaning.</p>
<p>Line 30: Bosu (like in a methods section) more consistent. &#8216;&#174;&#8217;</p>
<p>Line 30: you didn&#8217;t define Vibro30 previously.</p>
<p>Line 31: males</p>
<p>Line 32: 24.40 _ space &#8216;&#177;&#8217;</p>
<p>Line 33: consistency , you don&#8217;t define the BOSU like an unstable Surface , you worte directly Vibro30, and then just electromiography, can you be more consistent.</p>
<p>Line 34: five&#8217;</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>We suggest to introduce a first part of functional exercises, differences, bilateral/ unilateral relationship, relations with performance / health (the area which you want to focus the proposal on), detail and justify exercises you&#8217;ve chosen. Shorten other sections. (line 57-75)&#8230;</p>
<p>and introduce in separate sections the different methods</p>
<p>- Inestability</p>
<p>- Vibration</p>
<p>- suspension</p>
<p>Line 48: Can you report some ref./ demands on?</p>
<p>Line 49-51: can you clarify this sentence</p>
<p>Line 51-53: some commas/full stops in the sentence</p>
<p>Line 53: can you report more ref, and more information&#8230;</p>
<p>Line 55: ref2 . in relation to upper body?</p>
<p>Line 56: ref 4, can you cite some more info (sample, gender, athlets&#8230;)</p>
<p>Line 56:</p>
<p>- you could connect this phrase and make it clearear.</p>
<p>- 'promising markers' you can use different terminology than the original article</p>
<p>- can you report the tests and the sample T-Test, sprint 10m&#8230;.</p>
<p>Line 57: Different authors disagree wiht the comparisons in different levels of participants (Maloney et al).. we consider that it should introduce a sentence, in relation to which the level of the participants can become a limitation in the results ... methods .....</p>
<p>Line 57-63. All the paragraph are related to the ref. 6?</p>
<p>Line 59. Can you support this idea with references ..(Comfort, P&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Line 63. Before &#8216;Perfoming&#8217;, can you introduce some connectors in this sentence.</p>
<p>Line 66: order and calrify the sentence</p>
<p>Line 63-65: can you cite more information (methods to analyse these activation, all the muscles involved in concentric/eccentric phase in the same %, and in the same function)</p>
<p>Line 69: Little &#191; can you improve this</p>
<p>Line 70: in bulgarian squat?</p>
<p>Line 69-72: can you rewrite and try to make it more fluent.</p>
<p>Line 73: hamstrings? Can you be more precisley</p>
<p>Line 76: can you report the diferences why (this transferability in sport line 58)) , for example differences in unilateral and bilateral; vectors force; can you report examples, relations with a &#8230; performance, (health,techinque)</p>
<p>Line 85: exercises? Can you report more information</p>
<p>Line 100-104: Can you write in a clear and concrete way.</p>
<p>Line 118-119: can you justify why you add this ref, and can you report more data in relation these studies (in upper body)</p>
<p>Line 123: you explain the effects in muscle activation, and to &#8216;decreased force output&#8217;, but I recommended to explain the positive effects in neuromuscular control?</p>
<p>Line 128, can you cite some ref?</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Line 151-154: some pause in the sentence, and repport more information and clarify the idea</p>
<p>Line 164: could be influnced by the difference of age 20-31 in the results , could be influenced by the experience , sport, in the results?</p>
<p>Line 168: can you repport more information</p>
<p>Procedures</p>
<p>Line 184: could you explain the familiarisation procedures</p>
<p>Line 189: ref? dominance?</p>
<p>if it&#8217;s posible can you disscuss (not in the text) why this test and not another one.</p>
<p>The analyzed capacity (exercise) could influence the dominance (Bishop, C, and another recent authors ...)</p>
<p>We believe that dominance could have been determined with the same task previously. This could be a limitation of the study.</p>
<p>Excuse me, but I haven&#8217;t been able to find which legs are being analyzed (we understand that the dominant leg) it could improve the explanation of the leg analyzed in the text..and in different sections.</p>
<p>If you have only analyzed the dominant leg, do not consider analyzing the non-dominant leg in the future and establish the differences, asymmetries, and the behavior of dom / non-dom legs in different situations?</p>
<p>Line 204-208 can you rewrite</p>
<p>Line 357: Why don&#8217;t use the newer scale?</p>
<p>(Cohen d &lt; 0.2 = trivial; 0.2-0.6 = small; 0.6-1.2 = moderate; 1.2-2.0 = large; &gt; 2.0 = very large)</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>I recommend adding the scales or results of the differences found, as well as the results of the studies you are comparing, to see the comparison.</p>
<p>We also recommend to add more information from the comparative studies, in relation to the sample, sports</p>
<p>Line 438: than 'the' bulgarian</p>
<p>Line 174: the vibration does not provide other benefits? you could add some information that explains the benefits in other 'systems'</p>
<p>Line 477-493: the same idea is repeated on several occasions, could you clarify it and bemore precise. This part should to be considerably shorter.</p>
<p>Line 505-508: can rewrite</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>In the introduction, note the importance of adaptations to a specific level. Do you consider that a limitation might not apply functional tests?</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Summary of the research</p>
<p>This research study aims to compare the muscle activity and force production of different exercise conditions (bulgarian squat, suspended lunge, suspended lunge with instability and suspended lunge with two different vibration frequencies). The topic is interesting; however the study has significant flaws and requires major and minor revisions in order to meet the journal&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p>Major issues</p>
<p>Abstract section.</p>
<p>First of all, while the study is interesting, the structure of the abstract is unclear, making it difficult to follow. I advise the authors to re-write the abstract section in order to clarify primary and secondary aims of the study and how they were approached to improve the flow and readability of the text. At the last paragraph of the introduction section appears to be clearer than in the abstract section.</p>
<p>Secondly, when authors mention differences found, it would be helpful to report the magnitude of this differences and the exact p values in order to allow the reader to evaluate clinical significance of the results.</p>
<p>Minor issues</p>
<p>Introduction section.</p>
<p>Lines 56 and 57.</p>
<p>The authors stated &#8220;Unstable surfaces have also been used to strengthen the lower body and have been demonstrated as promising markers of athletic performance in sprint and agility&#8221;, however the reference used (Cressey 2007), would not be appropriate. While results in sprint and T-test improved as cited, these improvements were always much lower than the stable group and the other variables assessed obtained impaired results. In fact, the author himself concludes &#8220;These results indicate that unstable training using inflatable rubber discs attenuates performance improvements in healthy, trained athletes. Such implements have proved valuable in rehabilitation, but caution should be exercised when applying unstable training to athletic performance and general exercise scenarios&#8221;. I would suggest to use another reference to justify their argument.</p>
<p>Lines 82-84</p>
<p>The authors stated: &#8220;&#8230;and the beneficial effects of WBV have been demonstrated in lower limb exercises (squat, half squat, Bulgarian squat or lunge) (15,16)&#8221;, however the vast majority of the participants in this references were untrained or post-menopausal making it difficult to extrapolate their results to other populations, this fact should be annotated.</p>
<p>Procedures section</p>
<p>Line 188</p>
<p>The authors determined the leg dominance of the participants but nothing else is explained about how this characteristic is used at the protocol of the study.</p>
<p>Line 207</p>
<p>The words &#8220;complementary methods&#8221; should be corrected by &#8220;complementary means of training&#8221;. Suspension, unstable surface and WBV are instruments used in order to apply a training load not a systematic approach to overload the athlete.</p>
<p>Exercise trials section</p>
<p>In order not to be confusing, it should be annotated that the participants executed the exercise only with their own bodyweight as a load.</p>
<p>Related to this, the fact of using the same absolute intensity in all exercises (bodyweight), implies that different relative intensities were used at the different conditions of the study. The most convenient way in order to compare the effects of instability, suspension and vibration conditions would have been to use the same relative load, at least in terms of load lifted, in all exercises. This is a limitation to be annotated.</p>
<p>Results section</p>
<p>Lines 383 y 384</p>
<p>The authors stated: &#8220;The suspended lunge provided the lowest activations for BF, Gmed, VM, VL, Global_FL and Global among the conditions&#8221;. The sentence is correct at descriptive level, but pairwise comparisons&#8217; p values of table 2 does not reflect the same and it has not been mentioned or analysed in text either. For example, none of the EMG values of the suspended lunge condition achieve significant differences respect to Bulgarian squat.</p>
<p>Discusion section</p>
<p>Line 420</p>
<p>The authors stated: &#8220;The lower muscle activation of suspended lunges compared to Bulgarian squats for the RF_RL, BF, Gmed, VM, and VL (but not the RF_FL) reinforces this argument&#8221;. But any significant analysis is reported and % difference of Gmed and VM shown in fig 2 seems not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Line 422</p>
<p>The authors stated: &#8220;All suspended lunge conditions increase RF_FL activity in comparison with the Bulgarian squat&#8221;. But any significant analysis is reported and % difference shown in fig. 2 seems not significant.</p>
<p>Line 433</p>
<p>The authors stated: "Regarding the rest of the FL muscles, BF, VM, VL, and Gmed showed a greater activity under Bulgarian squat condition, as reported in previous studies (8&#8211;10)&#8221;. In table 2 seems to be non-statistically significant.</p>
