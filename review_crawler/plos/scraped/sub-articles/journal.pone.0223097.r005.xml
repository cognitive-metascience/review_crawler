<p>1. The sentence containing "and the validity of IQVIA data has been assessed in&#160;other &#160;jurisdictions...&#8230;" should include the&#160;fact that &#160;these assessments were done within Canada in patients of all ages....&#160;&#160;which had been previously requested but&#160; was not added&#160;&#160;.Its placement in the Discussion is fine .</p>
<p>2. The references remain incomplete with several case and alignment errors. Please correct them as previously&#160;&#160;requested.. </p>
