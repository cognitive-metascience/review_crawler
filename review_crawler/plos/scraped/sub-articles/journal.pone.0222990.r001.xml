<p>Reviewer #1: The authors investigate how the molecular chaperone Hsp70 binds a client protein, PGK, during heat shock. Their FRET studies show that while binding is non-specific in the test tube, there is some specific binding in cells that likely occurs as hydrophobic regions in PGK are exposed during heating. This manuscript provides an important glimpse into how the Hsp70 class of molecular chaperones protect proteins from heat shock in cells and should be published after some revisions.</p>
<p>Equations 5 accounts for the unfolded state of the client protein, the chaperone bound client protein and the aggregates of the client-chaperone complex. But, especially under heat shock one might expect the unbound client to aggregate even when not chaperone bound. Is there a reason to exclude this aggregated species from the analysis?</p>
<p>The PGK Construct: The Hsp70 and Hsp40 constructs used for these experiments are the human molecular chaperones, but the PGK construct is from yeast. What is the percent identity between human PGK and the wild-type PGK construct used in these experiments? Also, for figure 8, how were the green "hydrophobic patches" identified? Do these regions overlap with regions that might bind Hsp70 based on the Limbo server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://limbo.switchlab.org/limbo-analysis" ns0:type="simple">http://limbo.switchlab.org/limbo-analysis</ext-link>)? The Limbo server is based on the binding propensities of the E. coli Hsp70 DnaK, nonetheless, these predictions might be useful in considering what regions of PGK might be involved in binding human HspA1A.</p>
<p>In Figure 2, the authors show that the Hsp70/Hsp40 system can improve PGK refolding efficiency following denaturation in guanidine hydrochloride and they use these data to conclude "Thus, PGK1 refolding from denaturant is chaperoned by Hsp70 and eukaryotic PGK is an Hsp70 substrate." However, they later show that at elevated temperature in vitro interactions between PGK and Hsp70 are non-specific. Thus, it seems possible that the more efficient refolding also arises due to a non-specific interaction. Does the K71M Hsp70 mutant have the same effect? (If this experiment was not performed it is sufficient to replace "is an Hsp70 substrate" with something like "appears to be..")</p>
<p>Page 2 line 59: "ATP hydrolysis is induced by substrate binding&#8230;.."</p>
<p>This description is not quite correct. Hsp70s have a basal rate of ATP hydrolysis which is increased (stimulated) by substrate binding.</p>
<p>Page 4 lines 106-107 "There is a precedent for such native state binding activity for the Hsp70 homolog DnaK, where the chaperone binds to full-length native proteins in force-unfolding experiments [25]."</p>
<p>This reference is not correct &#8211; likely it should be reference 24.</p>
<p>Page 6 Line 179: "Tryptophan was excited at 295 nm, and emission spectra were collected from 290 to 450 nm."</p>
<p>Either the excitation wavelength or emission range is likely incorrect.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The authors compare in-vitro and in-cell measurements of heat shock proteins binding to</p>
<p>its substrate and find specific differences. They attribute these differences to in-cell</p>
<p>conditions that promote a 'preemptive holdase' mechanism for the chaperone to bind and not</p>
<p>promote unfolding. The experiments have been performed carefully and the manuscript is</p>
<p>written well. I have the following minor comments:</p>
<p>1) The authors should report the fitting errors for the various parameters including Tm, T0,</p>
<p>fast phase and slow phase time-constants.</p>
<p>2) How are the surface exposed sites identified in Figure 8?</p>
<p>3) It would be good to provide a cartoon that summarizes the result given that multiple proteins</p>
<p>and conditions have been explored.</p>
<p>4) The amplitudes of the unfolding curves are very different. Do they have any mechanistic</p>
<p>origins in terms of binding or folding or aggregation?</p>
