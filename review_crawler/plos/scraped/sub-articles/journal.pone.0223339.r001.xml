<p>Reviewer #1: Ganguly et al. investigated the transcytosis of silica nanoparticles across alveolar epithelial cells. To perform these experiments they used a novel combination of techniques including intravital microscopy, TEM, whole organ imaging, and in vitro studies. The modification to inverted lung microscopy to include partial liquid ventilation to image the nanoparticles is interesting from a technical/experimental point of view. Also the use of relatively inert silica nanoparticles that have their kinetic profiles already established was a strength of the study and removed some factors such as inflammation, edema, and other toxicity that may have occurred with use of another particle type. The use of TiO2 nanoparticles was able to validate their findings from silica exposures.</p>
<p>Comments</p>
<p>1. The materials sections states that 4 silica nanoparticle sizes were purchased. It is unclear in specific experiments which nanoparticle was utilized. For example, in the in vitro assessment of A549 cell internalization it only states the concentration not the size. Although mentioned within the materials the 30 and 500 nm nanoparticles do not appear to have been used.</p>
<p>2. The characterization of the nanoparticles is sufficient and well done.</p>
<p>3. The results as written include a large amount of discussion. These portions need to be moved to the discussion. As currently written the discussion is lacking in depth.</p>
<p>4. Figures 2C, 3G, and 4E include graphs with error bars. These figures lack statistical analysis. Please perform statistical assessments of these data to establish if differences are significant. Also add a section into the methods detailing statistical information such as group sizes, statistical tests, and threshold of significance.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript &#8220;In vivo clearance of nanoparticles by transcytosis across alveolar epithelial cells&#8221; by Ganguly, et al, is well-written and describes research I believe would be of interest to the readership of PLOS One. The mechanisms by which nanoscale particles move from the alveolar space to systemic circulation is not fully understood and this manuscript provides impactful insight into this topic.</p>
<p>I have some minor revisions I would recommend before publication in PLOS One:</p>
<p>1) While the hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticle agglomerates formed in this study was measured for PBS and culture medium, this agglomeration size is missing for the perfluorocarbon vehicle used in the partial liquid ventilation. Given the importance of this portion of the manuscript to the conclusions being drawn, it is critical that some measure of agglomeration in PFC is made. It is not described in the methods section what device was used to measure these diameters, but the Malvern Zetasizer can also be used for organic solvents.</p>
<p>2) The manuscript does not make a convincing case that significant amounts of nanomaterial are not being caught/cleared by the mucociliary escalator, especially since this method of clearance is widely established for micro-scale/fine particles. The assertion that &#8220;the particles do not leave the area via the airways&#8221; relies on the 60um z-stack in figure 2, suggesting that there are more particles in the alveolar sacs than in the ducts. However, large percentages of particle agglomerates should be getting caught in the conducting airways before they reach the alveolar ducts (as this is their purpose), and this effect would be even more pronounced in human lungs where there is more branching. The manuscript should include some discussion on the relative proportions of inhaled nanoparticle agglomerates which reach the alveolar space vs that which is cleared by the conducting airways.</p>
<p>3) Related to the previous point, the clearance of particles by mucociliary action would put them into the gastrointestinal tract, providing a new potential point of entry into systemic circulation. While it is unlikely that the GI tracts of the study mice are still available for analysis, some discussion into why the authors believe that alveolar uptake is a more important contributor to systemic nanoparticle circulation than GI uptake would be warranted.</p>
<p>4) Nanosilica is known to be cytotoxic and causes redox stress in most other in vitro research. It is recommended that, at the least, some measure of cytotoxicity at study doses be provided in the supplementary information. Some discussion on the justification for using the doses applied in this study (as in, comparisons to &#8220;real world&#8221; exposures) as well as why no cytotoxicity or inflammation was observed (what doses would cause these effects and are they realistic exposures?) would be helpful to establish the relevance of the manuscript.</p>
<p>5) More speculatively, it is surprising to me that a &#8220;fast track&#8221; mechanism for transporting inhaled particles in bulk to the bloodstream/lymph would even exist, given how many other safeguards are in place to prevent exactly that. I am curious to hear the author&#8217;s opinions on why such a mechanism might exist and what purpose this would serve the animal.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: The authors studied the mechanism of silica nanoparticles (50 nm) to get cleared by crossing the lung epithelium within 30 minutes. The authors presented fluorescence data and TEM showing the particles in transcytosis. This is an interesting observation, however, more proof is needed on this clearance pathway.</p>
<p>1. Amorphous Silica has been shown to be soluble in the presence of salts and proteins, the authors should test the dissolution rate of the these nanoparticles in physiologically relevant lung fluid. This is important because fluorescent labels may be released to cause an artifact of particle clearance.</p>
<p>2. More quantitative method of clearance is the ICP-MS, especially for the silica with silver cores, which could give more accurate data than fluorescence.</p>
<p>3. Transcytosis is often mentioned, but rarely a detailed pathway is described. This study lacks a mechanistic understanding other than an interesting phenomenon.</p>
