<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: This paper attempts to provide evidence to change clinical practice in the USA - that being the necessity of performing routine week 1 post op check up following uneventful cataract surgery, when no issues have been identified at day 1 post op. They recommend a questionnaire in which a technician could administer over the phone to reduce unnecessary appointments at which management was not seen to change.</p>
<p>The intention of the work is good, and it is a reasonable attempt to objectively direct post op follow up phone consultations. The questions are simple and clear, and the impact on the study population seems to be valid.</p>
<p>Few comments: in this study population with these 5 surgeons at this institution, there was a 1 in 3 chance of a problem identified at the day 1 post op review &#8211; this seems exceptionally high (and was the reason for exclusion in the study). This should be explained in more detail.</p>
<p>It should be unsurprising that due to modern techniques, cataract surgery in routine cases should not have significant issues in the post operative period, and so a validated questionnaire should be able to identify any deviation from this expectation (and therefore pick up cases who may have CMO or endophthalmitis).</p>
<p>The paper is a useful addition to the American literature, but in other parts of the world cataract patients with uneventful surgery and no co-morbidity concerns are not seen at day 1, week 1 and in some instances are only reviewed by their optometrist 6 weeks later. While I am not advocating the pros and cons of this, one could argue there is no evidence base for or against these arbitrary time points aside from the fear of CMO or endophthalmitis. In light of this, these authors should be commended for providing an evidence base to change or direct clinical practice. Their questionnaire may be the first steps in rationalising this practice of review schedules.</p>
<p>However, in many other countries which are not so closely linked to insurance based systems as the USA, the ship has already sailed.</p>
<p>This article could have the message "questionnaire means no more week 1 check ups!") so is a valid cost saving message, if the authors could specifically calculate how using this survey impacted on costs to the patient.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This is a well packaged message highlighting the optimal follow-up schedule after cataract surgery, nice reading prior work and how this fits in their overall work.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: This is a very well written article that questions the current recommended followup schedule after uncomplicated cataract surgery. The study suggests a useful and simple questionnaire to be conducted via virtual visit which can help eliminate postoperative week 1 visit. The sensitivity of the study was excellent at 100%. What was the specificity of the study?</p>
<p>Line 70: The sentence should read as &#8220; Most commonly in the United states, the patients are seen postoperatively on day 1, one week, and one month after cataract surgery.</p>
<p>Line 74: Can you please be specific about couple of weeks? It can be 4-6 weeks after surgery.</p>
<p>Methods: It is important to mention that this is a prospective cohort study here. Also the informed consent should be discussed at the beginning of methods rather than at the end of methods section.</p>
<p>Line 111: The sentence can be re written as &#8220;The study population comprised of patients &#8230;.informed consent.&#8221;.</p>
<p>Line 118: Figure 1 can be moved to results section. Also it is important to explain ROC figure since it is not very self explanatory. It is not clear what the numbers stand for.</p>
<p>Please write figure legends for all the figures at the end of the article</p>
