<p>&lt;Response to the comments of the reviewer #1&gt;</p>
<p>Reviewer #1:</p>
<p>#1.This is a nice study combining two prospective registries. The study is providing new and valuable data. The references are perhaps missing European registries&#8217;data.</p>
<p>The paper is nicely written and very informative, the discussion is really nice and the figures are clean. </p>
<p>We appreciate your comment. As we mentioned in text, to evaluate the clinical benefit of TAVI compared with conservative therapy have been still important for clinical decision. Not only randomized control trials but also real-world data was important regarding about this problem. </p>
<p>We added the following description and reference from European registries&#8217; reference in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>Discussion (Page 18, Line 25 to Page 19, Line 1)</p>

<p>#2.Perhaps the text is a bit too long? It could be shorten to provide more data on subgroups with figures.</p>
<p>Thank you for your comment. In my text, we described introduction, materials and methods, results and discussion. We described details of the materials and methods because of this complex methodology, and both results and discussion had important message in our study.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in subgroup analysis, we only wanted to demonstrate consistency about primary outcomes, and we did not aim to obtain new finding from subgroup analysis.</p>
<p>#3.It appears that the study is not including patients with any low gradient, low flow AS? That is a pity and adding a specific analysis on this group of patients could be even more original and valuable as no strong data are available yet.</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comment. In this study, we also included patients with low gradient AS. However, we did not have data of stroke volume , so we could not identify patients with low flow, low gradient severe AS. </p>
<p>#4.The EF is looked according to cut-off of 40 and 50% but the recent literature is underscoring the difference between 60 or 55% versus below: could the authors provide these data and the Kaplan Meier curves according to EF above of below 55% when the patients are treated or not?.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your valuable suggestion. Cut-off of 40 and 50% were used in prior our study and we adopted the same value. These days, in the field of heart failure, heart failure with mid- range ejection fraction was hot topic and this was defined as EF 40-49%. We set also heart failure hospitalization as one of primary endpoint in this study. Regarding this point, our group consider that the cut-off point 40 and 50 were reasonable. However, for post-hoc analysis, we conducted Kaplan Meier curves according to EF above or below 55% and cumulative incidence and adjusted hazard ratio divided by EF 55 and 60% in "Response to reviewer file" added on the end of "revised file". </p>
<p>The results of both cut-off points were consistent with cut-off of 50%.</p>
<p>#5.The COPD is strikingly different between groups: comments..</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments.</p>
<p>As you pointed out, much more patients had chronic lung disease in the TAVI group than in the conservative group. We consider this was because TAVI procedure in this study was at the early experience after introduction of TAVI in Japan. In this era, Japanese physicians selected TAVI when patients have high risk of surgical aortic valve replacement because of comorbidities like chronic lung disease. This is proof that 29.5% of the patients who underwent TAVI had moderate and severe COPD in Japanese National TAVI registry [1]. However, after propensity score matched cohort, the difference of rate of moderate or severe chronic lung disease was set off.</p>
<p>#6.The ischemic heart disease: comments?</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments.</p>
<p>As you pointed out, patients in the TAVI group had more coronary artery disease than in the conservative group. We consider this is because before TAVI procedure, cardiologist in Japan usually underwent coronary angiography, therefore coronary artery disease more tended to detect. However, after propensity score matched cohort, the difference of rate of coronary artery disease was set off.</p>
<p>#7.Is it expected to have such a low rate of AF in such elderly patients? This is strikingly different for USA and Europe.</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments.</p>
<p>In studies of USA and Europe country regarding TAVI procedure, the prevalence of AF in patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI was about 40%, and this is strikingly different for our data. There was a study that prevalence of atrial fibrillation in the general population of Japan was lower than USA [2]. In addition, another TAVI registry in Japan showed that only 20% of the patients who underwent TAVI had atrial fibrillation [3]. We consider that the prevalence of AF was lower than US data even in such elderly patients.</p>

<p>&lt;Response to the comments of the reviewer #2&gt;</p>
<p>Reviewer #2:</p>
<p>In this observational retrospective study authors aimed at comparing TAVI to medical treatment using historical cohort data. The study is not timely since the question asked has been previously answered in much more robust studies. However, it could still be interesting regarding the long-term differences between the two groups. But authors should provide a more robust methodological and statistical approach and would benefit from simplification (the sensitivity and subgroup analyses provide little new insight).</p>
<p>#1.Not a timely study, as attested by the use of Sapien XT valves, 37% of alternative access, with probably transapical as first alternative (Results page 22 &#8220;trans-femoral approach was selected only in 63% of patients&#8221;) with a comparator based on a historical pre-TAVI era cohort. Must be clearly stated that comparison is not applicable to current clinical practice</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your valuable suggestion. As you pointed out, this study compared TAVI with early experience in Japan and conservative therapy in before introduction TAVI. About 37% of patients who underwent TAVI were selected alternative approach and almost all patients were undergone TAVI under general anesthesia. This is not applicable to current TAVI practice ,although we consider that the data of early experience was important to evaluate long-term results over 2 years. </p>
<p>We added the following statement regarding the difference from current clinical practice in the limitations section.</p>
<p>Limitations (Page 21, Line 9 to Page 21, Line 12)</p>
<p>Fifth, patients who underwent TAVI were early experience data in Japan, therefore about 37% of patients were selected alternative approach and almost all patients underwent TAVI under general anesthesia. This is quite different from current TAVI practice and this could not applicable to current TAVI practice.</p>
<p>#2.Method page 15 &#8220;We also excluded those patients &#8230; might also be contraindicated for TAVI&#8221; Authors should clarify what patients were excluded here and reformulate this statement because TAVI is a clear indication for a large proportion of patients which are contraindicated to SAVR. Please also clarify the flow chart figure 1 with regard to the box &#8220;conservative group with formal indication of AVR &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We excluded patients who were considered to be contraindicated aortic valve replacement (TAVI or SAVR) because of malnutrition, muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, and expected poor prognosis due to morbidities other than heart disease.</p>
<p>For detail, 146 patients excluded contraindicated because of malnutrition (61 patients) , muscle weakness (26 patients), cognitive impairment (101 patients), and 46 patients excluded because of expected poor prognosis due to morbidities other than heart disease.</p>
<p>We added this details of exclusion you suggested to method, and modified Fig 1  in "Response to reviewer file" added on the end of "revised file".</p>
<p>Materials and Methods (Page 8, Line 10 to Page 8, Line 12)</p>
<p>We also excluded those patients who were regarded as contraindicated for SAVR by the attending physicians (malnutrition, muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, and expected poor prognosis), because these patients were considered to be contraindicated for TAVI.</p>
<p>The detail of &#8220;conservative group with formal indication of AVR&#8221; was written below in the same box in Figure 1.</p>
<p>The formal indication of AVR were symptomatic patients, asymptomatic patients with Vmax&gt;=5m/, or asymptomatic patient with LVEF&lt;50% mentioned in AHA/ACC Guideline [1].</p>
<p>We clearly described as below.</p>
<p>Materials and Methods (Page 8, Line 6 to Page 8, Line 9)</p>
<p>we excluded those patients on hemodialysis (HD) in whom TAVI has not been yet approved in Japan, and those asymptomatic patients with Vmax &lt;5m/s and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;=50%, who are regarded as candidates for watchful waiting according to the guidelines</p>
<p>#3.Statistical analysis page 17 &#8220;Because some variables were not well balanced &#8230; further adjustment by using the Cox proportional hazard models&#8221; In case of PS matching failure please consider removing PS matching step and apply multivariable Cox upfront. </p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. </p>
<p>In this study, we combined two different studies and the difference of baseline characteristics between two groups was significant. Regarding this problem, we discussed with statistician and decided to use PS matching. The statistical method of using cox proportional hazard model with residual variables to adjust after PS matching have been conducted in prior studies [2][3][4].</p>
<p>To confirm robustness of PS matching method, we also conducted cox proportional hazard models as sensitivity analysis, and the results were consistent with PS matching.</p>
<p>#4.Statistical analysis &#8220;We also performed subgroup analyses in terms of age, sex, STS score, LVEF, and high/low gradient AS in the propensity-score matched cohort&#8221; As reported by authors, the PS matching failed, therefore building subgroups for this cohort is likely to provide biased results.</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. </p>
<p>To adjust residual confounders, we also conducted cox proportional hazard model after PS matching for subgroup analyses. As you pointed out, there were not new finding in subgroup analysis. Our aim to conduct subgroup analysis was to confirm consistency of results about primary outcomes.</p>
<p>#5 Please consider separating all-cause mortality and HR rehospitalization all over the manuscript. Those 2 outcomes have little in common and the database is likely able to provide these data.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. In the study, primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, but these were not composite endpoint. In our study, these two outcomes described respectively.</p>
<p>#6.Please provide information regarding TAVI procedural characteristics in a Table: valves used, labels/generations, pathways, TEE use, general versus local anaesthesia, complications, etc</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your comment. We described TAVI procedural characteristics in S2 Table below. We show reference table in "Response to reviewer file" added on the end of "revised file".</p>
<p>We described approach site, procedure time, valve size, type of anesthesia, ECMO and complications. However, we did not have data about TEE use.</p>
