<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>

<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: This is a well-written paper and an important topic. The authors leveraged unique data sources to investigate CVD risk in those with severe mental illnesses (SMI). There are some concerns of the manuscript that limit its impact in its current form, as discussed in detail below. The three major concerns are the lack of clarity on the study population, the definition of SMI, and the lack of a proposed mechanism of the association between SMI and CVD events. The total number of participants in the PREDICT study was not provided nor was the way the investigators ended up with the analytic study population. It would help to show a diagram of the data sources and how the participants flowed into the final study population. The methods on page 4, line 84 state that data from 522,969 participants were included, but the tables show ~434,109. The other concern is with the ascertainment and definition of SMI. Could the authors comment on how accurate contact with specialist mental health services correlate to a SMI? It could be possible that people have depression or another SMI, but do not seek help from a specialist. Additionally, the definition of SMI is general and the diagnoses are missing. Both of these concerns could lead to misclassification of the exposure. If the authors conclude that SMI should be incorporated in CVD risk prediction tools, what variable should the tools use given the lack of SMI definitions in this analysis. Lastly, the paper would benefit from a proposed mechanism, which could vary depending on the specific SMI.</p>
<p>Minor areas of improvement for the authors to consider that could strengthen the paper are discussed below.</p>
<p>1. Do the authors compare the observed risk using the QRISK3 score that includes SMI?</p>
<p>2. Was there perfect linkage between the data sources?</p>
<p>3. The authors mention there was no loss to follow up, except for those who left the country. Could the authors provide the N?</p>
<p>4. How many events occurred and what are the sample sizes for the estimates in the figures?</p>
<p>5. Figure 1 shows the patterns of CVD events over 8 years. What is the rationale for showing 8 years?</p>
<p>6. Including those who had contact with a specialist mental health service, but did not have a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder is confusing. As mentioned, it is due to lack of data, but labeling those individuals as having a SMI is problematic.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This is a valuable article investigating the prediction of cardiovascular disease risk among people with severe mental illness. The paper reports that the PREDICT equations underestimated the risk for this group, with a mean observed: predicted risk ratio of 1.29 in men and 1.64 in women. This is a valuable paper that presents evidence of underestimating risk of CVD risk assessment tools in patients with severe mental illness.</p>
<p>I have the following concerns.</p>
<p>1. Discussion. P15, line 263. &#8220;hazard ratio of 1.[13]&#8221;</p>
<p>I think square brackets are unnecessary.</p>
<p>2. Discussion.</p>
<p>Whereas updated QRISK3 considers atypical antipsychotics and severe mental illness as risk factors, QRISK2 did not include them. I want to know if New Zealand people have plans to upgrade the PREDIC algorithm in the near future. If so, the findings of this study will be a great help.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I enjoyed reading this paper. This is a valuable paper that presents evidence of underestimating risk of CVD risk assessment tools in patients with severe mental illness.</p>
