<p>Time-related immunomodulation by stressors and corticosterone transdermal application in toads</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Monteiro Titon,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p>ACADEMIC EDITOR: This is a sound and very well-written manuscript on the effects of different stressors and of corticosterone on immune responses in toads. Based on the reviewers' comments below, the manuscript will require minor revisions, especially in relation to the times and locations of sampling, the consideration of body size in some of the&#160;assessments, and the&#160;discussion of the effects of corticosterone transdermal application on immune responses.&#160;</p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Sep 22 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: 307: Please explain why the sampling dates (years) are spreaded so much ?</p>
<p>308: Why sampling was done across different locations ?</p>
<p>313: I can see ethics approval for 2013 and 2016 only. Did this ethics approval cover the 2018 sampling as well ?</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This study examines temporal changes in immune responses and plasma corticosterone levels following restraint, captivity, and corticosterone administration in toads. Given the multiple immune responses that were measured (neutrophil: lymphocyte ratios, plasma bacterial killing ability, phagocytic activity of peritoneal cells, and phytohemagglutinin swelling response) and the various time frames in which they were measured, this study represents one of the most thorough studies on the topic in amphibians. Overall, the results indicate that short term stress enhances immune function while long-term stress suppresses immune function. The paper is well written and the introduction and results are clear and well thought out. I only have a few comments/questions that are specified below:</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Line 316. Correct &#8220;toads were located by visually and captured by hand&#8221;.</p>
<p>The relationship between body mass and CORT was examined but was body size measured? I&#8217;m wondering how the authors accounted for differences in mass that were attributable to size. For example, there was no relationship between body mass and CORT (Line 359 and elsewhere) but would it be better to examine body condition estimates that factor in size differences?</p>
<p>Line 451. How many CORT assays were run? Were the assays validated for this species?</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Line 99. Body mass was not manipulated so it would be better to state that there was no relationship between body mass and the measured variables. What was the direction of the relationship with PHA?</p>
<p>Line 102. How were toads with high and low initial CORT levels delineated (i.e., how did you determine the cutoff point)?</p>
<p>Line 111. Rephrase to state that CORT levels were 14 times higher in TA-treated toads compared to controls.</p>
<p>CORT levels increased dramatically in TA-treated toads (Fig 1E). The authors mention the upper limits of CORT in this species following severe dehydration (line 221), but can the authors comment about the natural range of CORT levels and whether the effects on immune responses (especially PHA measures shown in Fig. 4C) actually occur within the natural range of CORT levels (i.e., CORT levels in the TA treatment group is still quite a bit higher than the upper limits reported)?</p>
<p>Line 125. Of the 9 individuals wherein NLR was measured after constraint (Fig. 2A), do these represent individuals that showed an increase or decrease in CORT levels during constraint (see Fig. 1 A and B)?</p>
<p>**********</p>
