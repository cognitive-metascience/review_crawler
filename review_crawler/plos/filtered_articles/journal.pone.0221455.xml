<abstract>
<p>Hepatic iron overload, a hallmark of hereditary hemochromatosis, triggers progressive liver disease. There is also increasing evidence for a pathogenic role of iron in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. Mouse models of hereditary hemochromatosis and NAFLD can be used to explore potential interactions between iron and lipid metabolic pathways. Hfe-/- mice, a model of moderate iron overload, were reported to develop early liver fibrosis in response to a high fat diet. However, this was not the case with Hjv-/- mice, a model of severe iron overload. These data raised the possibility that the <italic>Hfe</italic> gene may protect against liver injury independently of its iron regulatory function. Herein, we addressed this hypothesis in a comparative study utilizing wild type, Hfe-/-, Hjv-/- and double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- mice. The animals, all in C57BL/6J background, were fed with high fat diets for 14 weeks and developed hepatic steatosis, associated with iron overload. Hfe co-ablation did not sensitize steatotic Hjv-deficient mice to liver injury. Moreover, we did not observe any signs of liver inflammation or fibrosis even in single steatotic Hfe-/- mice. Ultrastructural studies revealed a reduced lipid and glycogen content in Hjv-/- hepatocytes, indicative of a metabolic defect. Interestingly, glycogen levels were restored in double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- mice, which is consistent with a metabolic function of Hfe. We conclude that hepatocellular iron excess does not aggravate diet-induced steatosis to steatohepatitis or early liver fibrosis in mouse models of hereditary hemochromatosis, irrespectively of the presence or lack of Hfe.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome (type 2 diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension), and constitutes the most frequent liver disease in Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref002">2</xref>]. NAFLD is characterized by excessive fat accumulation in hepatocytes in the absence of other causes of liver disease, such as alcohol abuse or viral hepatitis. In approximately 30% of patients, NAFLD progresses from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a chronic inflammatory condition that may further lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD patients often exhibit perturbed iron metabolism and accumulate liver iron deposits, which increases the risk for liver fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref004">4</xref>]. Consequently, manipulation of iron metabolic pathways may offer a promising therapeutic target for NAFLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Systemic iron balance is controlled by hepcidin, a liver-derived iron regulatory hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref006">6</xref>]. Hepcidin limits iron efflux to the bloodstream by binding to the iron exporter ferroportin in tissue macrophages, intestinal enterocytes and other target cells, which leads to ferroportin internalization and degradation. The expression of hepcidin is induced in response to iron stores, inflammatory signals and other stimuli. Iron regulation of hepcidin involves bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and the SMAD signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref007">7</xref>]. Genetic defects in the hepcidin pathway underlie the development of hereditary hemochromatosis, an endocrine disorder of systemic iron overload that is caused by loss of feedback regulation in iron absorption and systemic iron traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref009">9</xref>]. The most common form of hemochromatosis is associated with mutations in the HFE, an atypical major histocompatibility class I molecule. Inactivation of the HJV (hemojuvelin), a BMP co-receptor, leads to early onset juvenile hemochromatosis, characterized by more severe iron overload. Both HFE and HJV operate as upstream regulators of iron signaling to hepcidin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Hemochromatosis patients exhibit excessive iron accumulation within hepatocytes, which predisposes them to liver fibrosis and progression to end stage liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref011">11</xref>]. Hfe-/- and Hjv-/- mice recapitulate the relatively milder or severe iron overload of patients with adult or juvenile hemochromatosis, respectively, but do not develop spontaneous early liver disease. Interestingly, Hfe-/- mice manifested a NASH-like phenotype and early liver fibrosis after feeding a high fat diet for 8 weeks, which was only partially attributed to iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref012">12</xref>]. On the other hand, a 12-week high fat diet intake caused liver steatosis but did not promote steatohepatitis or liver fibrosis in Hjv-/- mice, in spite of severe hepatocellular iron overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref013">13</xref>]. These data raised the possibility for a protective function of Hfe against metabolic liver disease. Herein, we explored this hypothesis by comparing pathophysiological responses of mice with single or combined Hfe/Hjv deficiency to high fat diet.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Hfe-/- and Hjv-/- mice were provided by Dr. Nancy Andrews (Duke University) and were backcrossed for 10 generations to the C57BL/6J genetic background. Double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- mice were obtained by intercrossing single Hfe-/- and Hjv-/- animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref014">14</xref>]; the breeding also yielded wild type C57BL/6J mice, which were used as control. Four-week old male animals (n = 10 for each genotype) were fed after weaning for 14 weeks with a standard diet containing 200 ppm iron (Harlad Teklad 2018), or high fat diets containing either 50 or 200 ppm iron (Harlad Teklad TD.88137 or TD.180571, respectively). The exact composition of the Harlad Teklad 2018 and TD.88137 diets can be found in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.envigo.com/resources/data-sheets/2018-datasheet-0915.pdf" ns0:type="simple">https://www.envigo.com/resources/data-sheets/2018-datasheet-0915.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.envigo.com/resources/data-sheets/88137.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.envigo.com/resources/data-sheets/88137.pdf</ext-link>, respectively. The TD.180571 diet was identical to TD.88137, except that it was supplemented with extra iron to match the 200 ppm iron content of the standard Harlad Teklad 2018 diet. A group of 10-week old male wild type mice were treated for 6 weeks with CCl<sub>4</sub> to develop liver fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref015">15</xref>]. All animals were on C57BL/6J genetic background. They were housed in a temperature-controlled environment (22 &#177; 1&#176; C, 60 &#177; 5% humidity), with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and were allowed <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to diets and drinking water. At the endpoint, the mice were sacrificed by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, followed by cardiac puncture to collect blood, and cervical dislocation. Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture and clotted at room temperature for 1 h. Serum was separated by centrifugation (2000 g for 10 min), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#176;C for biochemical analysis. Livers were rapidly excised and tissue sections were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#176;C for biochemical studies. Other liver sections were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological and ultrastructural studies. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of McGill University (protocol 4966).</p>

<title>Responses of mouse models of hemochromatosis to high fat diets</title>
<p>Hfe-/- mice represent a model of the most common and relatively milder form of hemochromatosis, while Hjv-/- and double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- mice develop more severe iron overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref014">14</xref>]. Thus, when compared to isogenic wild type control animals, serum iron and transferrin saturation were modestly elevated in Hfe-/- and substantially augmented in Hjv-/- and double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- mice on a standard diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). TIBC appeared slightly reduced in all hemochromatosis models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Feeding a high fat diet (HFD) containing 50 ppm iron immediately after weaning for 14 weeks resulted an approximately 35% body weight gain in all mice irrespective of genotype, as compared to age- and sex-matched controls fed a standard diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). A similar weight gain was also noted in all mice fed the HFD supplemented with extra iron to match the 200 ppm iron content of the standard diet; nevertheless, the actual weights were not registered. HFD intake (with either 50 or 200 ppm iron) was associated with slight increases in serum iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and TIBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), and commensurate drops in transferrin saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of high fat diets (HFDs) on serum iron parameters and body weight in mouse models of hemochromatosis.</title>
<p>Wild type control (wt), Hfe-/-, Hjv-/- and double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- mice (n = 10 per group, all males in C57BL/6 genetic background) were placed immediately after weaning on a standard diet containing 200 ppm iron, or on HFDs containing either 50 or 200 ppm iron. After 14 weeks, body weights were monitored, the animals were sacrificed, and sera and liver tissues were obtained for analysis. (A) serum iron; (B) transferrin saturation; (C) total iron binding capacity (TIBC); and (D) body weights of the mice. All data are presented as the mean &#177; SEM.

<p>In addition, HFD intake promoted an increase in levels of serum glucose, cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, but not triglycerides, in all genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g002">Fig 2A&#8211;2D</xref>). The effects on cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol appeared less pronounced in Hfe-/- mice on HFD with 50 ppm iron. We also analyzed serum transaminases ALT and AST. Thus, the HFD with 200 ppm iron triggered a profound (&gt;10-fold) increase in ALT, and a relatively more modest (~50&#8211;75%) increase in AST levels in all genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>).</p>

<p>Livers of all mice on HFD (with either 50 or 200 ppm iron) were enlarged and exhibited mixed micro- and macrovesicular steatosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g003">Fig 3</xref>). There were no differences among genotypes in the degree and the pattern of fat deposition. Histological analysis did not reveal any large inflammatory foci or clusters of immune cells in any of the examined livers. The above data suggest that the HFDs promote similar obesity and liver steatosis in wild type mice and mouse models of hemochromatosis, irrespectively of their iron content.</p>

<title>Does hepatic iron overload trigger progression of steatosis to liver fibrosis?</title>
<p>As expected, mouse models of hemochromatosis developed hepatic iron overload (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This was relatively mild in Hfe-/- mice and more intense in Hjv-/- and double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- counterparts, in agreement with earlier data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref014">14</xref>]. Liver iron accumulation was generally reduced in animals fed the HFDs, as previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref018">18</xref>], but Hfe-/- mice did not follow this trend. The decreases in liver iron content were more pronounced in Hjv-/- and double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- mice on the HFD containing 50 ppm iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Staining of liver sections with Perls&#8217; Prussian blue revealed the presence of iron deposits in hepatocytes of hemochromatotic but not wild type control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The signal was diluted in liver sections from animals fed the HFDs, and its intensity was proportional to the iron content of the HFD.</p>

<p>Hepatocellular iron overload was not associated with liver fibrosis in any of the mice fed standard diet or HFDs, independently of iron content. The presence of collagen was assessed histologically by Masson&#8217;s trichrome staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), and biochemically by the hydroxyproline assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Liver samples from CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated wild type mice served as positive control for liver fibrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression of &#945;-SMA, a marker of activated hepatic stellate cells, in livers of Hjv-/-, Hfe-/-Hjv-/- and to a smaller extent also Hfe-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In addition, HFD intake (50 ppm iron) promoted &#945;-SMA expression in livers of wild type mice. Thus, either hepatic iron overload or steatosis appear to activate fibrogenic responses in mouse models of hemochromatosis; however, their combination does not dramatically accelerate them to promote rapid progression of liver disease.</p>

<title>Ultrastructural studies</title>
<p>Analysis of the liver tissue by TEM corroborated the absence of inflammation or fibrosis in hemochromatotic and steatotic mice. Data obtained from animals on standard diet are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g007">Fig 7</xref> (top). Wild type hepatocytes exhibited a normal architecture and contained regular lipid droplets and glycogen granules. On the other hand, some mitochondria displayed darker contrast suggesting the possible presence of lipids stained by osmium tetroxide. The same feature was observed in Hfe-/- hepatocytes, but some mitochondria were swollen (arrow). Hjv-/- hepatocytes displayed well-preserved mitochondria with much less dense glycogen and reduced lipid droplets. ER appears to be less organized and located more around mitochondria. Interestingly, in Hfe-/-Hjv-/- hepatocytes the reduced lipid content persisted but glycogen density and mitochondrial appearance were normalized.</p>

<p>Data from mice on HFD (50 ppm iron) are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g007">Fig 7</xref> (bottom). The number and size of lipid droplets was increased in all genotypes. Nevertheless, the number of fat vesicles was relatively higher in Hfe-/-, and the overall fat content lower in Hjv-/- hepatocytes. The appearance of mitochondria was improved in Hfe-/- hepatocytes but the glycogen density was reduced compared to that from mice on standard diet. By contrast, some mitochondria looked abnormal in Hjv-/- hepatocytes (arrows), the glycogen density remained low, and the ER got disorganized in response to the HFD. With respect to mitochondria and ER, hepatocytes from Hfe-/-Hjv-/- and Hfe-/- mice on HFD had a similar phenotype. Glycogen density appears reduced. Taken together, the transmission electron microscopy data reveal distinct ultrastructural features among mouse models of hemochromatosis and raise the possibility for metabolic functions of Hfe and Hjv.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Excessive accumulation of iron or fat in hepatocytes are known pathogenic factors for liver injury. Clinical data suggested a synergism of hepatocellular iron overload and steatosis in liver disease progression to liver fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref019">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref021">21</xref>]. We sought to validate these findings using Hjv-/- mice, a model of severe, early onset juvenile hemochromatosis. However, feeding Hjv-/- mice with a HFD did not cause progression of liver steatosis to steatohepatitis or fibrosis, in spite of profound iron overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref013">13</xref>]. In another study, intake of a HFD triggered early liver fibrosis in Hfe-/- mice, a model of relatively mild, late onset adult hemochromatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref012">12</xref>]. Hfe-/- mice also manifested exacerbated hepatotoxicity following combined HFD and alcohol intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on these findings, we reasoned that Hfe may exert a potential iron-independent function in liver disease progression and utilized herein double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- mice to explore this hypothesis. Hfe-/-Hjv-/- and Hjv-/- mice exhibit an indistinguishable iron overload phenotype, suggesting that the <italic>Hjv</italic> gene is epistatic to <italic>Hfe</italic> in iron homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref014">14</xref>]. Thus, comparing the responses of these animals to a HFD would provide insights on the role of Hfe in metabolic liver disease. To this end, isogenic sex and age-matched wild type control, Hfe-/-, Hjv-/- and double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- mice were exposed for 14 weeks to HFDs only differing in iron content. HFD intake triggered obesity and liver steatosis in all genotypes but did not promote steatohepatitis or liver fibrosis in any of them (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g005">5</xref>), independently of iron content. These data do not support an iron-independent protective role of Hfe against liver disease progression.</p>
<p>The Hfe-/- mice used in this work and in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref012">12</xref>] shared the same genetic background (C57BL/6J). In our experiments, exposure to the HFD started a bit earlier (immediately after weaning vs at the 6th week of age) and lasted considerably longer (14 vs 8 weeks); this setting is expected to be more favorable to liver injury. Thus, we speculate that the discordant results reported herein and in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref012">12</xref>] may be related to a genetic drift in mouse colonies or to small variations in the HFD content. It will be interesting to examine responses of Hfe-/-Hjv-/- and Hjv-/- mice to the HFD used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The data with Hjv-/- mice are largely consistent with our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref013">13</xref>]. However, we did not observe reduced body weight gain of Hjv-/- compared to wild type mice in response to HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), contrary to data in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref013">13</xref>]. Presumably, this discrepancy is related to the different timing the mice were placed on HFD (immediately after weaning vs at the 10<sup>th</sup> week of age) and the duration of HFD feeding (14 vs 12 weeks).</p>
<p>Our data suggest that hepatocellular iron overload does not aggravate liver steatosis to steatohepatitis or fibrosis in the mouse models of hemochromatosis, at least within the time frame of 14 weeks. Nevertheless, it contributes to liver injury, as reflected in the increased serum ALT and AST values of mice fed the HFD containing 200 ppm iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). It is conceivable that iron&#8217;s hepatotoxicity is manifested histologically at later time points. It should be noted that either iron or fat accumulation trigger fibrogenic responses on their own right, as illustrated by the induction of &#945;-SMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g006">Fig 6</xref>), a marker of hepatic stellate cell activation to collagen-secreting myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref023">23</xref>]. However, their combination does not appear to aggravate or accelerate these responses in mice.</p>
<p>Notably, HFD intake appeared to mitigate hepatic iron overload (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g004">Fig 4</xref>), presumably due to reduced iron absorption, and in agreement with earlier data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref018">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, HFD-fed hemochromatotic mice of our study had pathological hepatic iron content, which was proportional to the iron content of the diet and was visible by Perls staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Considering the ~40% increased size of the steatotic livers, the quantitative ferrozine assay as expressed in &#956;g of iron per gram of dry liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) probably underestimates the true hepatocellular iron concentration. In any case, the increased hepatic iron content that was achieved in animals fed the iron-supplemented HFD did not enhance liver pathology. Along these lines, we previously reported that Hjv-/- mice were resistant to liver fibrosis even after feeding a HFD containing 2% carbonyl iron; under these conditions, the excessive iron content of the HFD resulted in reduced steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Assuming that even a low degree of hepatocellular iron overload is often pathogenic in humans, our results do not recapitulate clinical data on NAFLD in hemochromatosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref019">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref021">21</xref>]. This notion underlines known shortcomings of mouse models. Thus, contrary to hemochromatosis patients, genetic mouse models of hemochromatosis are spared from spontaneous liver injury due to hepatocellular overload, unless they are subjected to chronic (1 year) feeding with high iron diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref025">25</xref>]. On the other hand, dietary iron overload was shown to promote steatohepatitis in genetically obese Lepr<sup>db/db</sup> mice; notably excess iron accumulated predominantly in reticuloendothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref026">26</xref>]. This result is in line with clinical studies establishing a pathogenic role of reticuloendothelial iron overload, which has been documented in many NAFLD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref027">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>On a final note, the TEM analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221455.g007">Fig 7</xref> uncovers marked differences in hepatocyte ultrastructure of Hfe-/- and Hjv-/- mice. It identified apparent mitochondrial abnormalities in Hfe-/- hepatocytes, and confirmed the previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221455.ref013">13</xref>] reduction in fat and glycogen stores in Hjv-/- hepatocytes. Strikingly, glycogen density and mitochondrial morphology were corrected in Hfe-/-Hjv-/- hepatocytes. These findings are consistent with metabolic functions of Hfe and Hjv, most likely unrelated to their iron regulatory activities. Future experiments, for instance by using high-throughput -omics technologies, could shed more light on relevant biochemical mechanisms and pathophysiological implications.</p>

<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This is the revised manusctipt by changing the experimental condition, notaby that iron content in high fat diet was standerized. Accordingly, the results in three groups were comparable. The discussion was carefully presented to avoid overspeculation.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Summary: This study addresses the effect of a high fat diet given to three different mouse models of hereditary hemochromatosis on liver health. The findings, that iron overload does not straight forward correlate with liver damage in dietary induced liver steatosis are unexpected and intriguing. Further, the findings on modulated fat and glycogen content of hepatocytes of Hfe or Hjv KO mice, and a possible connection to mitochondrial morphology will lead to further interesting research.</p>
<p>Figures 1 and 2 are in very low quality and the letters indicating statistical significance are hard to see. Also, in the figure legends, where it says:&#8221; Statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05) across genotypes (versus columns a, b, a&#8217;, b&#8217;, c&#8217;, a&#8217;&#8217;) are indicated by a, b, a&#8217;, b&#8217;, c&#8217;, a&#8217;&#8217; and across diets by #&#8221; it is not clear, what the # exactly stands for. For example, the # on column c&#8217; in figure 1A. Does it mean that this column is statistically different from column c or c&#8221; or both?</p>
<p>Actually, all figures are in such low quality, that I cannot assess them well. From a superficial view, it seems that the conclusions are supported by the presented data. Possibly, some quantitative image analysis, especially on the activated stellate cells could give additional strength to the presented interpretations.</p>
