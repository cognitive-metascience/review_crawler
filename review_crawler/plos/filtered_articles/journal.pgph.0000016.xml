            <abstract>
                <p>Health literacy is one of the most critical aspects of health promotion. Limited health literacy is also accounted for adverse health outcomes and a huge financial burden on society. However, a gap exists in the level of health literacy, especially among undergraduates. This study aimed to assess the levels of health literacy and its socio-demographic determinants among undergraduate students of Tribhuvan University, Nepal. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 469 undergraduate students from five institutes of Tribhuvan University, Nepal. The 16-item short version of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q16) was used to measure students’ health literacy levels. Associated factors were examined using Chi-square tests followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses at the level of significance of 0.05. Nearly 61% of students were found to have limited health literacy (24.5% had “inadequate” and 36.3% had “problematic” health literacy). Female students (aOR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1–2.5), students from non-health related majors (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2–3.0), students with unsatisfactory health status (aOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.7–4.5), students with poor financial status (aOR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.2–6.8) and students with low self-esteem (aOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.5–4.1) were significantly more likely to have limited health literacy. The majority of the undergraduates were found to have limited health literacy. Gender, sector of study, self-rated health status, self-rated financial status, and self-esteem were significantly associated with limited health literacy. This study indicates university students should not be assumed to be health-literate and interventions to improve students’ health literacy especially for those whose majors are not health-related should be implemented. Further studies using a longer version of the health literacy survey questionnaire and qualitative methods to explore more on determinants of health literacy are recommended.</p>

            <p>Health literacy represents the cognitive and social skills that determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand, and use information in ways that promote and maintain good health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref001">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has positioned health literacy as a key mechanism to meet the health-related Sustainable Development Goal (SDG3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref002">2</xref>]. It has recently been shown to be important for improving Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Improving UHC must not only focus on providing infrastructure but also equipping people to be able to explore, understand, and use existing channels to enhance their health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref003">3</xref>]. However, there is little known about the status of health literacy in developing countries such as Nepal.</p>
            <p>People sometimes have difficulties in seeking health care, understanding health information, difficulty communicating with health care professionals, adherence to medical regimens, etc. which have a potential role in self-care and management of chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref004">4</xref>]. Limited health literacy is associated with adverse health outcomes, health inequalities, and a huge financial burden on society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref005">5</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref006">6</xref>]. Health literacy has been shown as a stronger predictor of health status than any other socioeconomic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref007">7</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref008">8</xref>]. According to a recent meta-analysis, health literacy was moderately correlated with quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref009">9</xref>]. Therefore, improving the level of health literacy should be put forward as an essential action for promoting health.</p>
            <p>Nepal has a unique landscape of rich culture and traditional beliefs and practices which have implications for health and diseases. There are still many misconceptions and deep-rooted cultural beliefs about health, illness, and the healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref010">10</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref011">11</xref>]. It is relevant to measure health literacy coupled with these cultural factors as there are very few studies conducted to examine health literacy in Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref012">12</xref>].
            </p>
            <p>The undergraduate stage is regarded as a stage with the greatest learning potential and this stage is critical for forming the framework of health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref008">8</xref>]. For many students, the university is a period of transition from teenager to young adult, moving out of home and relying less on parents to make health-related decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref013">13</xref>]. Understanding the health literacy levels of these younger populations and then addressing any gaps provides a mechanism towards producing health literate professionals who can understand and respond to the health literacy needs of the families and communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref014">14</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref015">15</xref>]. This population constitutes a major proportion and is crucial for the success of any health related promotion or prevention efforts. They are very receptive to information, and therefore, healthy behavior established at this phase of life is more likely to be continued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref016">16</xref>].
            </p>
            <p>University students may reasonably be expected to demonstrate good levels of health literacy; however, various studies worldwide have demonstrated poor health literacy among undergraduates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref008">8</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref017">17</xref>]. So, it is essential to explore the level of health literacy among undergraduates. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the level of health literacy and factors determining limited health literacy among undergraduate students in Tribhuvan University, Nepal.</p>

                    <p>English version of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire with 16 items (HLS-EU-Q16) was used to assess health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref018">18</xref>,                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref019">19</xref>]. This measure focuses on perceived difficulties/ease in accessing, understanding, appraising, and applying health information across the domains of health care, disease prevention, and health promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref020">20</xref>].
                    </p>
                    <p>The 16 items have four responses (very easy, easy, difficult, and very difficult) with a “don’t know” option. All responses were given a numerical code as follows: 1, very difficult; 2, difficult; 3, easy; 4, very easy; and 0, don’t know. The mean score was calculated for all items on the scale, and then it was converted to an index using the formula below per recommendations of the European health literacy consortium.</p>
                    <p>
                        <italic>Health literacy index score = (mean—1) * (50/3)</italic>, where mean is the average of items on the scale, 1 = the minimal value of the mean, 3 = the range of the mean, and 50 = the chosen maximum value of the new index scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref018">18</xref>,                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref021">21</xref>].
                    </p>
                    <p>The index scores were recoded into four health literacy categories as per the threshold established by HLS-EU consortium: <italic>excellent (&gt;42–50); sufficient (&gt;33–42); problematic (&gt;25–33); and inadequate (0–25)</italic>. Later, health literacy categories were dichotomized into limited (inadequate and problematic health literacy categories combined) and adequate health literacy (sufficient and excellent health literacy categories combined). During the pretesting no one reported the difficulties in understanding the questionnaire and we decided to administer questionnaire in English version.</p>

The academic year of the students was categorized into “lower year” and “higher year’, where the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> year of the study was regarded as lower year and ≥3<sup>rd</sup> year as the higher year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref017">17</xref>,                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref023">23</xref>].

                    <p>Other variables were self-rated financial status, self-rated health status, and self-rated self-esteem. Self-rated financial status was measured on a scale of 1 to 6 which included the responses from very poor to very rich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref017">17</xref>], categorized as a new variable as: 1–2 (poor) and 3–6 (good). Self-rated health status was classified as excellent, good, moderate, poor, and very poor. This was re-categorized into satisfactory health and unsatisfactory health status. Responses “excellent” and “good health” were combined into satisfactory, while all other responses were categorized as unsatisfactory health status. Self-rated self-esteem was measured on a scale of 1 to 7 using the Rosenberg scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref024">24</xref>]. Measurement on the scale was based on response to the item “I have very high self-esteem” where the lowest value represents the “not very true of me” and the highest value “very true of me”.</p>

The mean age (± SD) of the respondents was 20.9 (± 1.7) years. Among the respondents, the majority were males (54.1%). Brahmin/Chhetri (75.7%) was the major ethnic group followed by Janajati (17.3%) and Madhesi (5.1%). While categorizing place of origin as rural and urban, the majority of respondents (60.6%) were from rural settlements. 71.9% of the participants belonged to a nuclear family.</p>
                <p>About 73.6% of the students were from non-health-related faculties while 26.4% were from the directly health-related faculties as the Institute of Medicine (IOM) is the only institute running health programs among five institutes of Tribhuvan University. Talking about the parent’s highest level of education, 62.3% of fathers had attained education of secondary level or above while only 35.2% mothers had attained that level of education.</p>

                <p>About 61% of the undergraduate students were found to have limited health literacy. Female students were 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1–2.5) times more likely to have limited health literacy as compared to males. Students whose majors were not directly related to health were almost twice more likely to have limited health literacy than students of health-related majors (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2–3.0). Students who perceived their health status as unsatisfactory had higher odds of limited health literacy compared to students who reported having satisfactory health status (aOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.7–4.5). Compared to students who have good financial status, students with low financial status were 2.9 times more likely to have limited health literacy (aOR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.2–6.8). Students having low self-esteem were more likely to have limited health literacy than those who have high self-esteem (aOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.5–4.1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgph.0000016.t003">Table 3</xref>).

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>The study found that 60.8% of the undergraduates studying at Tribhuvan University, Nepal, had limited health literacy. Our study finding was consistent with a Ghanaian university-based study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref017">17</xref>]. The population based health literacy survey conducted in eight European countries showed 47% had limited (insufficient or problematic) health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref021">21</xref>]. However university-based studies, especially in the United States and Canada, have reported better levels of health literacy (about 7%-15% limited health literacy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref025">25</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref026">26</xref>]. These huge differences might be due to difference in study settings as these countries are highly developed and richer than Nepal. Economic development levels, health resource allocations, and access to health information are lower in developing countries like Nepal compared to developed countries like the United States and Canada.</p>
            <p>In this study, females were found to be 1.6 times more likely to have limited health literacy than males. This contrasts with the findings from a similar study conducted among Danish adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref027">27</xref>] and university students in Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref028">28</xref>]. Patriarchal societies where households tend to favor males for healthcare services, variations in the educational systems and the other sociocultural characteristics may have attributed to this discrepancy.</p>
            <p>Higher odds of having limited health literacy were found on the students from non-health related majors as compared with students from health-related majors. Similar differences were seen in other studies conducted in countries like Ghana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref017">17</xref>], China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref008">8</xref>], Jordan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref023">23</xref>] and America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref025">25</xref>]. The possible explanation could be students in health-related programs familiarity with the health-related knowledge, the health-care environment, topics of health promotion, and disease prevention.</p>
            <p>Students from rural origin reported a lower level of health literacy than students from an urban origin in a study from China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref008">8</xref>]. However, in our study no significant association was found between health literacy and place of origin. It might be due to the difference in sampling size. Students who reported their health status as unsatisfactory were more likely to have a lower level of health literacy, consistent with existing literatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref029">29</xref>–                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref031">31</xref>]. This pattern is likely due to their difficulty in navigating the healthcare system and possessing insufficient health information for self-care.</p>
            <p>Individuals who perceived their financial status as poor had higher odds of having limited health literacy compared to their counterparts. This is consistent with the results of some studies conducted among university students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref007">7</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref017">17</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref027">27</xref>]. Lower economic status impacts the access, use, and quality of health care. This factor might have played a role in health literacy skills of students. In our study, students with high self-esteem levels had higher health literacy than their counterparts who rated themselves as having low self-esteem. Adolescents’ mental and physical health status were found to be associated self-esteem in a study conducted in New Zealand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref032">32</xref>]. This evidence might explain the role of self-esteem in determining the level of health literacy.</p>
            <p>Contrary to our expectation, health literacy was not associated with the academic year and parent’s highest level of education as reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref007">7</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref008">8</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref014">14</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref017">17</xref>,                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref033">33</xref>]. This absence of association is not well understood and needs to be explored prospectively in future research. In our study, the mean score per item (over all competencies) was lowest for appraising health information and while comparing all competencies over the three domains, the mean score per item was highest within the domain of health promotion. Therefore, our findings corroborate with findings from study conducted in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgph.0000016.ref027">27</xref>].

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to explore health literacy among university undergraduates and compare the health literacy levels among health and non health- related students in Nepal. The study provided information on student’s self-perceived competencies necessary for them to make informed health decisions. The findings of this study added evidence into the limited literature on the health literacy level in Nepal.</p>
                <p>The present study had few limitations. All the measurements in this study were based on self-reports, which may have been prone to response and information bias. This study was cross-sectional and, therefore, cannot demonstrate causality between the factors associated with health literacy. As most of the participants were from non-health background, which might have created the discrepancy while analyzing the health literacy level in terms of health-related students versus non-health related students. Restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic limited our plans for on-site data collection so we had to collect the data online. Since this was a web-based study, limited access to the internet may have discouraged the students from participating in the survey.</p>

            <title>Conclusion</title>
            <p>The study revealed a high prevalence of limited health literacy among university students in Nepal. Gender, sector of study, perceived health status, financial status and self-esteem were significantly associated with limited health literacy. According to the findings, even educated people, such as undergraduates, face difficulties interacting with health-care procedures and systems. University students should not be assumed to be health-literate and interventions that will help enhance their literacy in health should be implemented especially among non-health related institutions. Specific policy to make health literacy friendly health institutions must be implemented. Further studies with better sampling procedure using a longer version of health literacy survey questionnaire and qualitative methods to explore more on determinants of health literacy are recommended.</p>

Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
            <p>Both authors reflect on the need of improving the methods section. More information is thus needed to understand various proceeding associated with the online survey. As editor my main concern is also methodological. Authors should let the readers know about the population (averages of age, female proportion, parents’ education etc.) from which the study sample is drawn from. Otherwise the study may not show if sample biases have been corrected at all. The sample can be representative of maybe one or two students’ characteristics, and this should be communicated and adjusted when discussing results.                <!-- </div> --></p>

Method is well written and explained the tools adequately. But a brief description of the web-based survey tool, the language in which it was delivered would be welcome. Did all the tools [health literacy scale, financial, self-esteem and health status ] were put in the online survey tool, and whether it was delivered in English or Nepali Language may help the readers to understand the data collection process. A line or two on the consent process should be considered.                <!-- </span> --></p>

            <p>Reviewer 2</p>
            <p>The manuscript submitted by Mr. Pranil Man Singh Pradhan and his team is important and has tried to fill the gap of literature in the area of health literacy. I enjoyed reading this work, and I have found some minor comments as well. Which I hope, the author would include into his work. I have embedded my comments by specifying each section of the manuscript.</p>
            <p>Topic</p>
            <p>1. Authors could make the topic more specific. Since, this study has been done in only one university of Nepal, it would not be fair to say the study among the university students. The current topic gives an idea to the readers that a study is among the university students in Nepal which, in fact, is not.</p>
            <p>Abstract</p>
            <p>1. The author has used HLS-EC-Q16 as a key word, but I did not find this abbreviation used anywhere in the abstract. I would suggest using the abbreviation first, at least once, and than use it in the keyword section.</p>
            <p>Introduction</p>
            <p>1. Not enough literature review has been done. How can limited health literacy leads to the economical burden and health inequalities in the society, you need to support this argument with evidence since you have mentioned this twice (in the abstract and second paragraph of an introduction).</p>
            <p>2. The question like why this study was done in Nepal or how this study is relevant to Nepalese context is crucial. What are those believes, practices and mis-conception prevalent is Nepalese society which are preventing people to get informed about health information or have implication on health and disease in Nepal. Why was it so important to conduct this study in Nepal? Why you choose undergraduate student in Nepal? How this group (undergraduate) is so important in the Nepalese context that compel you to conduct this study? For example, did you choose this study group because this group represents the larger fraction of Nepalese population or because this group can influence the larger percentage of Nepalese population or because of something else? You need to work more on this. By only saying that undergraduate is a transition period, and it is always misunderstood as an educated group is enough to conduct this study. I think, enough studies need to be examined to answer these questions. The relation between three: Health Literacy, Nepal and Undergraduate students should be strong to carry out this study. This convinces others as well to make another study, expand this work and to contribute more to the area. When your rational to conduct a study in any region is strong, being an international reader  who do not know about Nepal, could understand your work more clarity and easily correlate the situation. It also makes an international reader to read a paper with the eyes of clarity.</p>
            <p>3. In the 4th paragraph, the author has aimed to assess the level of comprehensive health literacy through this study. What does the word “comprehensive” means here? Does this questionnaire claim to measure the level of comprehensive health literacy? If yes, please state the word comprehensive with the evidence from claim.</p>
            <p>Methodology:</p>
            <p>1. I think, the author has not explained the inclusion and exclusion criteria very well which have created a confusion of understanding. The authors say that all undergraduates’ students are included. But I guess there must be international students in IoM, IoE or other institute pursuing their undergraduate degree. What about them? Did you include them or not? If yes, do they represent Nepal? Please make this clear.</p>
            <p>2. The author has excluded the postgraduates’ students and affiliated programs. But what about the constituent campuses in IoM. There are 7 constituents’ campuses and 1 central department of public health under the IoM. Did you include the students from those constituents’ campuses? Are there any other constituent campuses under other institutes like the Institute of Medicine have? You should mention these thoughts very clearly. So that the readers should not have any confusion.</p>
            <p>Tribhuvan university: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/institute/1_5db00959912d0#" xlink:type="simple">http://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/institute/1_5db00959912d0#</ext-link>
            </p>
            <p>3. The author has collected the sample from each institute proportionally based on the size of the population of each institute. So, what is the number of population/students enrolled in each institute in the corresponding year? How do I check whether they have collected the responses proportionally or not? How do I validate your sample taken from each institute? You must include the total number of students enrolled in each institute in the year in which study was pursued.</p>
            <p>4. Did you translate the questionnaire into your local Nepalese language? If yes, how did you do that? Is the questionnaire tested before in the local language or the translated questionnaire have been piloted before? If you did not translate the questionnaire, did you receive any difficulties from the participants about the understanding of the words used in the questionnaire? Please make this very clear. This is important in many senses. One would be, it may give an idea to other researchers who wants to replicate or expand your work in the future by using the same questionnaire in Nepal.</p>
            <p>5. The author has used a scale of 1 to 6 to measure self-rated financial status. Could you please clarify how did you build this scale? Is this an international standard? Is there any formula to develop this scale?</p>
            <p>6. The author says limited access to the internet may have discouraged the students from participating in the survey. Does any student refused/denied participating in this survey due to internet problem or any other problem? If yes, what was the reason of denial. Was it internet or any cultural believes or any other reason? You should provide information regarding the refusal of participants if there was any.</p>
            <p>7. Why did the author used shorter version of HLS-EC questionnaire? Why not the longer version of this questionnaire (HLS-EC Q16 vs Q47)?)? Please explain this. This may help you to identify strength or weakness of this study.</p>
            <p>Results</p>
            <p>1. The author in the Table 3 has categorized an academic year into Higher year and Lower year. What does higher and lower year mean? How did you classify this? Which year of students are included in higher and which groups are kept in lower year? Please state this.</p>
            <p>2. Be careful about the correctness while writing the numbers and decimals. For example, you have used two values of mean (SD): 2.86 and 2.74 for disease prevention domain. Which one is correct? Please check the overall manuscript for such minor errors to convey the right idea.</p>
            <p>Discussion and conclusion (Strengths and limitations)</p>
            <p>1. There is huge difference in the sample size between health and non-health related students (26% vs 74%). Based on this sample difference, how can you say that the health-related students demonstrate higher level of health literacy? What if that was because of lower sample size of health-related students?</p>
