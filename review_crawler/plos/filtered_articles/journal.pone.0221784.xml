<sec id="sec003">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed in 1010 DMD-treated MS patients at least 10 years from onset.

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Results</title>
<p>After a mean disease duration of 19.6 (SD = 7.7) years, low cognitive performance was observed in 23.7% (N = 239), moderate performance in 42.7% (N = 431), and 33.7% (N = 340) had high cognitive performance, meeting the definition of cognitively resilient patients. Within the group of patients with low cognitive performance, severe disability was observed in 50.6% (121/239), while in the group of patients with high cognitive performance, mild disability was observed in 64.4% (219/340). Differences between the group of patients with high cognitive performance and severe disability (4.5%) and the group of patients with low cognitive performance and mild disability (5.0%) were not accounted for by DMD treatment duration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cognitive impairment has been reported to occur in 40&#8211;65% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and can present even in early phases of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref001">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref004">4</xref>]. We have previously reported the profile of cognitive decline in a large cohort of 1500 MS patients showing that cognitive performance was below the normative average for cognitively intact individuals of similar age and education, with information processing speed and executive function most frequently impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref005">5</xref>]. Cognitive impairment was significant only at disease duration greater than five years suggesting the existence of an early therapeutic window [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref005">5</xref>]. However, the effects of disease modifying drugs (DMD) on cognitive impairments in MS have not been thoroughly studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref006">6</xref>], though several DMD have demonstrated a beneficial effect on cognitive performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref007">7</xref>] and spared brain atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref008">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref010">10</xref>], thus showing the potential to decrease cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Progression of cognitive decline in MS over time is variable, and it is not yet clear why some patients are cognitively resilient, while others decline within a short period of time. Prevalence of cognitive resilience in MS may explain variability across patients in profile of cognitive decline, and such resilience may signify a less active or even benign disease, and/or improved ability to recover during the active disease process.</p>
<p>In the current study, we characterized cognitive performance in DMD treated MS patients with disease duration longer than 10 years. We computed prevalence of patients with high, moderate and low cognitive performance and evaluated the relationship between cognitive status and neurological disability.</p>

<title>Study design and participants</title>
<p>This was a retrospective analysis of cross-sectional data obtained from RRMS and SPMS patients treated and followed at the Multiple Sclerosis Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. Demographic, clinical and cognitive data were extracted from the Sheba MS Center computerized database. The following criteria were applied to extract data for the current analyses: Inclusion criteria: (1) diagnosis of definite MS according to the revised McDonald criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref011">11</xref>]; (2) cognitive assessment after at least 10 years from disease onset; (3) neurological examination with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref012">12</xref>] within 3 months of the cognitive assessment; (4) treatment with DMD for at least 6 moths. Exclusion criteria: (1) primary progressive disease course; (2) corticosteroid treatment up to 3 months prior to the cognitive assessment; (3) known psychiatric illnesses (including major depression or anxiety) or dementia; (4) alcohol or drug abuse; (5) severe impairment of the upper limbs and/or visual impairment precluding performance of the computerized cognitive assessment. This was determined as a part of the cognitive test. Patients with severe upper limb dysfunction like paralysis or tremor that were not able to hold the computer-mouse were technically excluded from preforming the test. Similarly, at the beginning of the cognitive test visual acuity is assessed and patients that could not read the instructions were technically excluded from performing the test.</p>
<p>Each patient record was coded anonymously to ensure confidentiality during statistical analyses. For patients with multiple cognitive assessments, an automated algorithm randomly selected data from one visit so that each patient is represented only once in the study dataset. The study was approved by the Sheba Medical Center IRB Ethics Committee.</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Cognitive assessment</title>
<p>Cognitive performance was assessed with a battery of computerized tests (NeuroTrax Corporation, Medina, NY, USA). The NeuroTrax cognitive battery has been previously validated in MS patients showing good discriminant and construct validity as compared to conventional cognitive assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref013">13</xref>], and incorporates alternate forms that minimize learning on follow&#8208;ups. The battery is easily administered, and testing included the following cognitive domains: memory (verbal and nonverbal), executive function, attention, information processing speed, visual spatial processing, verbal function and motor skills. Each cognitive score was standardized relative to age-/education-stratified cognitively intact norms and scaled to an IQ-style scale (mean: 100, SD: 15). Domain scores were computed as the average scores from particular tests (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref005">5</xref>] for more details). A global cognitive score (GCS) was computed as the average of the cognitive domains scores. Testing time was approximately 45 min. The computerized cognitive battery has shown good test-retest reliability and construct validity relative to paper-based tests, including the frequently used Neuropsychological Screening Battery for MS, NSBMS, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref003">3</xref>], as well as sensitivity to effects of DMD in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Group categorization</title>
<p>Cognitive performance was categorized by GCS as &#8220;high&#8221; (GCS &gt;100), &#8220;moderate&#8221; (GCS 85&#8211;100) or &#8220;low&#8221; (GCS&lt;85). Neurological disability was classified according to EDSS score as &#8220;mild&#8221; (EDSS &#8804;3), "moderate&#8221; (EDSS 3.5&#8211;5.5), or "severe" (EDSS &#8805;6.0).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic, clinical and cognitive variables. Between groups differences were evaluated by the chi-square test for categorial variables and by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/continuous-variable/" ns0:type="simple">continuous variable</ext-link>s. Analyses were carried out using SPSS Version 25.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Two-tailed statistics were used, and significance level was set to p&lt;0.05.</p>

After a mean disease duration of 19.6 (SD = 7.7) years, low cognitive performance was found in 23.7% (N = 239) of patients, moderate performance in 42.7% (N = 431), and 33.7% (N = 340) had high cognitive performance attaining scores above average for cognitively intact individuals of similar age and education. Generally, lesser cognitive impairment was associated with lesser disability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221784.g001">Fig 1</xref>). As expected, significant differences between the low, moderate and high cognitive groups were found for all cognitive measures. Neurological disability by EDSS score and the functional system disability scores (except for visual functional score) were significantly higher in the groups with low and moderate cognitive performance as compared to patients with high cognitive performance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study assessed the frequency of cognitive impairment in a large cohort of DMD- treated RRMS and SPMS patients after nearly 20 years of illness. Notably, we observed a much lower rate of cognitive impairment than previously reported in the literature. Most studies assessing cognitive performance in MS estimated frequency of cognitive decline, particularly in the domains of attention, processing speed and working memory, to be within the range of 40% to 60% over the lifespan, but these studies were performed mainly in patients who did not receive DMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref014">14</xref>]. It is not surprising that cognitive impairment would be less than in the pre-DMD treatment era, due to effective disease modification and greater ascertainment of milder cases of MS.</p>
<p>The use of DMD significantly changed the pattern of MS progression. These medications modulate the inflammatory immune response and lead to decreased disease activity by reducing relapse rate and delaying disability progression. Consequently, these treatments lead to better cognitive protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref015">15</xref>]. The safety-risk profile of DMD in MS is favorable. Possible side effects vary between treatments and include injection-site reactions, increased risk for infections, gastrointestinal symptoms, flushing, autoimmune thyroid disorders and elevated liver enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>In our cohort of patients treated with DMD for a relatively long period, only 23.7% had low cognitive performance, while 33.7% had high cognitive performance attaining scores above average for cognitively intact individuals of similar age and education. This group of patients, that after a long disease duration of almost 20 years, maintained their cognitive skills, can be defined as &#8216;cognitively resilient&#8217; patients. The term resilience is derived from the Latin words salire (to leap or jump), and resilire (to spring back). When applied to cognition it denotes the capacity of the brain to resist deteriorating processes or injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref018">18</xref>]. Cognitive resilience literature has focused on specific contexts in which individuals differ in their capabilities to withstand or overcome brain insults and to explain the difference in the patterns of cognitive decline associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref019">19</xref>]. Various predisposing interacting factors may contribute to the road map for brain resilience, including education, gender, prior brain injuries, family history, participation in cognitively stimulating activities, physical exercise, social relationships and apoE genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref020">20</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref024">24</xref>]. In young patients with a chronic long-lasting disease like MS, characterizing differences between cognitive subgroups in relation to clinical variables may afford new insights into active neuroplasticity mechanisms and thus suggest plasticity facilitating treatments to enhance cognitive resilience. Our findings suggest a reason for optimism relative to the previously reported studies. Furthermore, we found that approximately 75% of RRMS and SPMS patients (i.e., &#8220;moderate&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221; cognitive performance groups combined) do not have low levels of cognitive function that may compromise quality of life, social interactions, employment prospects and work performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>It is of note that different DMD may have varying effects on cognitive performance, that during the long-term study period, patients switched DMD, and that treatment duration under each DMD varied; however, in spite of these limitations that make it difficult to assess the contribution of each DMD to cognitive performance, our findings are encouraging in suggesting that overall, long-term treatment with DMD affords significant beneficial effects in the maintenance of normal brain function.</p>
<p>As anticipated, increased neurological disability correlated with lower cognitive performance, indicating that cognitive function is an integral clinical feature of MS and directly related to neurological disability. Neurological disability by the EDSS score and functional system disability scores were significantly higher in the groups with low and moderate cognitive performance as compared to patients with high cognitive performance. No difference was found for visual functional score between the groups, probably because visual impairment was an exclusion criterion. However, no significant differences between high, moderate and low cognitive performance groups were observed for age and DMD treatment duration, suggesting that differences in cognitive performance may be attributable to differential disease activity. More aggressive disease activity characterized by increased rate of relapses and post-relapse residual disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref026">26</xref>] may lead to worse cognitive performance and higher disability despite treatment with DMD; this more aggressive group comprised 12.0% of the cohort. In contrast, 21.7% of the patients had high cognitive performance and low level of disability and can therefore be considered to have benign MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref028">28</xref>]. Cognitive resilience in these patients probably signifies MS resilience, e.g., resilience to the disease pathogenic mechanisms. These patients have low disability and therefore also manifest with less cognitive impairment, suggesting that cognition as a part of the functional neurological spectrum of MS, is better preserved in patients with less active disease. Indeed, it is expected that patients with a benign disease course, probably presenting as good responders to DMD treatment, will be resilient to disability and cognitive decline even after many years of disease.</p>
<p>More intriguing is to understand the groups for which cognitive performance and disability were inconsistent, i.e., patients who after a long-term follow-up present with high cognitive performance and severe disability (4.5%), or patients with low cognitive performance and mild disability (5.0%). We believe that these minority groups may have a different anatomical pattern of central nervous system involvement. Patients with cognitive resilience but severe disability probably have more pronounced spinal cord involvement, either cervical, thoracic or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref029">29</xref>], while patients with low cognitive performance and mild disability likely will have more distinct brain atrophy and a higher brain lesion load, with lesser cervical or thoracic spinal cord involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>In our cohort, 33.7% of patients were cognitively resilient. These patients had intact cognitive performance despite an extended disease duration, and the majority were also neurologically protected, reflected by a relatively low EDSS score. One of the mechanisms that accounts for cognitive resilience may be preserved brain functional reserve. In accordance, Rocca et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref032">32</xref>] reported that relatively mild grey matter damage was associated with a favorable clinical course in patients with benign MS. Sumowski et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221784.ref033">33</xref>] have suggested that the level of cerebral efficiency prior to disease affords a &#8216;cognitive reserve&#8217; against disease-related cognitive impairment, such that when cognitive processing is challenged by a brain disease, individuals with greater cerebral efficiency are better able to withstand the insult and will not develop cognitive impairment. Indeed, in our cohort, educational level was higher in patients with high cognitive performance as compared to patients with moderate and low cognitive performance.</p>
<p>Although our study is retrospective and cross-sectional and included only relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive patients, it encompasses a large number of patients, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates &#8220;real-world&#8221; experience of DMD treatments on cognitive performance in MS patients. We could not evaluate the effects of individual DMD on cognitive performance as patients changed treatments, and the treatment period for each medication varied. However, the main strength of our study is in elucidating the relationship between cognitive performance and disability in MS patients after a long disease duration.</p>
<p>We suggest that pre-disease intellectual enrichment reflected by educational level contributes to better cognitive reserve and better cognitive resilience in MS patients. Furthermore, a cognitive sparing effect can be enhanced by DMD treatment leading to a high rate of MS patients without cognitive decline even after many years from onset.</p>

<p>Additional Editor Comments:</p>
<p>The manuscript reports on the cognitive performance in individuals with long history of MS treated with DMD in relation to disability and cognitive resilience.</p>
<p>Overall, there needs to be consistencies in terminologies throughout the manuscript. Low cognitive, moderate cognitive, and high cognitive performance or severe cognitive, moderate cognitive, and low cognitive impairments. Specifically, define cognitive resilience in light of the terminology you choose. These will facilitate better comprehension of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Abstract: Apart from the inconsistency in terminologies, this section is well-written.</p>
<p>Introduction: Short and succinct.</p>
<p>Methods: Reads well.</p>
<p>Results: Page 6, end of the first paragraph: As shown in Table 1, there was also no significant difference in visual functions. This fact needs to be included in the narrative as well.</p>
<p>Figure 1 is exactly the same information as in Table 2. Either one, plus the narrative should be sufficient.</p>
<p>Discussion: Page 7, end of the first paragraph: Can you discuss some of side effects of DMDs?</p>
<p>Page 9: beginning of the second paragraph: If this is a prospective study, how is it possible that data was collected prospectively?</p>

<p>Dear Editor</p>
<p>Enclosed please find our revised manuscript PONE-D-19-14839 entitled &#8220;Cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis: A Long-term look on the bright side&#8221;, which we submit after revision after we addressed the points raised during the review process as follows:</p>
<p>Comment 1. Overall, there needs to be consistencies in terminologies throughout the manuscript. Low cognitive, moderate cognitive, and high cognitive performance or severe cognitive, moderate cognitive, and low cognitive impairments. </p>
<p>Specifically, define cognitive resilience in light of the terminology you choose. These will facilitate better comprehension of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Response: As suggested, we have better defined the cognitive terminologies throughout the manuscript, using the terminology of low cognitive, moderate cognitive, and high cognitive performance.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we have defined cognitive resilience as patients with high cognitive performance after a long-disease duration.</p>
<p>Comment 2. Results: Page 6, end of the first paragraph: As shown in Table 1, there was also no significant difference in visual functions. This fact needs to be included in the narrative as well.</p>
<p>Response: We added to the narrative the fact that there was no significant difference in visual function, Results end of first paragraph.. </p>
<p>Comment 3. Figure 1 is exactly the same information as in Table 2. Either one, plus the narrative should be sufficient.</p>
<p>Response: We omitted Table 2 and added the data to the narrative. Accordingly we changed the order of the figures (Figure 1is now Figure 2, and Figure 2 is now Figure 1), and explained in the narrative the numbers of the inconsistency groups.</p>
<p>Comment 4. Discussion: Page 7, end of the first paragraph: Can you discuss some of side effects of DMDs?</p>
<p>Added to the Discussion. </p>
<p>Comment 5. Page 9: beginning of the second paragraph: If this is a prospective study, how is it possible that data was collected prospectively?</p>
<p>We mentioned that the study was retrospective cross-sectional, but the data was collected prospectively &#8211; as we wanted to highlight the point that patients were evaluated on an on-going basis prospectively. As it seems confusing we omitted the term prospectively. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>I hope you will find the revised version merit for publication in PlosOne.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the manuscript PONE-D-19-14839R1 &#8220;Cognitive function in multiple sclerosis: a long-term look on the bright side&#8221;. I was not involved in the first review round and will therefore critique the manuscript from a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>This retrospective study includes a large number (n = 1010) of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and secondary progressive MS. The main aim was to describe cognitive functioning in those patients who had received at least 10 years of disease modifying drug treatment and to correlate cognitive impairments with long term disability. The authors found that the majority of patients with MS did not have cognitive decline. The authors discuss the findings in light of cognitive resilience and long-term quality of life.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed reading the manuscript. The manuscript is topical, timely, and well-written and contributes to the body of knowledge. My major comments are:</p>
<p>1. The discussion around cognitive resilience could be strengthened. Devote at least a paragraph explaining what cognitive resilience is, how it can be captured, what predisposing factors contribute to cognitive resilience, and how that may impact disability and quality of life. Provide references.</p>
<p>2. The leap from good performance on cognitive tests to &#8220;cognitive resilience&#8221; needs better argumentation. The authors report that 33.7% are cognitive resilient because they score well on cognitive tests despite long disease duration. However, they also have mild disability. It is logical to assume that those with mild disability will also have less cognitive impairments. The 33.7% with good performance in cognitive tests reported here do well because they are generally less disabled; not necessarily because they show better cognitive resilience. You could also argue then that these individuals have better physical resilience, or respond better to disease modifying treatment. It would be more important to focus on the persons who show high cognitive performance despite moderate to severe disability, e.g., those individuals reported in Table 2.</p>
<p>I have few minor comments:</p>
<p>3. How were the three groups of cognitive performance and the three groups of neurological disability determined. Please provide references on the categorization of cognitive performance and neurological disability.</p>
<p>4. Please add in the limitations section that this study included only relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS.</p>
<p>5. Please elaborate on exclusion criterion 5. How was it determined from chart review whether a patient had severe upper limb or visual impairment?</p>
<p>6. On that note, visual performance did not differ between the three groups (Table 1), probably because visual impairment was an exclusion criterion. Please add this to the discussion.</p>

<p>Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>1. The discussion around cognitive resilience could be strengthened. Devote at least a paragraph explaining what cognitive resilience is, how it can be captured, what predisposing factors contribute to cognitive resilience, and how that may impact disability and quality of life. Provide references.</p>
<p>Response: We have added to the Discussion a paragraph explaining what cognitive resilience is, how it can be captured, what predisposing factors contribute to cognitive resilience, and how that may impact disability and quality of life. In accordance we have provide references as follows:</p>
<p>The term resilience was derived from the Latin words salire (to leap or jump), and resilire (to spring back). When applied to cognition it stands for the capacity of the brain to resist deteriorating processes or injuries (SternY. What is cognitive reserve? Theory and research applications of the reserve concept. J Int Neuropsychol Soc 2002; 8:448&#8211;460. McEwen BS. In pursuit of resilience: stress, epigenetics, and brain plasticity. Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2016;1373:56-64). Cognitive resilience literature has focused on specific contexts in which individuals differ in their capabilities to withstand or overcome brain insults and to explain the difference in the patterns of cognitive decline associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases (de Frias CM, Dixon RA, B&#228;ckman L. Use of memory compensation strategies is related to psychosocial and health indicators. J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci. 2003;58:12-22.). Various predisposing interacting factors may contribute to the road map for brain resilience including education, gender, prior brain injuries, family history, participation in cognitively stimulating activities, physical exercises, social relationships and apoE genotype. (Christensen H1, Hofer SM, Mackinnon AJ, Korten AE, Jorm AF, Henderson AS. Age is no kinder to the better educated: absence of an association investigated using latent growth techniques in a community sample. Psychol Med. 2001;31:15-28. Kirk-Sanchez NJ, McGough EL. Physical exercise and cognitive performance in the elderly: current perspectives. Clin Interv Aging. 2014;9:51-62. Hofer SM, Christensen H, Mackinnon AJ, Korten AE, Jorm AF, Henderson AS, Easteal S. Change in cognitive functioning associated with apoE genotype in a community sample of older adults. Psychol Aging. 2002;17:194-208. Wilson RS, Mendes De Leon CF, Barnes LL, Schneider JA, Bienias JL, Evans DA, Bennett DA. Participation in cognitively stimulating activities and risk of incident Alzheimer disease. JAMA. 2002;287:742-8. Seeman TE, Lusignolo TM, Albert M, Berkman L. Social relationships, social support, and patterns of cognitive aging in healthy, high-functioning older adults: MacArthur studies of successful aging. Health Psychol. 2001;20:243-55.). In young patients with a chronic long-lasting disease like MS, characterizing differences between cognitive subgroups in relation to clinical variables may afford new insights into the on-going neuroplasticity mechanisms and in accordance suggest plasticity&#8208;facilitating treatments to enhance cognitive resilience. </p>
<p>2. The leap from good performance on cognitive tests to &#8220;cognitive resilience&#8221; needs better argumentation. The authors report that 33.7% are cognitive resilient because they score well on cognitive tests despite long disease duration. However, they also have mild disability. It is logical to assume that those with mild disability will also have less cognitive impairments. The 33.7% with good performance in cognitive tests reported here do well because they are generally less disabled; not necessarily because they show better cognitive resilience. You could also argue then that these individuals have better physical resilience, or respond better to disease modifying treatment. It would be more important to focus on the persons who show high cognitive performance despite moderate to severe disability, e.g., those individuals reported in Table 2.</p>
<p>Response: As the Reviewer commented, indeed, cognitive resilience in patients with long disease duration and mild disability probably signifies MS resilience, e.g., resilience to the disease pathogenic mechanisms. These patients are defined as patients with benign disease course and therefore also manifest with less cognitive impairments. Our findings implicate that cognition as a part of the functional neurological spectrum of MS is better reserved in patients with less active disease, as patients with low disability were found to be more cognitively resilient. </p>
<p>Regarding the group of patients who show high cognitive performance despite moderate to severe disability as compared to patients with low cognitive performance despite mild disability, we have specified in the Discussion a possible explanation related to anatomical involvement. We suggest that patients with moderate to severe disability but high cognitive performance the spinal cord will be more involved as compared to patients with mild disability but with low cognitive performance that probably present widespread brain disease and relatively lower spinal cord involvement.</p>
<p>We have added these paragraphs to the Discussion.</p>
<p>minor comments:</p>
<p>3. How were the three groups of cognitive performance and the three groups of neurological disability determined. Please provide references on the categorization of cognitive performance and neurological disability.</p>
<p>Response: As specified in the Methods - Cognitive assessment, last paragraph, the three groups of cognitive performance and the three groups of neurological disability were determined according to the global cognitive score (GCS) and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score as follows:</p>
<p>Cognitive performance was categorized by GCS as &#8220;high&#8221; (GCS &gt;100), &#8220;moderate&#8221; (GCS 85-100) or &#8220;low&#8221; (GCS&lt;85). Neurological disability was classified according to EDSS score as &#8220;mild&#8221; (EDSS &#8804;3), "moderate&#8221; (EDSS 3.5-5.5), or "severe" (EDSS &gt;6.0).</p>
<p>Both are referenced.</p>
<p>We better detailed this by adding the title of Group categorization to this paragraph.</p>
<p>4. Please add in the limitations section that this study included only relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS.</p>
<p>Response: Added.</p>
<p>5. Please elaborate on exclusion criterion 5. How was it determined from chart review whether a patient had severe upper limb or visual impairment?</p>
<p>Response: This exclusion criteria is determined as a part of the cognitive test. Patients that have severe upper limb dysfunction like paralysis or tremor are not able to hold the computer-mouse and therefore are technically excluded from preforming the test. Similarly, at the beginning of the cognitive test visual acuity is assessed and patients that can not read the instructions are technically excluded from performing the test. </p>
<p>The explanation was added to exclusion criterion 5.</p>
<p>6. On that note, visual performance did not differ between the three groups (Table 1), probably because visual impairment was an exclusion criterion. Please add this to the discussion.</p>
<p> Response: Added.</p>
