<abstract>
<p>The impact of black cumin usage on some qualitative properties and formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) in meatball production was investigated. It was found that black cumin usage rate, cooking process and temperature had a significant effect (p&lt;0,01) on the water content, pH, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values of meatballs. On the other hand, black cumin usage significantly (p&lt;0,01) reduced the water content and cooking loss. The water content and cooking loss of the meatballs decreased with increases in the usage rate. While IQx, IQ, MeIQ, 7,8-DiMeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx, A&#945;C, and MeA&#945;C could not be detected in meatballs, varying amounts of MeIQx (up to 1,53 ng/g) and PhIP (up to 1,22 ng/g) were determined. The total amounts of HAAs ranged between non-detected (nd) to 2,75 ng/g. Both the usage rate and cooking temperature had a very significant effect (p&lt;0,01) on the total contents of HAAs. The total amounts of HAAs were decreased in correlation with the increases in the usage rate; the proportion which is increased when the cooking temperature increased as well. Results of the present study suggested that addition of black cumin may have a substantial role in decreasing the TBARS value, cooking loss, and HAA contents during meatball production. Therefore, using of black cumin in meatball production has been suggested.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Foods, complex mixture of the micro compounds such as essential trace elements and vitamins and the macro compounds such as protein, fat, and carbohydrates, play an important role in living organisms with other ingredients such as ditary fibers and antioxidants. On the other hand, various hazards, including microbiological and chemicals can be introduced into the food chain from farm to table. Therefore, nutition not only plays a pivotal role in the prevention of some diseases but also may be considered as a risk factor for some other emerging diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Some epidemiological investigations have revealed the role of nutrition in the development of many comon cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref003">3</xref>]. Recently, it has been widely accepted that some mutagenic and/or carcinogenic substances are formed during cooking of foods rich in protein, such as meat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref005">5</xref>]. The group of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) is of these substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref006">6</xref>]. In 1977, it was reported that some chemical compounds were formed in products such as meat and fish cooked at high temperatures and these compounds were later defined as HAAs, based on their chemical structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>HAAs have two basic chemical groups; 1) Aminoimidazoarenes, IQ type or thermal HAAs, are formed during cooking of food at temperatures of 150&#8211;300 &#176;C. 2) Aminocarbolines, non-IQ type or pyrolitic HAAs, are formed at temperatures above 300 &#176;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref003">3</xref>]. Precursors of HAAs are creatine/creatinine, reducing sugars, amino acids, peptides and proteins, heat and mass transfer, lipids and lipid oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref008">8</xref>]. Compared to other known food mutagens, HAAs were found to be 100-fold more mutagenic than aflatoxin B1 and 2000-fold more mutagenic than benzo[a]pyrene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref003">3</xref>]. On the other hand, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), IQ has been classified as a possible human carcinogen (class 2A) and MelQ, MelQx, PhIP, A&#945;C, MeA&#945;C, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, and Glu-P-1 are labelled as probable human carcinogen (class 2B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref009">9</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of HAAs in foods should be prevented and/or reduced.</p>
<p>Since radical reactions had an important role in the formation of HAAs, and it is, therefore, expected that antioxidants can reduce the formation of HAAs in meat and meat products. Indeed, it was reported that antioxidants could inhibit the formation of HAAs and this effect was explained due to the ability of antioxidants to interfere in different stages of the formation reactions of HAAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref011">11</xref>]. However, same antioxidants had a prooxidant effect depending on their concentration in food and caused an increase in the formation of HAAs. To reduce the formation of HAAs, synthetic and/or natural antioxidants can be added to meat and meat products. Due to their carcinogenic potential, the use of synthetic antioxidants has been banned from European countries and others, such as Japan and Canada, due to their carcinogenic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref013">13</xref>]. Therefore, during the recent years, food rich in natural antioxidants such as plants or spices have gained much attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref014">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Black cumin (<italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L.) is a spice belonging to the family of Ranunculaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref019">19</xref>]. Black cumin is grown in many parts of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref020">20</xref>]. It is reported that the seeds of black cumin contain dietary proteins (26,7%), fats (28,5%), and carbohydrates (40,0%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref020">20</xref>]. In the Traditional Middle Eastern medicine, the seeds have been used as a remedy for treatment of multiple diseases (a natural remedy for asthma, hypertension, diabetes, inflammation, cough, bronchitis, headache, eczema, fever, dizziness and influenza) for more than 2000 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref021">21</xref>]. Black cumin seed essential oil contains high concentrations of thymoquinone (37,6%) and its related compounds such as thymosl and dithymoquinone and p-cymene (31,4%) with minor amounts of longifolene, carvacrol and thymohydroquinone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Black seed showed the most potent radical scavenging better antioxidant activity compared to synthetic antioxidants (BHA and BHT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref019">19</xref>]. In addition, it was documented that black cumin had antimicrobial, anticarcinogen, antioxidant effects and antitumor and antiinflammatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref021">21</xref>]. It is known that the major component in black cumin is thymoquinone compound and this compound is considered to be a nutritional component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref022">22</xref>] and thymoquinone is also considered as potent antioxidant, antiinflammatory, anticarcinogen, antibacterial, antifungal, and antimutagenic agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>So far, various studies dealing with the addition of natural and synthetic antioxidants and also food additives to meat and meat products have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref014">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref023">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref027">27</xref>], however, to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies are concerned with the effects of black cumin on the formation of HAAs. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of adding of black cumin (0,5 and 1%) in meatball preparation on the formation of HAAs in meatball cooked at different cooking temperatures (150&#176;C, 200&#176;C and 250&#176;C) as well as on the various quality criteria of meatballs.</p>

<title>Raw materials</title>
<p>Beef muscle (M. <italic>Gluteus medius</italic>) and intermuscular fat were obtained from a local slaughterhouse (Meat and Milk Institution, Erzurum, Turkey). All subcutaneous fats on meat were removed and used after homogenization. The fat content of meatball dough was adjusted to 15% fat with the intermuscular fat from the same carcass. Black cumin was purchased from a spice store in Erzurum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>HAA standards</title>
<p>The HAA standards were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). 4,7,8-TriMeIQx was used as an internal standard. The stock solutions were prepared according to the method described by Oz and &#199;akmak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Preparation of meatballs</title>
<p>The meatball dough with 15% fat was divided into three portions; one portion was used as control group (without addition of black cumin), and black cumin was added to other portions at two different rates (0,50 and 1%). All groups were shaped into meatballs (7 x 1 cm) after one night storage at 4&#176;C. No salt or spices were added to meatball dough to avoid any possible interaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Cooking conditions</title>
<p>Hot plate heated to 150&#176;C, 200&#176;C and 250&#176;C without any fat or oil was used for the cooking of the meatballs. All samples were turned over after half the cooking time (8 min). The surface temperature was measured by a digital thermocouple with a surface probe (Testo 926, Lenzkirch, Germany).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Water content</title>
<p>Water contents of the meatballs were determined as weight loss of 10 g homogenized samples following dryness at 102&#176;C for 24 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>pH value</title>
<p>pH values were measured in the samples which was homogenized with distilled water (1:10 w/v) using a pH meter (ATI ORION 420, MA 02129, USA). The pH meter was calibrated using buffer solutions (pH 4.0 and pH 7.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Cooking loss</title>
<p>Weight of the meatballs was measured before and after cooking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>TBARS value</title>
<p>Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values of the samples were determined by the method of K&#305;l&#305;&#231; and Richards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref031">31</xref>]. The absorbance of the samples was measured at a wavelength of 532 nm aganist blank. 1, 1, 3, 3- tetraethoxypropane was used fort he calculation of k value. Results were expressed as mg malondialdehyde (MDA)/kg sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Determination of HAA content</title>
<p>The HAAs contnet of the samples was determined according to Messner and Murkovic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref032">32</xref>] with minor modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref001">1</xref>]. Solid phase extraction method (Oasis cartridges, 3 cm<sup>3</sup>/60 mg Waters, Milford, MA) was used for the analysis. For this aim, 1 g meatball sample was dissolved in 12 ml 1 M NaOH. The suspension was homogenised by using a magnetic stirring for 1 h at 500 rpm at room temperature. The alkaline solution was mixed with 13 g diatomaceous earth (Extrelut NT packaging material, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and then poured into empty Extrelut columns. The extractions were made by using 75 ml ethyl acetate and the eluate was passed through coupled Oasis MCX cartridges. The cartridge was washed with 2 ml of 0.1 M HCl and 2 ml MeOH. The analytes were eluted with 2 ml of MeOH-concentrated (25%) ammonia (19/1, v/v). The eluted mixtures were evaporated to dryness at 50&#176;C and the final extracts were dissolved in 100 &#956;l MeOH just before measurement. A mixture of purified water/acetonitrile/methanol/glacial acetic acid (76/14/8/2, v/v/v/v) at pH 5,0 (adjusted with ammonium hydroxide 25%) was used as Solvent A, while solvent B was acetonitrile (100%). Separation process was conducted on AcclaimTM 120 C18 3 &#956;m (4,6 x 150 mm) Tosoh Bioscience GmbH (Stuttgart, Germany) at 35&#176;C. The flow rate was 0,7 ml/min. The gradient programme was as follows: 0% B, 0&#8211;10 min; 0&#8211;23% B, 11&#8211;20 min; 23% B, 21&#8211;30 min; 0% B, 31&#8211;45 min. The injection volume was 10 ml.</p>

<title>Water contents of the meatballs</title>
<p>The water contents of the meatballs were given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221680.t002">Table 2</xref>. There was a very significant effect (p&lt;0,01) of usage rate of black cumin, cooking process and cooking temperature on the water contents of the meatballs. The addition of black cumin to meatball dough significantly reduced the water content compared to the control group samples (p&lt;0,05). As the usage rate of black cumin increased, the water content of the samples decreased. The decrease in the water content of meatballs with adding the black cumin is attributable to the high dry matter content of the black cumin used in the present study (95,70%). Cooking, as expected, caused a decrease in the water content of the samples; the finding which is consistent with others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref038">38</xref>]. In addition, it was also determined that the water content of the samples decreased as the cooking temperature increased. del Pulgar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref039">39</xref>] reported the three main reasons for water loss in meat during cooking process. First, as temperature increases so does the process of evaporation. Second, heating caused denaturation of myosin and shrinkage of myofibrils, which in turn lead to a reduction in the myofibril&#8217;s ability to hold water. Finally, a contraction of the perimysial connective tissue causes a compression of the muscle fiber bundles; in accordance this could enhance water release from the meat cut.</p>

<title>pH values of the meatballs</title>
<p>pH values of the meatballs were also given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221680.t002">Table 2</xref>. There was a very significant effect (p&lt;0,01) of usage rate of black cumin, cooking process and cooking temperature on the pH values of the meatballs. Black cumin usage in the meatball preparation significantly increased the pH values compared to the control group samples (p&lt;0,05). The pH of the samples was increased with the increased usage rate of black cumin. The increase in pH value of meatballs with adding the black cumin could be attributed to the high pH value of the black cumin used in the present study (6,22). Cooking, as expected, caused an increase in pH values of the samples and this finding is in accordance with that reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref040">40</xref>]. In addition, in the present study, it was also determined that the pH values of the samples increased as the cooking temperature increased. Oz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref040">40</xref>] found pH value of 6,09 and 6,17 in raw and cooked meatballs, respectively. The reason behind the increase in pH value of meat owing to cooking might be attributed to the cleavage of bonds involving imidazole, sulfhydryl and hydroxyl groups as reported by Girard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref041">41</xref>].</p>

There was a very significant effect (p&lt;0,01) of usage rate of black cumin, cooking process and cooking temperature on the TBARS values of the meatballs. Adding of black cumin usage in the meatball preparation significantly reduced TBARS values compared to the control group samples (p&lt;0,05). As the usage rate of black cumin increased, the TBARS values of the samples decreased. The antioxidant effect of black cumin on TBARS value was believed to be due to its phenolic compound. It is known that antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds is linked to their high redox potentials that would allow them to act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref019">19</xref>]. In addition, it was determined that cooking caused an increase in TBARS values of the samples and the cooking temperature increased, TBARS values of the samples increased. Due to the fact that cooking destroys the cellular structure and inactivates enzymes enabling oxygen to become free from oxymyoglobin, cooking is one of the main reasons of lipid oxidation in meat and meat products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref042">42</xref>].</p>

<p>Rodriguez-Estrada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref045">45</xref>] reported that there is a decrease in the weights of meat products as a result of the cooking process; it is assumed that water is removed. Cooking not only removes meat juice from the meat but also some water-soluble compounds therein. Indeed, according to Gerber et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref046">46</xref>], Laroche declared that meat juices removed during cooking contain some compounds such as myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic proteins, collagen, lipids, salt, polyphosphates, and aroma compounds.</p>

<p>MeIQx was determined in all of the meatballs cooked at 200&#176;C and 250&#176;C, however, the compound could not be detected in the meatballs cooked at 150&#176;C.

On the other hand, PhIP was determined in all of the meatballs cooked at 250&#176;C. In the control group meatballs, as the cooking temperature increased, PhIP content increased. The use of black cumin in the preparation of meatball caused a reduction in PhIP content of the samples cooked at 200&#176;C and 250&#176;C.

<p>Total HAA content of the meatballs ranged from 0,5&#8211;2,75 ng/g, whereas in the case of meatballs cooked at 150&#176;C HAAs were not detected. It was determined that increases in the cooking temperature would increase the total HAAs of both control and meatballs supplemented with black cumin. While the total HAA content of the control group meatballs cooked at 150&#176;C was not detectable, the total HAA contents of the control group meatballs cooked at 200&#176;C and 250&#176;C were 0,90 ng/g and 2,75 ng/g, respectively. On the other hand, the total HAA content of the meatballs including black cumin at 0,5% and cooked at 150&#176;C was not detectable, whereas the total HAA contents of those meatballs cooked at 200&#176;C and 250&#176;C were 0,50 ng/g and 1,85 ng/g, respectively. While the total HAA content of the meatballs including black cumin at 1% and cooked at 150&#176;C was not detectable, the total HAA contents of those meatballs cooked at 200&#176;C and 250&#176;C were 0,35 ng/g and 1,51 ng/g, respectively. It was also found that the use of black cumin in the preparation of meatball caused a reduction in total HAA content of the samples and as the use rate of black cumin increased, the total HAA content of the meatballs decreased. While the total HAA content of the meatballs including black cumin cooked at 150&#176;C was not detectable, the use of black cumin at 0,5% in meatball production caused a reduction on the total HAA content of the meatballs cooked at 200&#176;C (44,44%) and at 250&#176;C (32,73%). Similarly, the use of black cumin at 1% in meatball production also caused a reduction on the total HAA content of the meatballs cooked at 200&#176;C (32,73%) and at 250&#176;C (45,09%). On the other hand, the total HAA contents of the meatballs cooked at 200&#176;C were belonging to MeIQx compound. While the total HAA contents of the control group meatballs cooked at 250&#176;C were determined to be consisted of MeIQx (55,64%) and PhIP (44,36%), the total HAA contents of the meatballs containing different amounts of black cumin and cooked at the same temperature were consisted of MeIQx (54,05&#8211;56,95%) and PhIP (43,05&#8211;45,95%).</p>
<p>Oz and Kaya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref016">16</xref>] investigated the effect of black pepper on the formation of HAA and found that the total HAA (IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx, and PhIP) content ranged between 1,40&#8211;37,81 ng/g in their control group meatballs cooked at 175&#8211;250&#176;C. The researchers declared that use of black pepper at 1% inhibited total HAA content up to 100%.</p>
<p>Shin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref014">14</xref>] found that the addition of 20 g of minced garlic cloves to ground beef patties would reduce the total HAAs (MeIQx, DiMeIQx and PhIP) by 68%. In another study conducted the same group, it was reported that 24.6 ng/g total HAA (MeIQx, DiMeIQx, and PhIP) was determined in control group fried at 225&#176;C for 20 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref015">15</xref>]. The authors also found that the addition of diallyl disulfide and dipropyl disulfide to ground beef patties inhibited total HAA formation by up to 78% and 70%, respectively.</p>
<p>The use of spices with antioxidant properties in meat preparation could interfere with different stages of HAA formation. The exact mechanism of inhibiting the HAA formation by antioxidants is still not fully understood. However, it has been generally accepted that antioxidants inactivate free radicals. Due to their antiradical activity, antioxidants could act as inhibitors in the mutagens formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref010">10</xref>]. On the other hand, it was justified that prooxidant or antioxidant effect of antioxidants was highly dependent upon the concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref025">25</xref>]. In this context, Oz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref038">38</xref>] investigated the effect of direct addition of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) to beef chops cooked at 150&#176;C, 200&#176;C and 250&#176;C on formation of HAAs and found that while direct addition of 0.05% CLA to beef chops increased (3.85&#8211;68.75%) total HAA amount at all cooking temperatures, direct addition of 0.1% CLA to the beef chops decreased (18,75&#8211;31,54%) the total HAA amount at all cooking temperatures. Similarly, Oz and &#199;akmak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref028">28</xref>] investigated the effects of CLA usage in meatball production on the formation of HAA in meatballs and found that the use of CLA displayed an inhibitory as well as a stimulatory on total HAA content of meatballs depending on the usage rate and cooking temperatures.</p>
<p>In terms of total HAAs content, it is somehow difficult to compare the results of the present study with the others. This is due to the fact that the current study is the first study on the effect of black cumin usage in the preparation of meatball on the formation of HAAs. On the other hand, the amount of total HAAs in the present study was lower than other studies. The little differences might be arise from the type of the meat used, animal feeding conditions, the various cooking conditions, extraction methods, and type of chromatographic detection systems. On the other hand, according to Knize et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref070">70</xref>], who cited data by Pearson and others, the total amounts of IQ, MeIQx, and DiMeIQx were 7300 ng/g in beef fried at 215&#176;C; the value which is considerably higher than both results of the present study and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref014">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, it is seen that even if 100 g of the control group meatballs at 250&#176;C whose total amount of HAA content is the highest, is eaten, the intake amount is quite far below the maximum acceptable daily consumption (15 &#956;g/day) stated by Skog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221680.ref005">5</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As a conclusion, the results showed that adding black cumin to meatball would reduce the levels of both individual HAAs (MeIQx and PhIP) and total HAAs. The inhibitory effect of black cumin on HAAs could be attributed to the antioxidant effect of its phenolic compounds.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Dear Editor,</p>
<p>The article is deal with the inhibitory effect of black seed on the formation of heterocyclic amines in meatball. The topic is interest and the article is good and easy to follow. It can be published in your journal after done necessary corrections. My specific comments and questions about the article are below.</p>
<p>- The author should use black cumin or Nigella sativa throughout the article.</p>
<p>- Title: The title of the article should be &#8220;Inhibitory effects of black cumin on the formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines in meatball&#8221;.</p>
<p>- Page 2, line 31: significantly reduced? Give P values in statistical analysis.</p>
<p>- Page 4, line 98-99: No need to this sentence, repetition for the above stated sentence (line 83-84).</p>
<p>- Page 6, line 143: blind or blank?</p>
<p>- Page 7, line 151: distilled water or purified water?</p>
<p>- Page 15, line 349-350: What do you mean? This sentence is not clear.</p>
<p>- Page 16, line 377: Give the references.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The paper is very interesting. From chemical point of view, there is nothing new, just another scenario of Maillard reaction. The data are brief and clear. The paper is well written. And it includes the relevant literature. It seems from the data presented that the black cumin can prevent the formation of genotoxic mutagenic amines to some extent. Taking into account nutritional aspects, it is a valuable finding. Therefore, I recommend the present study to be published as it is.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: In my opinion this manuscript may be published in PLOS ONE only after a major revision. Generally, English must be improved. In this study, the Authors estimated the effect of use of black cumin in meatball preparation on formation of HAAs. In my opinion, it would improve a paper a lot if the Authors added (e.g., in introduction) any information about black cumin as a source of antioxidants. Beside essentiale oil containing mainly carvone and limonen, black cumin seeds may contain also phenolic acids (e.g., caffeic acid), flavonoids, leuco-anthocyanins that may have a crucial role in scavenging of free radicals. The last ones may be responsible for formation of HHAs.</p>
<p>The remaining comments to the Authors are given below.</p>

<p>Page 3 line 64 &#8222; HAAs were found to be&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;HAAs content (or level) were found to be 100-fold higher&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 3 line 75 According to the Authors &#8222;some antioxidants had a prooxidant effect&#8221;, however,</p>
<p>the same antioxidants could possess prooxidant or antioxidant activity depending on their concentration in food&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 4 line 80 &#8222;natural antioxidants&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;food rich in natural antioxidants such as&#8221;, line 83 &#8222;protein, fat and carbohydrate&#8221; should be changed into &#8222;proteins, fats and harbohydrates&#8221;</p>

<p>Page 6 line 150 It is not clear in which way the mentioned solvents were used during the solid phase extraction methods, so a more detailed description of the SPE extraction is needed</p>
<p>Page 7 line 153 Please, give a information that the gradient method was used during chromatographic analysis, moreover, 3 mm should be changed into 3&#181;m (in case of particles diameter)</p>
<p>Page 7 line 161 Please, use the same designation in the description of Table 1 as in Table 1 (eg. &#8222;meat&#8221; in Table 1 and &#8222;beef muscle&#8221; in line 161</p>

<p>Page 13 line 314 &#8222;ranged between nd &#8211; 2,75 ng/g&#8221; should be changed into &#8222; ranged from 0,5 &#8211; 2,75 ng/g, whereas in the case of meatballs cooked at 150&#176;C HAAs were not detected&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 15 line 355 &#8222;radical quenchers and free radical scavenging activity are designation of the same phenomenon &#8211; antiradical activity</p>
<p>Page 16 line 373 &#8222;the chromatographic detector&#8221; should be changed as &#8222; type of chromatographic detection&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 16 lines 382&amp;385 The last sentence is not so adequate to the conclusion of this manuscript</p>
<p>Table 2 The Authors have given the values of determinated parameters in first line named as Usage rate (0-1) but nothin is known about temperature of cooking (in case of first line), so detailed information could be helpful for the readers (under the table or in the text),</p>
<p>With respect to the values of parameters given in line No 3 named as cooking temperature, did the Authors give the average values for various usage rate (0&#8211;1 %), please to explain</p>

<p>- The author should use black cumin or Nigella sativa throughout the article.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black cumin&#8221; was used throughout the article. </p>
<p>- Title: The title of the article should be &#8220;Inhibitory effects of black cumin on the formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines in meatball&#8221;.</p>
<p>I would like to thank for the reviewer comment. The title of the article has been changed as &#8220;Inhibitory effects of black cumin on the formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines in meatball&#8221;.</p>
<p>- Page 2, line 31: significantly reduced? Give P values in statistical analysis.</p>
<p>P value has been added to the sentence.</p>
<p>- Page 4, line 98-99: No need to this sentence, repetition for the above stated sentence (line 83-84).</p>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer&#8217;s attention. The second sentence has been discarded form the text.</p>
<p>- Page 6, line 143: blind or blank?</p>
<p>&#8220;Blind&#8221; has been changed as &#8220;blank&#8221;.</p>
<p>- Page 7, line 151: distilled water or purified water?</p>
<p>&#8220;Water&#8221; has been changed as &#8220;purified water&#8221;</p>
<p>- Page 15, line 349-350: What do you mean? This sentence is not clear.</p>
<p>Thank you. The sentence has been modified.</p>
<p>- Page 16, line 377: Give the references.</p>
<p>The references have been added to the text.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The paper is very interesting. From chemical point of view, there is nothing new, just another scenario of Maillard reaction. The data are brief and clear. The paper is well written.

In my opinion, it would improve a paper a lot if the Authors added (e.g., in introduction) any information about black cumin as a source of antioxidants. Beside essentiale oil containing mainly carvone and limonen, black cumin seeds may contain also phenolic acids (e.g., caffeic acid), flavonoids, leuco-anthocyanins that may have a crucial role in scavenging of free radicals. The last ones may be responsible for formation of HHAs.</p>
<p>I would like to thank you for the reviewer&#8217;s useful comment. A native speaker has checked the article and the necessary corrections have been done on it. About the antioxidant activity of the black cumin, black cumin seeds contain fixed oil and volatile oil including thymoquinone and monoterpenes such as r-cymene and a-piene. However, it is reported that thymoquinone is major component of black cumin and it is considered as potent antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic. In the present study, usage of black cumin in meatball production inhibited the formation of HAAs (not promoted) and its inhibitory effect could be attributed to its thymoquinone content. The sentence about the antioxidative properties of black cumin has been modified. </p>
<p>The remaining comments to the Authors are given below.</p>
<p>Page 3 line 58 &#8222;aminoimidazoaazoarenes&#8221; shouild be changed into &#8222;aminoimidazoarenes&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer&#8217;s attention. &#8220;aminoimidazoaazoarenes&#8221; has  been changed as &#8220;aminoimidazoarenes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Page 3 line 63 It is not clear if antioxidants are precursors of HAAs ort hey may play a role of inhibitors of HAAs or any others contaminants</p>
<p>The reviewer is right. Therefore, the word of &#8220;antioxidants&#8221; has been discarded from the text.</p>
<p>Page 3 line 64 &#8222; HAAs were found to be&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;HAAs content (or level) were found to be 100-fold higher&#8221;</p>
<p>In here, I compared the mutagenicities of HAAs and the other known food mutagens such as aflatoxin B1 and benzo(a)pyrene. However, the sentence has been modified.</p>
<p>Page 3 line 75 According to the Authors &#8222;some antioxidants had a prooxidant effect&#8221;, however,</p>
<p>the same antioxidants could possess prooxidant or antioxidant activity depending on their concentration in food&#8221;</p>
<p>The sentence has been modified.</p>
<p>Page 4 line 80 &#8222;natural antioxidants&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;food rich in natural antioxidants such as&#8221;, line 83 &#8222;protein, fat and carbohydrate&#8221; should be changed into &#8222;proteins, fats and harbohydrates&#8221;</p>
<p>The corrections have been done. Thank you.</p>
<p>Page 4 line 90 &#8222;carvacrola&#8221; should be changed into &#8222;carvacrol&#8221;, line 95 &#8222; antiinflamatory&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;antiinflamatory activity (or properties)&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 4 lines 96&amp;98 &#8222;thymokinone&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;thymoquinone&#8221;</p>
<p>The corrections have been done. Thank you.</p>
<p>Page 4 lines 98&amp;99 The last sentence is the exact repetition what was written before (lines 83&amp;84)</p>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer&#8217;s attention. The sentence has been discarded form the text.</p>
<p>Page 5 line 101 &#8222;food ingredients&#8221; should be changed as &#8222;food additives&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;food ingredients&#8221; has been changed as &#8220;food additives&#8221;.</p>
<p>Page 6 line 150 It is not clear in which way the mentioned solvents were used during the solid phase extraction methods, so a more detailed description of the SPE extraction is needed</p>
<p>Thank you. The part of SPE has been modified.</p>
<p>Page 7 line 153 Please, give a information that the gradient method was used during chromatographic analysis, moreover, 3 mm should be changed into 3&#181;m (in case of particles diameter)</p>
<p>Gradient programme has been added to the text and 3 mm has been changed as 3 &#181;m. Thank you.</p>
<p>Page 7 line 161 Please, use the same designation in the description of Table 1 as in Table 1 (eg. &#8222;meat&#8221; in Table 1 and &#8222;beef muscle&#8221; in line 161</p>
<p>&#8220;Beef muscle&#8221; has been changed as &#8220;meat&#8221;.</p>
<p>Page 8 line 199 &#8222;groups by Girard&#8221; should be changed as &#8222; groups as reported by Girard&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you. The correction has been done. </p>
<p>Page 13 line 314 &#8222;ranged between nd &#8211; 2,75 ng/g&#8221; should be changed into &#8222; ranged from 0,5 &#8211; 2,75 ng/g, whereas in the case of meatballs cooked at 150&#176;C HAAs were not detected&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you. The correction has been done in the text.</p>
<p>Page 15 line 355 &#8222;radical quenchers and free radical scavenging activity are designation of the same phenomenon &#8211; antiradical activity</p>
<p>This part has been corrected.</p>
<p>Page 16 line 373 &#8222;the chromatographic detector&#8221; should be changed as &#8222; type of chromatographic detection&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you. The correction has been done in the text.</p>
<p>Page 16 lines 382&amp;385 The last sentence is not so adequate to the conclusion of this manuscript</p>
<p>The reviewer is right. Therefore, the sentence has been moved to results and discussion section. Thank you.</p>
<p>Table 2 The Authors have given the values of determinated parameters in first line named as Usage rate (0-1) but nothin is known about temperature of cooking (in case of first line), so detailed information could be helpful for the readers (under the table or in the text),</p>
<p>With respect to the values of parameters given in line No 3 named as cooking temperature, did the Authors give the average values for various usage rate (0&#8211;1 %), please to explain</p>
<p>Thank you for your comment. Table 2 shows the average values of the results. Therefore, n (number of sample) was added to the Table 2. I think n explains the situation.</p>
<p>The revised manuscript has been resubmitted to your journal. I look forward to your positive response as soon as possible. Is there anything I can do for that, please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Dr. Oz</p>
