<title>Background</title>
<p>Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is criticized by some as an expensive treatment in super-elder patients with limited life expectancy. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the magnitude of clinical benefit provided by TAVI in comparison with conservative management in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) in real clinical practice, which would be important in the decision making for TAVI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We combined two independent registries, namely CURRENT AS and K-TAVI registries. CURRENT AS was a multicenter registry enrolling 3815 consecutive patients with severe AS irrespective to treatment modalities between January 2003 and December 2011. K-TAVI was a multicenter, prospective registry including 449 consecutive patients with severe AS, who underwent TAVI with SAPIEN XT balloon-expandable valves between October 2013 and June 2016. In these 2 registries, 449 patients received TAVI and 894 patients were managed with conservative strategy. We conducted propensity score matching and finally obtained a cohort of 556 patients (278 patients for each group) for the analysis. The primary outcome measures were all-cause death and heart failure (HF) hospitalization at 2-year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The cumulative 2-year incidences of all-cause death and HF hospitalization were significantly lower in the TAVI group than in the conservative group (16.8% versus 36.6%, P&lt;0.001, and 10.7% versus 37.2%, P&lt;0.001). After adjusting the residual confounders, TAVI reduced the risks of all-cause death (HR, 0.46; 95%CI, 0.32&#8211;0.69; P = 0.0001) and HF hospitalizations (HR, 0.25; 95%CI, 0.16&#8211;0.40; P&lt;0.0001) compared with conservative strategy. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of non-cardiovascular death between the 2 groups.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>TAVI in the early Japanese experience was associated with striking risk reduction for all-cause death as well as HF hospitalization as compared with the historical cohort of patients with severe AS who were managed conservatively just before introduction of TAVI in Japan.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) had been the only option to improve the clinical outcomes, and has been recommended as a class&#8544;indication in the guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref001">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref006">6</xref>]. However, one of the biggest drawbacks in the management of patients with severe AS was that substantial proportion of symptomatic patients with severe AS did not receive SAVR due to advanced age, severe comorbidities, or patient rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref007">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref009">9</xref>]. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has already transformed the treatment paradigm of symptomatic patients with severe AS. In severe AS patients with high or intermediate risk for SAVR, several randomized trials clearly demonstrated that TAVI was associated with the long-term clinical outcomes at least comparable to SAVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref010">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref014">14</xref>]. Furthermore, in patients with severe AS who were not suitable for SAVR, the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) trial comparing TAVI with standard treatment demonstrated better outcomes for TAVI up to 5-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref015">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref018">18</xref>]. Based on these landmark clinical trials, the proportion of symptomatic severe AS patients treated with aortic valve replacement by either SAVR or TAVI clearly increased after introduction of TAVI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>However, there is a knowledge gap regarding how much clinical benefit could be provided by TAVI in comparison with conservative management in patients with severe AS in real clinical practice. The expected magnitude of clinical benefit would be important in the decision making for TAVI in real world patients with severe AS. Against this background, we sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent TAVI in the early Japanese experience in comparison with the historical cohort of patients who were managed conservatively just before introduction of TAVI in Japan.</p>

<title>Study population</title>
<p>We combined two independent registries in Japan, K-TAVI (Kyoto University-related hospital Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) registry and CURRENT AS (Contemporary outcomes after sURgery and medical tREatmeNT in patients with severe Aortic Stenosis) registry, to make a historical comparison of the clinical outcomes between TAVI and conservative management in patients with severe AS.</p>
<p>K-TAVI registry was a multicenter and prospective registry enrolling consecutive patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI at 6 centers starting from October 2013. The selection of patients and the procedures of the K-TAVI registry were previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref020">20</xref>]. For the present analysis, we included 449 patients who underwent TAVI with SAPIEN XT (Edwards Lifesciences, CA, USA) from October 2013 to June 2016 in the K-TAVI registry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222979.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The CURRENT AS registry was a multicenter, retrospective registry that enrolled consecutive patients with severe AS irrespective to treatment modalities from 27 centers (on-site surgical facilities: 20 centers) just before introduction of TAVI in Japan from January 2003 to December 2011. All the 6 centers that participated in the K-TAVI registry had also participated in the CURRENT AS registry. Severe AS was defined as peak aortic jet velocity (V<sub>max</sub>) &gt;4.0m/s, mean aortic pressure gradient (PG) &gt;40mmHg, or aortic valve area (AVA) &lt;1.0cm<sup>2</sup>. The detailed design and results of the registry have been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref021">21</xref>]. Among 3815 patients enrolled in the CURRENT AS registry, conservative management was initially chosen in 2618 patients. To identify the patients with conservative management comparable to the patients in the K-TAVI registry, we excluded those patients on hemodialysis (HD) in whom TAVI has not been yet approved in Japan, and those asymptomatic patients with Vmax &lt;5m/s and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; = 50%, who are regarded as candidates for watchful waiting according to the guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref004">4</xref>]. We also excluded those patients who were regarded as contraindicated for SAVR by the attending physicians (malnutrition, muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, and expected poor prognosis), because these patients were considered to be contraindicated for TAVI. Finally, we retrieved the data of 984 non-HD patients in the conservative group who were symptomatic or asymptomatic but with V<sub>max</sub> &#8805;5 m/s, or with LVEF of &lt;50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222979.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The follow-up was commenced on the day of TAVI in the K-TAVI registry and on the day of index echocardiography in the conservative group from CURRENT AS registry. Follow-up was censored at 2-year in both groups considering the minimal follow-up interval in the K-TAVI registry. We obtained clinical follow-up data from the medical records and/or through mail exchanges and/or telephone interviews with the patients, families, or referring physicians.</p>
<p>The relevant institutional review boards at all participating hospitals approved the study protocols and were described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222979.s003">S3 Text</xref>. We performed the study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent specific for the K-TAVI registry was waived because patients undergoing TAVI provided written informed consent for the compulsory national clinical database registry, and it was also waived in the CURRENT AS registry because of the retrospective study design.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Study outcomes</title>
<p>Valve implantation was regarded as successful, if the procedure was completed without valve delivery failure, second valve implantation, annulus rupture and conversion to open heart surgery. Device success and other procedural endpoints of TAVI was defined based on the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref022">22</xref>]. The primary outcome measures of the current study were all-cause death and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations at 2-year. The secondary outcome measures included aortic valve-related death, aortic valve procedure death, cardiovascular death, sudden death, non-cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding, infectious endocarditis, and a composite of aortic valve-related deaths or HF hospitalization. Aortic valve-related death included aortic valve procedure death, sudden death, and death due to HF possibly related to aortic valve. HF hospitalization was defined as hospitalization due to worsening HF requiring intravenous drug therapy. Major bleeding in this study was defined as life-threatening/disabling or major bleeding in the VARC-2 classification. Definitions of other clinical events are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222979.s004">S4 Text</xref>. Clinical events were adjudicated by the clinical event committee (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222979.s001">S1 Text</xref>) in the CURRENT AS registry, while site-reported events were not adjudicated in the K-TAVI registry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We expressed continuous variables as mean &#177; standard deviation or median with interquartile range (IQR), and compared them using Student&#8217;s t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. We expressed categorical variables as percentages and compared them using &#967;<sup>2</sup> tests.</p>
<p>We used propensity score matching as the main analysis, because the patient characteristics were different between the TAVI and conservative groups derived from the 2 separate registries. Once we combined data of 984 patients from CURRENT AS registry and 449 patients from K-TAVI registry, we used multivariable logistic regression model to develop propensity-score for the choice of TAVI with 13 variables relevant to the choice of AVR used in our previous study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222979.t001">Table 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref021">21</xref>]. We multiplied these variables in each patient by the coefficients in the model to calculate propensity score of each patient. The c-statistics was 0.818 and the coefficients of the independent variables were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222979.s014">S1 Table</xref>. We then calculated the propensity score by summing up all coefficients multiplies corresponding variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222979.s005">S1 Fig</xref>). To make propensity-score matched cohort, patients in the TAVI group were matched to those in the conservative group using a 1:1 greedy matching technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref023">23</xref>]. We eliminated those patients without counterparts with corresponding propensity score, and finally constructed the propensity score-matched cohort of 556 patients (TAVI group 278 patients, and conservative group 278 patients), and used Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate cumulative incidences. Log-rank test was used to assess the differences between groups. Because some variables were not well balanced even after the propensity score matching, we performed further adjustment by using the Cox proportional hazard models incorporating the risk-adjusting variables such as Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)-predicted risk of mortality (PROM), V<sub>max</sub>, and aortic valve area (AVA). We evaluated hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the risk of the TAVI group relative to the conservative group for each outcome measure.</p>

<p>As a sensitivity analysis, we constructed Cox proportional hazards models incorporating 18 clinically relevant risk-adjusting variables listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222979.t001">Table 1</xref> among the entire cohort of 1433 patients (TAVI group, 449 patients, and conservative group, 984 patients). We also performed another sensitivity analysis in the propensity score-matched cohort excluding those patients who died within 30 days after the index echocardiography in the conservative group, because enrollment date of K-TAVI registry was not the index echocardiography date but the TAVI procedure date, and there was possibility that some patients scheduled for TAVI had died before actually undergoing TAVI procedure.</p>
<p>We also performed subgroup analyses in terms of age, sex, STS score, LVEF, and high/low gradient AS in the propensity-score matched cohort. Age and STS score were dichotomized by the median values, while LVEF was dichotomized by &gt; = 50% and &lt;50%.</p>
<p>We considered a 2-sided P-value of &lt;0.05 to be significant for all tests. All analyses were performed using JMP 14.0.0 or SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p>

<p>In the entire cohort, patients in the TAVI group were older than those in the conservative group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222979.t001">Table 1</xref>). The age distribution in the range of &gt; = 85 years of age was comparable in the TAVI group and the conservative group, while the proportion of patients with &lt;85 years of age was smaller in the TAVI group than in the conservative group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222979.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

<title>Characteristics and procedural outcomes of TAVI</title>
<p>In terms of procedural characteristics in the TAVI group, trans-femoral approach was selected only in 63% of patients, and the vast majority of patients underwent TAVI under general anesthesia.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main finding of the present study was that TAVI in the early Japanese experience was associated with striking risk reduction for all-cause death as well as HF hospitalization as compared with the historical cohort of patients with severe AS who were managed conservatively just before introduction of TAVI in Japan.</p>
<p>TAVI is now widely accepted and has already revolutionized the treatment of severe AS. TAVI have been has been adopted rapidly for patients who are at high surgical risk in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref024">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref027">27</xref>]. However, TAVI is criticized by some as an expensive treatment in super-elder patients with limited life expectancy. Measuring the magnitude of benefit provided by TAVI as compared with conservative management is essential to discuss the cost-effectiveness of TAVI. In the PARTNER randomized trial, TAVI as compared with standard treatment was associated with relative 44% risk reduction for all-cause death and 59% risk reduction for re-hospitalization at 2-year follow-up in patients with severe AS who were not suitable for SAVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref016">16</xref>]. In the real clinical practice, however, conservative management had often been selected in symptomatic severe AS patients who are high-risk but not unsuitable for SAVR, while TAVI has often been chosen in this group of patients. Therefore, the magnitude of benefit provided by TAVI as compared with conservative management could not be fully assessed in the PARTNER randomized trial. However, there was no previous study exploring how much clinical benefit could be provided by TAVI in comparison with conservative management in patients with severe AS in the real clinical practice. The 2 registries analyzed in the present study, one in the pre-TAVI era, and the other in the TAVI era, could present a unique opportunity to assess the clinical impact of TAVI relative to conservative management in the real world patients with severe AS. In the present propensity score matched analysis, TAVI as compared with conservative management was associated with striking 54% risk reduction for all-cause death and 75% risk reduction for HF hospitalization at 2-year follow-up. High rate of successful valve implantation, low complication rate and very low 30-day mortality rate were also striking, given the fact that this was the very early TAI experience using the prototype device in Japan. Initial procedural risk is usually the tax to pay for the expected long-term benefit of any invasive treatment. However, in the present study, 30-day mortality was significantly lower in the TAVI group than in the conservative group, highlighting the low procedural risk of TAVI as well as very poor prognosis of patients with severe AS when managed conservatively. Furthermore, the 2-year mortality rate after TAVI was only 16.8% in the present study as compared with 43.3% in the PARTNER trial, indicating that the life expectancy of patients undergoing TAVI in the real world was not so short as shown among the inoperable patients enrolled in the PARTNER trial. In line with the marked reduction of HF hospitalization by TAVI in the present study, TAVI is also reported to be associated with marked improvement of symptoms and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref028">28</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref031">31</xref>]. The present study is not a formal cost-effectiveness analysis of TAVI. Nevertheless, given the substantial mortality and morbidity benefit of TAVI, the door to TAVI should not be closed due to the cost issues.</p>
<p>There were some negative aspects for TAVI in the present study. Stroke and major bleeding at 30-day were more frequent in the TAVI group than in the conservative group. The long-term risk for infective endocarditis trended to be higher in the TAVI group than in the conservative group. However, the observed mortality and morbidity benefit of TAVI far outweighed these negative aspects for TAVI. The use of newer generation devices has already reduced the incidence of peri-operative stroke and major bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222979.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>There are several important limitations in this study. First, we combined 2 different registries for the present analysis. We developed the propensity-score for the choice of TAVI in the data set derived from 2 different registries, which might not be a formal way of developing propensity-score. However, the sensitivity analysis using multivariable Cox proportional hazard model in the entire cohort provided the fully consistent results with the propensity-score matched analysis. Nevertheless, we could not exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounding. Second, we conducted a comparison between the 2 registries that enrolled patients just before and after introduction of TAVI in Japan, in which the limitations associated with historical comparison were inevitable. However, we do not have good methodology other than historical comparison to estimate the impact of TAVI in the real clinical practice. The 2 multicenter observational studies conducted among the same group of investigators actually provided very unique opportunity to estimate the magnitude of benefit provided by TAVI. Third, we did not know the number of patients who were turned down for TAVI during enrollment in K-TAVI registry. However, we excluded those patients in the CURENT AS registry who were regarded as contraindicated for SAVR by the attending physicians, because some of these patients might also be contraindicated for TAVI. Fourth, we did not assess the symptomatic status of patients in the K-TAVI registry. History of acute HF hospitalization, which would have substantial prognostic impact, could not be adjusted in the comparison between TAVI and conservative management. Fifth, patients who underwent TAVI were early experience data in Japan, therefore about 37% of patients were selected alternative approach and almost all patients underwent TAVI under general anesthesia. This is quite different from current TAVI practice and this could not applicable to current TAVI practice. Finally, follow-up was commenced at different time points in the 2 registries (TAVI group: the day of TAVI, and conservative group: the day of index echocardiography). Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding those patients who died within 30 days after entry in the conservative group, demonstrating results that are fully consistent with those in the main analysis.</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This is a nice study combining two prospective registries. The study is providing new and valuable data.</p>
<p>The references are perhaps missing European registries&#8217;data.</p>
<p>The paper is nicely written and very informative, the discussion is really nice and the figures are clean.</p>
<p>Perhaps the text is a bit too long? It could be shorten to provide more data on subgroups with figures.</p>
<p>It appears that the study is not including patients with any low gradient, low flow AS? That is a pity and adding a specific analysis on this group of patients could be even more original and valuable as no strong data are available yet.</p>
<p>The EF is looked according to cut-off of 40 and 50% but the recent literature is underscoring the difference between 60 or 55% versus below: could the authors provide these data and the Kaplan Meier curves according to EF above of below 55% when the patients are treated or not?</p>
<p>The COPD is strikingly different between groups: comments.</p>
<p>The ischemic heart disease: comments?</p>
<p>Is it expected to have such a low rate of AF in such elderly patients? This is strikingly different for USA and Europe.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: General comments:</p>
<p>In this observational retrospective study authors aimed at comparing TAVI to medical treatment using historical cohort data. The study is not timely since the question asked has been previously answered in much more robust studies. However, it could still be interesting regarding the long-term differences between the two groups. But authors should provide a more robust methodological and statistical approach and would benefit from simplification (the sensitivity and subgroup analyses provide little new insight).</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>&#8226; Not a timely study, as attested by the use of Sapien XT valves, 37% of alternative access, with probably transapical as first alternative (Results page 22 &#8220;trans-femoral approach was selected only in 63% of patients&#8221;) with a comparator based on a historical pre-TAVI era cohort. Must be clearly stated that comparison is not applicable to current clinical practice</p>
<p>&#8226; Method page 15 &#8220;We also excluded those patients &#8230; might also be contraindicated for TAVI&#8221; Authors should clarify what patients were excluded here and reformulate this statement because TAVI is a clear indication for a large proportion of patients which are contraindicated to SAVR. Please also clarify the flow chart figure 1 with regard to the box &#8220;conservative group with formal indication of AVR &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8226; Statistical analysis page 17 &#8220;Because some variables were not well balanced &#8230; further adjustment by using the Cox proportional hazard models&#8221; In case of PS matching failure please consider removing PS matching step and apply multivariable Cox upfront.</p>
<p>&#8226; Statistical analysis &#8220;We also performed subgroup analyses in terms of age, sex, STS score, LVEF, and high/low gradient AS in the propensity-score matched cohort&#8221; As reported by authors, the PS matching failed, therefore building subgroups for this cohort is likely to provide biased results.</p>
<p>&#8226; Please consider separating all-cause mortality and HR rehospitalization all over the manuscript. Those 2 outcomes have little in common and the database is likely able to provide these data.</p>
<p>&#8226; Please provide information regarding TAVI procedural characteristics in a Table: valves used, labels/generations, pathways, TEE use, general versus local anaesthesia, complications, etc</p>

<p>The paper is nicely written and very informative, the discussion is really nice and the figures are clean. </p>
<p>We appreciate your comment. As we mentioned in text, to evaluate the clinical benefit of TAVI compared with conservative therapy have been still important for clinical decision. Not only randomized control trials but also real-world data was important regarding about this problem. </p>
<p>We added the following description and reference from European registries&#8217; reference in the Discussion section.</p>

<p>#2.Perhaps the text is a bit too long? It could be shorten to provide more data on subgroups with figures.</p>
<p>Thank you for your comment. In my text, we described introduction, materials and methods, results and discussion. We described details of the materials and methods because of this complex methodology, and both results and discussion had important message in our study.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in subgroup analysis, we only wanted to demonstrate consistency about primary outcomes, and we did not aim to obtain new finding from subgroup analysis.</p>
<p>#3.It appears that the study is not including patients with any low gradient, low flow AS? That is a pity and adding a specific analysis on this group of patients could be even more original and valuable as no strong data are available yet.</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comment. In this study, we also included patients with low gradient AS. However, we did not have data of stroke volume , so we could not identify patients with low flow, low gradient severe AS. </p>
<p>#4.The EF is looked according to cut-off of 40 and 50% but the recent literature is underscoring the difference between 60 or 55% versus below: could the authors provide these data and the Kaplan Meier curves according to EF above of below 55% when the patients are treated or not?.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your valuable suggestion. Cut-off of 40 and 50% were used in prior our study and we adopted the same value. These days, in the field of heart failure, heart failure with mid- range ejection fraction was hot topic and this was defined as EF 40-49%. We set also heart failure hospitalization as one of primary endpoint in this study. Regarding this point, our group consider that the cut-off point 40 and 50 were reasonable. However, for post-hoc analysis, we conducted Kaplan Meier curves according to EF above or below 55% and cumulative incidence and adjusted hazard ratio divided by EF 55 and 60% in "Response to reviewer file" added on the end of "revised file". </p>
<p>The results of both cut-off points were consistent with cut-off of 50%.</p>
<p>#5.The COPD is strikingly different between groups: comments..</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments.</p>
<p>As you pointed out, much more patients had chronic lung disease in the TAVI group than in the conservative group. We consider this was because TAVI procedure in this study was at the early experience after introduction of TAVI in Japan. In this era, Japanese physicians selected TAVI when patients have high risk of surgical aortic valve replacement because of comorbidities like chronic lung disease. This is proof that 29.5% of the patients who underwent TAVI had moderate and severe COPD in Japanese National TAVI registry [1]. However, after propensity score matched cohort, the difference of rate of moderate or severe chronic lung disease was set off.</p>
<p>#6.The ischemic heart disease: comments?</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments.</p>
<p>As you pointed out, patients in the TAVI group had more coronary artery disease than in the conservative group. We consider this is because before TAVI procedure, cardiologist in Japan usually underwent coronary angiography, therefore coronary artery disease more tended to detect. However, after propensity score matched cohort, the difference of rate of coronary artery disease was set off.</p>
<p>#7.Is it expected to have such a low rate of AF in such elderly patients? This is strikingly different for USA and Europe.</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments.</p>
<p>In studies of USA and Europe country regarding TAVI procedure, the prevalence of AF in patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI was about 40%, and this is strikingly different for our data. There was a study that prevalence of atrial fibrillation in the general population of Japan was lower than USA [2]. In addition, another TAVI registry in Japan showed that only 20% of the patients who underwent TAVI had atrial fibrillation [3]. We consider that the prevalence of AF was lower than US data even in such elderly patients.</p>

<p>&lt;Response to the comments of the reviewer #2&gt;</p>
<p>Reviewer #2:</p>
<p>In this observational retrospective study authors aimed at comparing TAVI to medical treatment using historical cohort data. The study is not timely since the question asked has been previously answered in much more robust studies. However, it could still be interesting regarding the long-term differences between the two groups. But authors should provide a more robust methodological and statistical approach and would benefit from simplification (the sensitivity and subgroup analyses provide little new insight).</p>
<p>#1.Not a timely study, as attested by the use of Sapien XT valves, 37% of alternative access, with probably transapical as first alternative (Results page 22 &#8220;trans-femoral approach was selected only in 63% of patients&#8221;) with a comparator based on a historical pre-TAVI era cohort. Must be clearly stated that comparison is not applicable to current clinical practice</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your valuable suggestion. As you pointed out, this study compared TAVI with early experience in Japan and conservative therapy in before introduction TAVI. About 37% of patients who underwent TAVI were selected alternative approach and almost all patients were undergone TAVI under general anesthesia. This is not applicable to current TAVI practice ,although we consider that the data of early experience was important to evaluate long-term results over 2 years. </p>
<p>We added the following statement regarding the difference from current clinical practice in the limitations section.</p>
<p>Limitations (Page 21, Line 9 to Page 21, Line 12)</p>
<p>Fifth, patients who underwent TAVI were early experience data in Japan, therefore about 37% of patients were selected alternative approach and almost all patients underwent TAVI under general anesthesia. This is quite different from current TAVI practice and this could not applicable to current TAVI practice.</p>
<p>#2.Method page 15 &#8220;We also excluded those patients &#8230; might also be contraindicated for TAVI&#8221; Authors should clarify what patients were excluded here and reformulate this statement because TAVI is a clear indication for a large proportion of patients which are contraindicated to SAVR. Please also clarify the flow chart figure 1 with regard to the box &#8220;conservative group with formal indication of AVR &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We excluded patients who were considered to be contraindicated aortic valve replacement (TAVI or SAVR) because of malnutrition, muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, and expected poor prognosis due to morbidities other than heart disease.</p>
<p>For detail, 146 patients excluded contraindicated because of malnutrition (61 patients) , muscle weakness (26 patients), cognitive impairment (101 patients), and 46 patients excluded because of expected poor prognosis due to morbidities other than heart disease.</p>
<p>We added this details of exclusion you suggested to method, and modified Fig 1  in "Response to reviewer file" added on the end of "revised file".</p>
<p>Materials and Methods (Page 8, Line 10 to Page 8, Line 12)</p>
<p>We also excluded those patients who were regarded as contraindicated for SAVR by the attending physicians (malnutrition, muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, and expected poor prognosis), because these patients were considered to be contraindicated for TAVI.</p>
<p>The detail of &#8220;conservative group with formal indication of AVR&#8221; was written below in the same box in Figure 1.</p>
<p>The formal indication of AVR were symptomatic patients, asymptomatic patients with Vmax&gt;=5m/, or asymptomatic patient with LVEF&lt;50% mentioned in AHA/ACC Guideline [1].</p>
<p>We clearly described as below.</p>
<p>Materials and Methods (Page 8, Line 6 to Page 8, Line 9)</p>
<p>we excluded those patients on hemodialysis (HD) in whom TAVI has not been yet approved in Japan, and those asymptomatic patients with Vmax &lt;5m/s and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;=50%, who are regarded as candidates for watchful waiting according to the guidelines</p>
<p>#3.Statistical analysis page 17 &#8220;Because some variables were not well balanced &#8230; further adjustment by using the Cox proportional hazard models&#8221; In case of PS matching failure please consider removing PS matching step and apply multivariable Cox upfront. </p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. </p>
<p>In this study, we combined two different studies and the difference of baseline characteristics between two groups was significant. Regarding this problem, we discussed with statistician and decided to use PS matching. The statistical method of using cox proportional hazard model with residual variables to adjust after PS matching have been conducted in prior studies [2][3][4].</p>
<p>To confirm robustness of PS matching method, we also conducted cox proportional hazard models as sensitivity analysis, and the results were consistent with PS matching.</p>
<p>#4.Statistical analysis &#8220;We also performed subgroup analyses in terms of age, sex, STS score, LVEF, and high/low gradient AS in the propensity-score matched cohort&#8221; As reported by authors, the PS matching failed, therefore building subgroups for this cohort is likely to provide biased results.</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. </p>
<p>To adjust residual confounders, we also conducted cox proportional hazard model after PS matching for subgroup analyses. As you pointed out, there were not new finding in subgroup analysis. Our aim to conduct subgroup analysis was to confirm consistency of results about primary outcomes.</p>
<p>#5 Please consider separating all-cause mortality and HR rehospitalization all over the manuscript. Those 2 outcomes have little in common and the database is likely able to provide these data.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. In the study, primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, but these were not composite endpoint. In our study, these two outcomes described respectively.</p>
<p>#6.Please provide information regarding TAVI procedural characteristics in a Table: valves used, labels/generations, pathways, TEE use, general versus local anaesthesia, complications, etc</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your comment. We described TAVI procedural characteristics in S2 Table below. We show reference table in "Response to reviewer file" added on the end of "revised file".</p>
<p>We described approach site, procedure time, valve size, type of anesthesia, ECMO and complications. However, we did not have data about TEE use.</p>
