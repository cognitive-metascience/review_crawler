<abstract>
<p><italic>Volvox rousseletii</italic> is a dioecious species belonging to <italic>Volvox</italic> sect. <italic>Volvox</italic> that has previously only been found in Africa. During field surveys in a large dam lake (Lake Sagami) in Kanagawa Prefecture, central Japan, we encountered a <italic>Volvox</italic> sect. <italic>Volvox</italic> species that produces dioecious sexual spheroids in the water column. Although sexual induction of this species in culture did not produce adequately well-developed sexual spheroids for species identification, molecular data directly obtained from field-collected sexual spheroids verified the identity of field-collected male and female sexual spheroids as well as cultured materials. Based on molecular and morphological data, the species was identified as <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic>. This is the first record of a dioecious species of <italic>Volvox</italic> sect. <italic>Volvox</italic> in Japan.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Volvox</italic> sect. <italic>Volvox</italic> is a morphologically interesting group of green algae due to the presence of thick cytoplasmic bridges between constitutive cells and spines on the zygote walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref002">2</xref>]. This section of <italic>Volvox</italic> includes seven monoecious and three dioecious species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref003">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref005">5</xref>]. Although three of the monoecious species, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>globator</italic>, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>barberi</italic>, and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>capensis</italic>, are found on at least two different continents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref004">4</xref>], records of the dioecious species of this section are not as frequent, and each has previously only been found in a small area of a single continent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref006">6</xref>]. The three dioecious species are distinguished from one another primarily by differences in the morphology of the sexual spheroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref005">5</xref>]. In Japan, at least two monoecious species of <italic>Volvox</italic> sect. <italic>Volvox</italic> have been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref007">7</xref>]. However, dioecious species of this section have not previously been recorded from Japan.</p>
<p>During our field surveys of large dam lakes in Kanagawa Prefecture, central Japan, we encountered dioecious sexual spheroids of <italic>Volvox</italic> sect. <italic>Volvox</italic> in the water column of a lake. Although a subsequent culture experiment did not produce adequately well-developed and fully mature sexual spheroids for species identification, molecular data obtained directly from the fully developed sexual spheroids collected from the lake water resolved the species identity. The species was identified as <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic>, which has previously only been reported from Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref006">6</xref>]. The morphology, phylogeny, and taxonomy of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic> are described in this report.</p>

<title>Establishment of cultures and light microscopic observations</title>
<p>Water samples were collected from Lake Sagami and storage tanks of lake water from Lake Sagami within the Tanigahara Water Purification Plant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221632.t001">Table 1</xref>). Clonal cultures of <italic>Volvox rousseletii</italic> were established from the water samples in Petri dishes (90 &#215; 20 mm), using the pipette-washing method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref008">8</xref>]. The cultures were grown in screw-cap tubes (18 &#215; 150 mm) containing 10&#8211;11 mL artificial freshwater-6 (AF-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref009">9</xref>] or AF-6/3 medium (AF-6 medium diluted with two volumes of distilled water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref004">4</xref>]) at 20&#176;C, 23&#176;C, or 25&#176;C on a 14 h light:10 h dark schedule under cool-white fluorescent lamps at an intensity of 80&#8211;130 &#956;mol&#8729;m<sup>&#8211;2</sup>&#8729;s<sup>&#8211;1</sup>. Because the asexual spheroids of the dioecious species were indistinguishable from those of the monoecious species <italic>Volvox</italic> sp. Sagami in the same lake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref007">7</xref>], clonal culture strains of the candidate dioecious species of <italic>Volvox</italic> sect. <italic>Volvox</italic> (<italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic>) were selected from the aforementioned established strains based on molecular information (see below). The new wild strains of the dioecious species <italic>Volvox rousseletii</italic> from Japan (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221632.t001">Table 1</xref>) are available from the Microbial Culture Collection at the Institute for National Environmental Studies (NIES Collection, Tsukuba, Japan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref010">10</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://mcc.nies.go.jp/index_en.html" ns0:type="simple">http://mcc.nies.go.jp/index_en.html</ext-link>) as NIES-4336&#8211;NIES-4342 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221632.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To observe the morphology of asexual spheroids, the cultures were grown in <italic>Volvox</italic> thiamin acetate (VTAC) medium containing 200 mg L<sup>&#8211;1</sup> sodium acetate 4H<sub>2</sub>O [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref011">11</xref>] or VTAC/3 (VTAC medium diluted with two volumes of distilled water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref002">2</xref>]) at 25&#176;C on 14:10 LD. A small aliquot of asexual spheroids in actively grown 2- to 5-day-old cultures in tubes or Petri dishes (55 &#215; 15 mm) was examined. Sexual spheroids did not develop spontaneously in culture with either VTAC or VTAC/3 medium. To induce production of sexual spheroids in culture, urea soil <italic>Volvox</italic> thiamin/3 (USVT/3) medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref007">7</xref>] (USVT medium [VTAC medium supplemented with 40 mg L<sup>&#8211;1</sup> urea and 40 mL L<sup>&#8211;1</sup> soil extract medium] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref004">4</xref>] diluted with two volumes of distilled water) was also used, and these cultures were grown at 25&#176;C on 14:10 LD. To enhance sexual induction, 0.1&#8211;0.2 mL inducer (supernatant of the male culture after production of male sexual spheroids and sperm packets) was added to the USVT/3 medium and grown at 32&#176;C on 14:10 LD. For maturation of sexual spheroids, 0.5&#8211;1.0 mL actively growing culture with sexual spheroids was inoculated into 10&#8211;11 mL USVT/3 medium.</p>
<p>Light microscopy was performed using a BX60 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with Nomarski optics. The number of cells in spheroids was counted as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref011">11</xref>]. Individual cellular sheaths of the gelatinous matrix of the spheroids were examined after mixing approximately 10 &#956;L cultured material with 2&#8211;5 &#956;L 0.002% (w/v in distilled water) methylene blue (1B-429 WALDECK GmbH &amp; Co Division Chroma, M&#252;nster, Germany).</p>

<title>Molecular experiments</title>
<p>To identify species and infer the phylogenetic position of the Japanese dioecious species, we used the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA; ITS-1, 5.8S rDNA, and ITS-2). The ITS rDNA sequences of cultured materials and field-collected sexual spheroids as well as two chloroplast genes (the large subunit of Rubisco [<italic>rbcL</italic>] and the photosystem II CP43 apoprotein [<italic>psbC</italic>] genes) of cultured materials were determined by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref007">7</xref>] except for DNA template and enzyme reaction for PCR. For field-collected sexual spheroids, five morphologically identical male or female spheroids were washed with culture medium and pipetted into a tube into which 30 &#956;L 2&#215;PCR Buffer of KOD FX Neo (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and one ceramic bead (5 mm in diameter; YTZ ball, Nikkato Co., Osaka, Japan) were added. For clonal cultures, approximately 30 &#956;L concentrated cultured material were mixed with 30 &#956;L 2&#215;PCR Buffer and a bead. Then the tubes were subjected to a Retsch Mixer Mill MM300 (F. Kurt Retsch GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Haan, RP, Germany) with 30 Hz for 10 min to produce &#8220;disrupted cell solution&#8221; for template DNA for PCR. PCR reaction mixtures were prepared with the disrupted cell solution (10&#8211;15% v/v in the mixture) and KOD FX Neo (for ITS rDNA and <italic>rbcL</italic>) or KOD One PCR Master Mix (Toyobo) (for <italic>psbC</italic>), according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol. The PCR schedule for <italic>rbcL</italic> and <italic>psbC</italic> was 2 min at 94&#176;C, followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 98&#176;C, 30 s at 50&#176;C and 30 s at 68&#176;C. For PCR of ITS rDNA, the schedule was 2 min at 94&#176;C, followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 98&#176;C, 30 s at 66&#176;C and 30 s at 68&#176;C.</p>
<p>For the phylogeny of ITS rDNA and <italic>rbcL-psbC</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref007">7</xref>], we analyzed the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or species/samples/strains listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221632.t001">Table 1</xref>. The sequences were aligned as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref007">7</xref>].

Designation of the root or outgroup was performed as in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref007">7</xref>]. Maximum-likelihood (ML) analyses based on the ITS rDNA and <italic>rbcL-psbC</italic> alignments were performed using MEGA6.06 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref012">12</xref>], with 1000 replicates of bootstrap analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref013">13</xref>], In addition, Bayesian phylogenetic analyses for the respective alignments were carried out using MrBayes 3.2.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref014">14</xref>], as described in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref003">3</xref>].

Somatic cells in the anterior region of the spheroid were pear-shaped to ovoid in side view, with the cell length longer than cell width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221632.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Each somatic cell had two flagella, a single stigma, and a cup-shaped chloroplast with a single basal pyrenoid. Asexual spheroids typically had 4&#8211;8 gonidia. Gonidia were spherical in shape and distributed in the posterior two-thirds of the spheroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221632.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). During daughter spheroid formation, gonidia of the next generation were evident in the embryo just after inversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221632.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

However, the cultured materials in the present study did not produce adequately well-developed sexual spheroids for species identification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221632.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Thus, taxonomic data were obtained from the field-collected samples including male and female spheroids and mature zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221632.g002">Fig 2</xref>); these samples were identified as the same species as the cultured materials using ITS sequences. Two species of <italic>Volvox</italic> sect. <italic>Volvox</italic> (monoecious <italic>Volvox</italic> sp. Sagami and dioecious <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic>) generally grow simultaneously in Lake Sagami, and the asexual spheroids of the two species cannot be morphologically distinguished. Thus, morphological data for asexual spheroids of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic> described here were based on cultured materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221632.g001">Fig 1</xref>) after molecular identification.</p>
<p>The present morphological data from the Japanese dioecious species of <italic>Volvox rousseletii</italic> are consistent with those from sexual spheroids and zygotes of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic> from Africa, in that they exhibit continuous development of sperm packets during the maturation of male spheroids, the nearly simultaneous maturation of eggs in female spheroids, and acute spines in the zygote wall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221632.s003">S1 Table</xref>). Although <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic> var. <italic>lucknowensis</italic> was described based on Indian material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref016">16</xref>], spines of the zygote wall of this alga are broadly conical, representing a different species. In another dioecious species of this section, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>perglobator</italic> recorded only from the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref005">5</xref>], sperm packet development in male spheroids is not continuous (old male spheroids contain only matured sperm packets), and spines of the zygotes are blunt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221632.s003">S1 Table</xref>). The remaining dioecious species of this section, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>prolificus</italic>, has only been recorded from India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref016">16</xref>]. In <italic>V</italic>. <italic>prolificus</italic>, eggs mature continuously from young to old stages of the parental female spheroid, and spines of the zygote walls are not acute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref016">16</xref>]. In addition, the present Japanese species was most closely related to <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic> from South Africa in our phylogenetic analyses.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present combined data set from field-collected and cultured materials of a <italic>Volvox</italic> species distributed in a Japanese lake demonstrated the occurrence of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic>, which has previously only been reported from Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221632.ref006">6</xref>]. However, asexual and sexual spheroids of this Japanese alga are smaller than those of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic> reported from Africa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221632.s003">S1 Table</xref>). In addition, the Japanese alga is genetically different from the South African alga of the same species (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221632.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221632.g005">5</xref>). Thus, the species range for <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic> has been expanded based on the present study and more data are needed to resolve the biogeographical significance of the morphological and genetic variability within this species. Now, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>rousseletii</italic> is a unique dioecious species of <italic>Volvox</italic> sect. <italic>Volvox</italic> distributed in more than one continent, and fresh cultures of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>tousseletii</italic> originating from Japan and South Africa are available (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221632.t001">Table 1</xref>). Additional dioecious species of <italic>Volvox</italic> sect. <italic>Volvox</italic> with intercontinental distribution and/or new species of this section may be revealed in further studies using both field-collected and cultured materials of this section growing in various freshwater habitats worldwide.</p>

<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Nozaki,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>I agree with Reviewer 1 about the high quality and overall suitability of this manuscript for publication.&#160; In your revision and rebuttal please respond to the critiques of Reviewer 1 with whom I also agree regarding the last section where the discussion of Spirogyra and Chloromonas seemed out of place, and the need for details of the KOD polymerase method to be elaborated in the Methods section.</p>
<p>One more minor point. In Fig. 1B there are asterisk symbols which are not mentioned in the legend.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Aug 30 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript details the occurrence of Volvox rousseletii in Japan, the first time this species has been recorded outside of Africa. The manuscript is well written and is both concise and clear. The data presented is micrographs of laboratory cultivated asexual colonies, field collected sexual colonies, and phylogenetic analyses deriving from both asexual and sexual colonies (confirming that the sexual colonies do indeed correspond to the associated asexual strains). Overall the analyses are appropriate, the data recording is meticulous, the micrographs are excellent, and the paper should be published.</p>
<p>I have one major comment which should be addressed before publication. While the manuscript title, Abstract, and Introduction emphasizes the characterization of a species thought to be restricted to Africa, the Conclusions section instead emphasizes the challenge of characterizing sexual isolates in culture in Spirogyra and Chloromonas, other algae not previously mentioned. The Conclusions should be revised to address the novelty of this paper, the isolation of V. rousseletii in Japan as emphasized by the title, Abstract, and Introduction. The revised species range for V. rousseletii and availability of fresh cultures is worthwhile and should be emphasized. Similarly, the usage of KOD polymerase, an important methodological detail, should be moved to the Methods.</p>
<p>A few minor comments:</p>
<p>1. Hanschen et al 2018 Evol Eco Res published the psbC and rbcL sequences of Volvox perglobator (accession numbers KY489659 and KY489662), these should be included in Figure 5.</p>
<p>2. Page 5, last paragraph &#8220;Volvox&#8221; should be italicized when introducing VTAC media</p>
<p>3. The implementation of maximum parsimony for phylogenetic analyses is outdated and should be replaced by Bayesian analyses. This analysis can be implemented in MrBayes.</p>
<p>4. Page 9, please do not abbreviate CBCs.</p>
<p>5. Figure 1, the (*) and (b) are not specified in the legend for panels B and C.</p>

<p>Morphological and Molecular Identification of the Dioecious &#8220;African Species&#8221; Volvox rousseletii (Chlorophyceae) in the Water Column of a Japanese Lake Based on Field-collected and Cultured Materials</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Nozaki,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>I agree with Reviewer 1 about the high quality and overall suitability of this manuscript for publication.  In your revision and rebuttal please respond to the critiques of Reviewer 1 with whom I also agree regarding the last section where the discussion of Spirogyra and Chloromonas seemed out of place, and the need for details of the KOD polymerase method to be elaborated in the Methods section.</p>
<p>Responses: Based on the comments, the conclusion section has been drastically revised by deleting the discussion of Spirogyra and Chloromonas. Detailed methods of PCR with KOD polymerase have been described in Materials and Methods section of the revised manuscript. </p>
<p>One more minor point. In Fig. 1B there are asterisk symbols which are not mentioned in the legend.</p>
<p>Response: The asterisk symbols have been specified in the legend for Fig. 1B in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Aug 30 2019 11:59PM.
