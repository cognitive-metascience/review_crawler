<abstract>
<p>Pigs are anatomically, genetically and physiologically comparable to humans and represent a natural host for influenza A virus (IAV) infections. Thus, pigs may represent a relevant biomedical model for human IAV infections. We set out to investigate the systemic as well as the local immune response in pigs upon two subsequent intranasal infections with IAV H1N1pdm09. We detected decreasing numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes after the first infection. The simultaneous increase in the frequencies of proliferating cells correlated with an increase in infiltrating leukocytes in the lung. Enhanced perforin expression in &#945;&#946; and &#947;&#948; T cells in the respiratory tract indicated a cytotoxic T cell response restricted to the route of virus entry such as the nose, the lung and the bronchoalveolar lavage. Simultaneously, increasing frequencies of CD8&#945;&#945; expressing &#945;&#946; T cells were observed rapidly after the first infection, which may have inhibited uncontrolled inflammation in the respiratory tract. Taking together, the results of this study demonstrate that experimental IAV infection in pigs mimics major characteristics of human seasonal IAV infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) infections cause low mortality but high morbidity in humans worldwide annually, while pandemics that occur at irregular intervals may have a disastrous impact on global human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref001">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref003">3</xref>]. Because newly emerging IAV were often of swine origin or arose from reassortments in the pig as mixing vessel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref004">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref007">7</xref>], pigs have increasingly been evaluated as a biomedical model for human influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref008">8</xref>]. Pigs are anatomically, physiologically and genetically similar to humans indicating a closer mimic of the situation in humans than rodent models. Studies on the immune response in pigs have long been biased by the lack of specific reagents. Especially the variety of antibodies available for the pig is still far lower to that of mice. As a result, the knowledge of the porcine immune response in general is much smaller compared to that of mice. Despite these disadvantages, pigs have decisive advantages as a model for human IAV infection: they are themselves a natural host for influenza viruses and source of new IAV pathogenic for humans. Thus, understanding the immune response of pigs upon IAV infection and protection by tailored vaccines would assist in the burden on human health by minimizing the emergence of new viruses in swine and zoonotic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref009">9</xref>]. Initially, these approaches primarily aimed at identification of antigen preparations that elicit a protective antibody response against surface glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref010">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref013">13</xref>], which are effective in controlling IAV infection. However, constant antigenic drift requires an incessant update of the vaccines to match circulating strains. Thus and by expanding the number of reagents for porcine immunological analyses, in the past two decades research increasingly focused on analysis of the immune response against conserved antigenic regions unlikely to change extensively, including cellular immunity. These studies provided evidence for the importance of the cellular immune response in eliminating IAV, also in pigs. These studies have in common that they either only investigated blood-derived cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref014">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref016">16</xref>] or analyzed the systemic and local immune response only at a very early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref017">17</xref>] or late time points of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref015">15</xref>]. The situation is further complicated by the use of different IAV strains. Recent work recorded for the first time the kinetics of T cell responses and their phenotyping, which supported the previous assumption of the induction of IAV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref019">19</xref>]. This is in line with several publications reporting IAV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in humans associated with cytolytic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref021">21</xref>] as well as memory characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref022">22</xref>]. Further, IAV-specific memory T cells were reported to reside in human lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref023">23</xref>]. Altogether, these porcine studies provided further evidence for similarities of the IAV immune response in pigs and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref025">25</xref>]. However, it is important to note that the prominent porcine populations of CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref026">26</xref>] as well as the high number of peripheral &#947;&#948; T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref027">27</xref>] cells are virtually absent in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref029">29</xref>], representing a major difference. Besides the numerical difference, the functionality of the two cell populations is comparable in both human and swine. CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive T cells are mature effector cells with memory characteristics that rapidly mount antigen-specific responses upon antigenic challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref030">30</xref>]. Besides acting as innate immune cells via pattern recognition receptors and direct killing of infected cells, &#947;&#948; T cells do play a major role in antigen processing and presentation in human and swine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref032">32</xref>]. The two most detailed characterizations of T cell dynamics in influenza-infected pigs were performed by Gerner&#8217;s group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref019">19</xref>]. They reported increased capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8&#945;<sup>+</sup> T cells to co-produce IFN-&#947;, TNF-&#945; and IL-2 as well as the appearance of blood-derived IAV-specific CD8&#946;<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref018">18</xref>]. Further investigations revealed increased frequencies of IFN-&#947; and/or TNF-&#945; producing, influenza-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs of infected pigs, resulting in an accumulation of memory cells in the lungs at 6 weeks post infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref019">19</xref>]. Although these porcine IAV studies report a pronounced involvement of the cellular immune response, a global analysis and comparison of immune cells and their functions along the route of entry (nose, lung and lung lymph node) as well as the systemic responses (blood) after infection with H1N1pdm09 were still missing. To ascertain the value of the pig as a reliable model mimicking human IAV infection, we compared the immune response in pigs after a natural IAV infection without inducing major clinical signs, as usually occurs in seasonal human influenza.</p>

<p>All animal experiments were approved by the State Office for Agriculture, Food Safety and Fishery in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (LALFF M-V) with reference numbers 7221.3-1-035/17.</p>
<p>In total 29 four-week old German landrace pigs were obtained from a commercial high health status herd (BHZP-Basiszuchtbetrieb Garlitz-Langenheide, Germany). This farm is free from the following diseases or pathogens: Pseudorabies, classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), <italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Mycoplasma hypopneumoniae</italic>, ascaris, mange, <italic>Brachyspira hyodysenteriae</italic> and salmonella category I. Vaccination program does not include vaccination against influenza viruses but the following vaccines were administered: Sows were vaccinated against porcine circovirus type 2 (once), <italic>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae</italic>/Porcine parvovirus (twice), salmonella (twice) and <italic>Haemophilus parasuis</italic> (twice). Piglets were vaccinated against PCV2 once and <italic>Mycoplasma hypopneumoniae</italic> twice. Piglets for this study were kept under BSL2 conditions in the animal facilities of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Riems. IAV infections were performed twice during study period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222943.t001">Table 1</xref>), whereby first infection occurred three weeks after transport to our facility by intranasal administration of 2 ml virus suspension (10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) using mucosal atomization devices (MAD) (Wolfe Tory Medical, USA) with 26 animals. A second infection was performed on day 21 after the first infection. Three animals were mock infected with medium only and served as controls. Blood samples from the same six randomly selected animals were taken on day 0, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21 (prior to second infection), 22, 25 and 31 after first infection for kinetics of blood cells. After euthanasia with Release&#174; (IDT, Germany), necropsy was performed on five animals on day 4, 7, 21 and 25 post first infection. Control animals were euthanized on day 30 after first mock-infection.</p>

<title>Virus</title>
<p>Influenza virus A/Bayern/74/2009 (hereafter referred to as H1N1pdm09) was propagated on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCKII) in MEM supplemented with 0.56% bovine serum albumin, 100 U/ml Penicillin, 100 &#956;g/ml Streptomycin and 2 &#956;g/ml L-1-Tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). For viral titration by TCID<sub>50</sub> assay, serial ten-fold dilutions of virus suspensions were prepared, added to MDCKII cells in 96-well plates, and incubated for three days at 37&#176;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cytopathic effect was examined microscopically. Titers were calculated according to Spearman-K&#228;rber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref034">34</xref>].

<title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>Necropsy and pathological gross examination was performed according to standard guidelines under BSL3** conditions. For extracorporeal bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), the left main bronchus was cut with sterile scissors and 200 ml of sterile PBS solution was injected with a syringe through the main bronchus into the left lung lobe, which was then kneaded softly. BAL fluid was recovered by syringe.</p>
<p>For flow cytometric analyses organ samples from the following organs were taken during necropsy and stored in ice-cold PBS until further use: mucosa of nasal cavity, lung tissue (<italic>lobus dexter medius</italic>) and lung lymph node (<italic>nodi lymphatici tracheobronchiales inferiores</italic>).</p>
<p>Specimen from the following organs were collected for histopathology and fixed in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde: nasal cavity with conchae, trachea, lungs (<italic>lobus sinister cranialis pars cranialis and caudalis</italic>, <italic>lobus sinister caudalis</italic>, <italic>lobus dexter cranialis</italic>, <italic>lobus dexter medius</italic>, <italic>lobus dexter accessorius</italic>, <italic>lobus dexter caudalis</italic>), lymph node from the lymphocentrum bronchiale.</p>
<p>Lungs were scored for macroscopically detectable atelectasis (reddish-tan, consolidated, lobular to lobar parenchyma) and scored as follows: (shown as percentage of the total parenchyma analyzed for each pulmonary lobe): 0 = no atelectasis, 1 = mild atelectasis (0&#8211;30%), 2 = moderate atelectasis (30&#8211;60%), 3 = severe atelectasis (60&#8211;100%). The max atelectasis score of all seven scored pulmonary lobes was taken to set up one gross lesion score for each individual pig. For histopathological examination, formaldehyde-fixed tissue samples were embedded in paraffin and cut at 3&#956;m. The sections were mounted on Super-Frost-Plus-Slides (Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for light microscopical examination using a Zeiss Axio Scope.A1 microscope equipped with 5x, 10x, 20x, and 40x N-ACHROPLAN objectives (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). All tissue sections were scored blind and investigated for signs and severity levels of inflammation (rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchointerstial pneumonia) as follows: 0 = no inflammation, 1 = mild inflammation, 2 = moderate inflammation, 3 = severe inflammation. The final score for each organ of an individual animal was raised on the basis of the max value of the respective scores.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect Influenza A virus antigen in paraffin embedded tissue sections using a mouse monoclonal antibody against the matrixprotein of influenza A virus (M21C64R3, ATCC, Manassas, VA) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref036">36</xref>]. Briefly, tissue sections were dewaxed and rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 10 min. After demasking of antigens with 10mM Na-citrate buffer (pH = 6, 700 W) for 20 min in a microwave oven, sections were incubated with undiluted normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature to block nonspecific binding sites. Thereafter, section were incubated with anti-Influenza A matrix protein antibodies, diluted 1: 200 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at 4&#176;C overnight. This incubation was followed by a biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, LINARIS biologische Produkte, Dossenheim, Germany) and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min each at room temperature. Positive antigen-antibody reactions were visualized by incubation with AEC-substrate (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) for 10 min. Sections were washed with deionized water and counterstained with Mayer`s hemalaun for 30 s. Sections that stained positive for IAV matrix protein were investigated for cell-specific viral antigen localization and scored for viral antigen distribution in each inspected organ: 0 = negative, 1 = focal to oligofocal, 2 = multifocal, 3 = diffuse as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref037">37</xref>]. For each organ the max values of all scores were taken into analysis.</p>

<title>Cell preparation and antibody staining for flow cytometric analysis</title>
<p>Whole blood was diluted with PBS 1:10 and overall number of white blood cells and different leukocyte subpopulations were determined by blood counting device. Flow cytometric analysis of single cell suspensions from mucosa of nasal cavity, BAL, lung tissue and lung lymph node were performed. Cell from BAL fluid were enriched by centrifugation and discarding the supernatant. Leukocytes from mucosa of nasal cavity, lung lymph node and spleen were prepared by mechanical disruption on metal sieves with plungers and washed with PBS. For isolation of leukocytes from the lung, tissue was minced with scissors, resuspended in PBS-EDTA supplemented with 100 &#956;M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and digested with Collagenase D (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 40 min at 37&#176;C. After pressing the digested tissue gently through a cell strainer with a plunger, remaining tissue was removed by short centrifugation.</p>
<p>Cell pellets were suspended in FACS buffer for flow cytometric antibody staining. Antibodies used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222943.s001">S1 Table</xref>. Unless otherwise stated, all incubation steps were carried out at 4 &#176;C in the dark for 15 min in case of extracellular staining and for 30 min for intracellular staining. Staining of whole blood required erythrocyte lysis after surface staining by conventional lysis buffer (1.55 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 100 mM KHCO<sub>3</sub>, 12.7 mM Na<sub>4</sub>EDTA, pH 7.4, in A. dest.).

<p>Inflammatory changes were detected in the nasal mucosa, trachea and lung. Results from histopathological investigations of nasal mucosa and lungs are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Starting at 4 dpi pigs showed mild, focal, necrotizing rhinitis with loss of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g002">Fig 2</xref> left panel) and IAV matrix protein-positive respiratory epithelial cells within the lesions. Mild, focal, subacute, lymphohistiocytic rhinitis have been observed 7, 21 and 25 dpi. Until 25 dpi inflammation decreased constantly whereas control pigs were free of rhinitis. One infected pig showed mild, necrotizing tracheitis at 4 dpi compared to all other infected and control pigs, which lacked similar lesions. Lung lesions were mainly localized in bronchi, bronchioles and bronchioloalveolar transition zone leading to mild bronchiolointerstitial pneumonia as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g002">Fig 2</xref> (right panel). 4 dpi, mild necrosis and loss of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium was evident in H1N1pdm09 inoculated pigs followed by the infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages and few neutrophils into the affected tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, right panel). At 7 dpi, mild alveolar edema was present whereas necrosis extended to the bronchi-alveolar transition zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, right panel). At that time, lymphocytes and macrophages increasingly infiltrated the pulmonary interstitium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, right panel), but Influenza A matrix protein was not detectable at any time point later than 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g002">Fig 2B, 2D, 2F, 2H and 2J</xref>, right panel). 21 dpi, inflammatory cells were still evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g002">Fig 2G</xref>, right panel). Still negative for viral antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g002">Fig 2J</xref>, right panel), the amount of infiltrating inflammatory cells slightly decreased at 25 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g002">Fig 2I</xref>, right panel).

From day 25 (4 days after second infection) increasing frequencies of double-positive Th cells were detected with further decreasing na&#239;ve cells. Frequency of proliferating CD8<sup>+</sup> cells&#8211;characterized by Ki-67 expression&#8211;increased both after first and to a lesser extent after second infection with H1N1pdm09.

<p>Differentiation in subtypes expressing either CD8&#945;&#945; homo- or CD8&#945;&#946; heterodimers revealed that under physiological conditions (control) CD8<sup>+</sup> &#945;&#946; T cells from tissues of the respiratory tract&#8211;nose, BAL and lung&#8211;are mainly composed of cells expressing the CD8&#945;&#945; homodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). In contrast, in the lymph node CD8&#945;&#946; expressing T cells were the predominant population. After an initial slight drop in nose and BAL four days after first infection, CD8&#945;&#945; expressing cells increased until day seven in all organs, whereby the ratio in the lymph node was completely reversed towards the homodimer expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. On day 21, prior to second infection, ratio of CD8&#945;&#945; to CD8&#945;&#946; expressing cells was the same as for control animals. Four days after second infection, the previously observed ratio shift was repeated and resembled the ratio on day seven except for cells in the lung lymph node, for which the ratio was the same as on day four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222943.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using two different approaches, continuous peripheral blood cell analysis from the same animals as well as analysis of organ samples from the respiratory tract at specific time points after infection, we characterized in detail the kinetics of the porcine immune response after intranasal infection with H1N1pdm09. In contrast to previous studies reporting fever as well as clinical sings after intranasal infection of pigs with IAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref039">39</xref>], pigs in our study did not develop either. Since different virus strains as well as doses were used, this finding was not unexpected. While a study by Pomorska-M&#243;l <italic>et al</italic>. reported mild clinical signs without fever in intranasally H1N1-infected pigs they neither observed significant changes in hematological parameters nor in numbers of subsets of T and B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref040">40</xref>]. However, the decreasing lymphocyte count caused by decreasing numbers of T cells and B cells within the first week after infection, correlated well with the other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref041">41</xref>]. Khatri <italic>et al</italic>. detected also increasing frequencies of CD8<sup>+</sup> &#945;&#946; as well as &#947;&#948; T cells in lungs and lung LN of H1N1-infected pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref017">17</xref>], which is in line with our findings. We could further show that this also holds true at the site of first contact, the nose. Increased numbers correlated with an increased amount of perforin pointing toward enhanced cytotoxic function. An increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs, which was reported by two groups that observed high fever and strong clinical signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref017">17</xref>], was not observed in our study.</p>
<p>The overall leukocyte count was only slightly decreased on day two after the first infection, which was mainly due to a decrease of the neutrophil population and to a lesser extent to decreasing numbers of &#945;&#946; T cells and B cells. Two days later, absolute numbers of WBC were restored to normal levels because of elevated numbers of myeloid cells&#8211;monocytes, dendritic cells and neutrophils&#8211;whereas numbers of lymphocytes decreased further until day seven. These observations parallel the mild lymphopenia with monocytosis in human patients infected with IAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref042">42</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref044">44</xref>], which was proposed as a screening tool for influenza infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref046">46</xref>]. An increase in neutrophils of IAV patients within the first days of infection described by some groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref048">48</xref>] could not be detected in our study. However, we observed an increase in frequency of CD14 expressing cells after both infections. CD14 upregulation is associated with activation in granulocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref050">50</xref>] and serves as a coreceptor for TLR7 mediated recognition of ssRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref051">51</xref>]. We detected a higher number of dendritic cells in the blood in infected pigs four days after the first infection with simultaneously increased number of monocytes, which was not reported for human patients infected with H1N1pdm09. This might be because in most of the studies characterizing the immune response in H1N1 patients definite time points are hard to determine e.g. time of the infection. In contrast, the decrease in &#945;&#946; T cells and B cells in pigs covers a period of four to seven days with recovery until day 14 and is comparable with decreasing frequencies in patients infected with H1N1pdm09 although the period of mild lymphopenia varies between studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref052">52</xref>]. However, after the second infection, recovery was faster compared to the first infection and thus comparable to vaccinated humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref054">54</xref>]. Further, we detected an increased proliferative activity in CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (constituting of cytotoxic and memory cells) and cytotoxic (CD8<sup>+</sup>) subtypes of &#945;&#946; T cells, which was pronounced after first infection with a lesser increase after second infection resembling a memory response. These observations are in line with the findings in an experimental human influenza experiment that additionally reported those CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to have cytolytic and thus direct antiviral characteristics like perforin expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref056">56</xref>]. Description of prominent CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses being strong in numbers, by contrast, are primarily associated with severe influenza cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>Given that the H1N1pdm09 infection of the pigs in our setup with MAD leads to an infection that is almost exclusively localized to the respiratory tract, the increase in &#945;&#946; T cells frequencies in nose and BAL were more prominent starting as early as day 4 post infection and peaking at day 7. Interestingly, in 14 weeks old healthy pigs the ratio of CD8&#945;&#945; to CD8&#945;&#946; expressing &#945;&#946; T cells isolated from nasal mucosa, the BAL or lung tissue is shifted towards CD8&#945;&#945; cells with frequencies of 85%, 93% and 85% respectively. This is the first description of the distribution of these two subtypes in respiratory organs of pigs and is in line with finding in humans and mice investigating the role of CD8&#945;&#945; expressing cells among the intraepithelial leukocyte population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref058">58</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref060">60</xref>]. Because CD8&#945;&#945; is known to be a corepressor of TCR avidity and diminishes activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref062">62</xref>], it is tempting to speculate that infection with H1N1pdm09 leads to activation whilst upregulation of CD8&#945;&#945; inhibits at the same time an excessive immune response. In line with this, due to homeostasis, frequencies of cytolytic CD8&#945;&#946; T cells decreased further enhancing an anti-inflammatory environment. Several studies in mice and humans do further attribute CD8&#945;&#945; expressing T cells to have memory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref063">63</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref065">65</xref>]. Our findings point in the same direction, as CD8&#945;&#945; expression of &#945;&#946; T cells in the respiratory tract of pigs increased more rapidly after second infection. In control (healthy) pigs, the expression level of perforin per cell within the CD8&#945;&#945; subpopulation in respiratory tract samples is only a third of the expression level in CD8&#945;&#946; expressing T cells supporting in addition that they do not primarily have cytolytic activity. CD8&#945;&#945; expressing T cells arise mainly from CD8&#945;&#946; T cells by downregulation of the &#946;-chain and thus diminishing activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref065">65</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that the absence of perforin expression after the second infection is due to inhibition by increased frequencies of CD8&#945;&#945; T cells.</p>
<p>Because lymphocytes in the blood of pigs comprise up to 50% of &#947;&#948; T cells (~3000 cells/&#956;l blood), which strongly contrasts the maximum of 5% (&lt;500 cells/&#956;l blood) in healthy humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref066">66</xref>], it is challenging to draw conclusions with regard to comparability. Nevertheless, absolute numbers of these cells remained relatively constant throughout the study decreasing only slightly after the first infection but increasing after the second infection at the expense of &#945;&#946; T cells in the blood. The latter observation might be explained by the different time points of blood sampling: after the first infection, blood was taken at day two whereas after the second infection it was taken on the first day p.i., to gather a potential memory response. The hypothesis is supported by a pronounced increase in proliferative activity in both activated subtypes of &#947;&#948; T cells after first infection and a subsequent increase of activated &#947;&#948; T cells in the blood, supporting that this cell population serves as first line defense. The rapid decrease in frequency of proliferative cells might be explained by the recruitment to the site of inflammation (nose and lung), where their frequencies increased as early as day four after infection with a pronounced perforin expression. Frequencies of &#947;&#948; T cells in lungs of pigs are comparable to those of humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref067">67</xref>] and they are known not only to maintain pulmonary homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref068">68</xref>] but also to efficiently kill IAV infected epithelial cells and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref069">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref070">70</xref>]. In line with these findings from human <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref070">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref071">71</xref>], we observed a notable increase in perforin expression of &#947;&#948; T cells after first infection in mucosa of nasal cavity constituting an entrance for the virus. Furthermore, concurred increase in frequency of CD8 expressing &#947;&#948; T cells was observed along the route of entry from nose to lung and lung lymph node, in the latter most probably constituting antigen-presenting cells. Because perforin expression did not increase after the second infection and frequencies of &#947;&#948; T cells in blood where increased only at day 14 p.i., it is likely that these cells play a major role in recovery from influenza infections as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref029">29</xref>]. Finally, also T-bet expression in &#947;&#948; T cells increased after both infections in nose and BAL, which is associated with improved recovery from influenza infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222943.ref072">72</xref>].</p>
<p>Given that in a natural H1N1 infection in humans the day of infection is not exactly clear, it seems obvious that a day-to-day comparison of patient data with the predefined time points in this study is challenging. Further, for obvious reasons, analyses of lung or respiratory epithelial tissue from patients with mild influenza virus infections are limited. However, transiently decreased numbers of lymphocytes along with increased monocyte counts in the blood seems to be a common feature in mild human and porcine subclinical H1N1pdm09 infections. Further, we could show the presence of and increase in CD8&#945;&#945; expressing &#945;&#946; as well as CD8&#945;<sup>+</sup> &#947;&#948; T cells in mucosa from respiratory tract after infection in pigs, indicating that these cells have the same dual role as in humans. They do rapidly respond with perforin expression to H1N1pdm09 but simultaneously increase expression of the inhibitory CD8&#945;&#945; molecule to prevent excessive harmful immune responses. Therefore, even though pigs in our study did not show overt clinical signs, underlying immune and pathogenic mechanisms seem to be similar. The results from this study further expand the knowledge of the porcine immune response to pandemic IAV infection and thus, support the use of the pig as a large animal model for human seasonal influenza infections. This offers not only a model for testing the efficacy of new influenza vaccines regarding cellular immune responses but also to expand the model for further investigations of influenza induced pneumonia especially in bacto-viral coinfection scenarios.</p>

<p>Journal Requirements:</p>
<p>1. When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>2. We note that you have included the phrase &#8220;data not shown&#8221; in your manuscript. Unfortunately, this does not meet our data sharing requirements. PLOS does not permit references to inaccessible data. We require that authors provide all relevant data within the paper, Supporting Information files, or in an acceptable, public repository. Please add a citation to support this phrase or upload the data that corresponds with these findings to a stable repository (such as Figshare or Dryad) and provide and URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers that may be used to access these data. Or, if the data are not a core part of the research being presented in your study, we ask that you remove the phrase that refers to these data.</p>

<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: Yes</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: 1. Please furnish information on the pre-screen done on the pigs. This should include both qPCR and serology (ELISA) for IAV, PRRSV, PPV, PCV 2, TTV. if animals were negative prior to D0, what was their status at the end of the study?</p>
<p>2. How were the mock and challenge groups housed? could comparative counts and FACS data for mocks also be clearly identified and shown along with challenge groups?</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript by Schwaiger and colleagues describes the characterization of swine immune cell population changes following an experimental infection with a human H1N1 influenza virus. The results are of interest because swine are a natural host of influenza viruses and can also play a role in the zoonotic transmission of non-human influenza strains into the human population. In addition, (as stated by the authors), because of comparable sizes, immunity and physiology, pigs are a valuable animal model for evaluating immune responses, vaccines, antivirals, etc. In general, the manuscript is well written and provides detailed methods and results that can serve as a guide to other groups. To be fair, the authors should also point out some important differences between pigs and humans such as the much shorter &#8220;childhood&#8221; and general lifespan of pigs; important differences in immune cell populations such as the double positive CD4+CD8+ lymphocytes and strikingly different proportions of gamma-delta+ T cells in blood, or the lack of reagents and general knowledge of the pig&#8217;s immunity in comparison to other animal models (mice).</p>
<p>The authors should also consider the following specific comments:</p>
<p>Line 68. The animals were obtained from a commercial herd. If known, it would be important to state the serological status (from natural infection and from vaccination) of the mothers, since the presence of maternal antibodies against H1N1 influenza would have a strong impact in the evolution of the infection.</p>
<p>Line 73. Animals were re-infected with the same influenza strain 21 days after the first infection. In the context of modelling influenza in humans, it is not clear what was the purpose of this infection. In humans, re-infection occurs in the following influenza seasons (at least 1 year later) and by an antigenically drifted strain.</p>
<p>Line 122. &#8220;&#8230;antibody against the anti-matrixprotein&#8230;&#8221; this sentence is incorrect. It should be either &#8220;&#8230;antibody against the matrixprotein&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;&#8230;anti-matrixprotein monoclonal antibody&#8230;&#8221;. Please correct.</p>
<p>Line 128. It might be useful to describe what TBS stands for.</p>
<p>Line 149. In this paragraph there is a sentence repeated &#8220;Antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary table 1&#8221;. Please correct.</p>
<p>Line 175 and beyond. Please consider using the term &#8220;necropsy&#8221; instead of &#8220;autopsy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Line 197. I believe the panels from figure 2 are cited wrongly: panel 2I shows H&amp;E staining (infiltrating inflammatory cells) and panel 2J shows immunohistochemistry (viral antigen).</p>
<p>Line 334. &#8220;&#8230;as well as in infectious conditions&#8221; I believe it should say &#8220;&#8230;as well as in infection conditions&#8221;.</p>
<p>Line 404. This is probably a typo, &#8220;deceased&#8221; should say &#8220;decreased&#8221;</p>

<p>Reviewer #3: The manuscript by Schwaiger and colleagues described experimental H1N1pdm09 infection in pigs in order to mimic human seasonal influenza infections. The authors used 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus to intranasally infect a group of 4-week-old pigs for 21 days, then re-infected them with the same virus again to investigate systemic and local immune responses by testing blood, mucosa of nasal cavity and lung tissues bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. Result showed that decreasing numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes were detected after the first infection, the simultaneous increase in the frequencies of proliferating cells correlated with an increase in infiltrating leukocytes in the lung. Furthermore, a cytotoxic T cell response was detected but restricted to the respiratory route of virus entry such as the nose, the lung and the bronchoalveolar lavage according to detected enhanced perforin expression in &#945;&#946; and &#947;&#948; T cells in the respiratory tract. Increasing frequencies of CD8&#945;&#945; expressing &#945;&#946; T cells were also observed rapidly after the first infection, which could play a role in inhibition of uncontrolled inflammation in the respiratory tract. Authors conclude that the results from this study demonstrate that experimental influenza A virus infection in pigs mimics major characteristics of human seasonal influenza A virus infections. The manuscript is well written and provides interesting information which complements findings of former studies.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>The pigs used in the study were purchased from a commercial high health status herd. The detailed information on these pigs should be provided such as which pathogens (influenza A, D virus, PRRSV, PCV2 and mycoplasma etc) were tested prior to infection as any prior infection will impact the obtained results and further interpret.</p>
<p>In the figures 5, 6, 9 and 10, the data from only infected pigs were presented despite of the data at d0 as controls. If the pigs were infected other pathogens before, these data could not reflect the reality of only infection of 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Therefore, it is necessary to provide more detailed information on pigs</p>

<p>Reviewers' comments:</p>
<p>Reviewer #1:</p>
<p>1. Please furnish information on the pre-screen done on the pigs. This should include both qPCR and serology (ELISA) for IAV, PRRSV, PPV, PCV 2, and TTV. If animals were negative prior to d0, what was their status at the end of the study?</p>
<p>Prior to d0, pigs were tested negative for IAV genome by qPCR. During the trial, we were able to detect IAV only on day 2 and 4 after first infection in nasal swabs (see Table 1). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in sera of infected pigs only from day 14 with very low titres until the end of the study (Table 2). Control pigs did not show antibodies against H1N1. </p>

<p>We have not yet provided this information, as we do not consider it a core part of this study, which focuses on the cellular mucosal immune response. If desired, we can include viral titres and titration of neutralizing antibodies in new supplementary tables to provide additional information. </p>
<p>The farm from which the pigs were purchased is free of PRRSV, which obviates the need for re-testing by our laboratory. Furthermore, the sows were vaccinated against PPV on the 170th and 190th day of life and against PCV 2 on day 160. Because we started our study when the animals were 8 weeks old, the maternal antibodies against these viruses were probably degraded as far as possible [1]. Piglets themselves received vaccines against PCV2 and H. parasuis at their 14th day of life, which makes it likely that they already started to generate antibodies against these viruses, which we did not screen for. For the occurrence of TTV was tested neither by us nor by the farm. We included a section on pathogen status and vaccination program of the farm in Material and Methods section (lines 81-89): &#8220;This farm is free from the following diseases or pathogens: Pseudorabies, classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Mycoplasma hypopneumoniae, ascaris, mange, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and salmonella category I. Vaccination program does not include vaccination against influenza viruses but the following vaccines were administered: Sows were vaccinated against porcine circovirus type 2 (once), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae/Porcine parvovirus (twice), salmonella (twice) and Haemophilus parasuis (twice). Piglets were vaccinated against PCV2 once and Mycoplasma hypopneumoniae twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. How were the mock and challenge groups housed? </p>
<p>After arrival of the animals (4-weeks of age), the piglets were randomly separated in three groups and housed in three different sheds under BSL2 conditions. One week prior to infection (7-weeks of age) pigs were divided in six groups, with the control group held in a shed at the other end of the building. Five groups were infected one week later. Contact between the animals of different sheds was strictly avoided not only structurally but also by different hygiene interventions (showers between the sheds, disposable clothing and masks within the sheds).</p>
<p>3. Could comparative counts and FACS data for mocks also be clearly identified and shown along with challenge groups?</p>
<p>With this question, the reviewer addresses one of the central points of our study. The characteristic feature of this study is that the animals intended for organ removal (four infected groups plus control group) were only subjected to blood sample drawing on the day of necropsy. This also includes the control group whose section day coincided with the last day of the study. We deliberately chose this scheme because regular blood collection has a significant effect on the stress level of the animals and thus on the immune response. In order to avoid this effect, the same six pigs randomly selected at the beginning of the experiment were used for the blood kinetics only. Blood from control animals was only drawn at day of their euthanasia. This is why we cannot provide comparative counts and FACS data for peripheral blood leukocytes of mock animals from time points correlating with those of infected blood-donating group. From our point of view, the d0 sample of the latter animals represents the adequate control to all blood samples of these animals after infection.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Schwaiger and colleagues describes the characterization of swine immune cell population changes following an experimental infection with a human H1N1 influenza virus. The results are of interest because swine are a natural host of influenza viruses and can also play a role in the zoonotic transmission of non-human influenza strains into the human population. In addition, (as stated by the authors), because of comparable sizes, immunity and physiology, pigs are a valuable animal model for evaluating immune responses, vaccines, antivirals, etc. In general, the manuscript is well written and provides detailed methods and results that can serve as a guide to other groups.</p>
<p>1. To be fair, the authors should also point out some important differences between pigs and humans such as the much shorter &#8220;childhood&#8221; and general lifespan of pigs; important differences in immune cell populations such as the double positive CD4+CD8+ lymphocytes and strikingly different proportions of gamma-delta+ T cells in blood, or the lack of reagents and general knowledge of the pig&#8217;s immunity in comparison to other animal models (mice).</p>
<p>The reviewer is right. We have added information about drawbacks when using the pig as a model compared to the mouse model (lines 33-37 and lines 44-45): &#8220;Studies on the immune response in pigs have long been biased by the lack of specific reagents. Especially the variety of antibodies available for the pig is still far lower to that of mice. As a result, the knowledge of the porcine immune response in general is much smaller compared to that of mice. Despite these disadvantages, pigs have decisive advantages as a model for human IAV infection.&#8221;, and &#8220;[&#8230;] and by expanding the number of reagents for porcine immunological analyses, [&#8230;]&#8221;. We also included a paragraph on the major differences in peripheral blood cell composition between human and swine (lines 57-63 and references 26-32): &#8220;However, it is important to note that the prominent porcine populations of CD4+/CD8+ double positive T cells [26] as well as the high number of peripheral &#947;&#948; T [27] cells are virtually absent in humans [28, 29], representing a major difference. Besides the numerical difference, the functionality of the two cell populations is comparable in both human and swine. CD4+/CD8+ double positive T cells are mature effector cells with memory characteristics that rapidly mount antigen-specific responses upon antigenic challenge [18, 30]. Besides acting as innate immune cells via pattern recognition receptors and direct killing of infected cells, &#947;&#948; T cells do play a major role in antigen processing and presentation in human and swine [31, 32].&#8221;</p>
<p>With regard to the shorter "childhood" of pigs, we cannot agree: compared to the life span of pigs, the "childhood" is not much shorter. Especially regarding the risk and the frequency of infections of the young animals in the flat deck area, the herd veterinarians report amazing parallels to children who come to kindergarten.</p>
<p>2. The authors should also consider the following specific comments:</p>
<p>a. Line 68. The animals were obtained from a commercial herd. If known, it would be important to state the serological status (from natural infection and from vaccination) of the mothers, since the presence of maternal antibodies against H1N1 influenza would have a strong impact in the evolution of the infection.</p>
<p>The reviewer is right, that maternal antibodies have a strong impact in the evolution of infection. In our study, serological status of sows regarding antibodies directed against H1N1 viruses was not taken into account, because our study started, when pigs were 8 weeks of age. By this time, all maternal antibodies should have been largely metabolized [1].</p>
<p>b. Line 73. Animals were re-infected with the same influenza strain 21 days after the first infection. In the context of modelling influenza in humans, it is not clear what was the purpose of this infection. In humans, re-infection occurs in the following influenza seasons (at least 1 year later) and by an antigenically drifted strain.</p>
<p>The reviewer is right that re-infection in humans occurs primarily around a year later with an antigenically drifted strain in the vast majority of cases. The purpose of the re-infection in our study three weeks after first infection was to analyse a potential memory response. This re-infection was not intended to imitate the seasonal flu that occurs in humans a year later. The period of three weeks between the first and second infection in our study allows at most a comparison with the seasonal infection after vaccination in humans.</p>
<p>c. Line 122. &#8220;&#8230;antibody against the anti-matrixprotein&#8230;&#8221; this sentence is incorrect. It should be either &#8220;&#8230;antibody against the matrixprotein&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;&#8230;anti-matrixprotein monoclonal antibody&#8230;&#8221;. Please correct.</p>
<p>We corrected the sentence as follows: &#8220;&#8230;antibody against the matrixprotein of influenza A virus&#8230;&#8221; (line 139).</p>
<p>d. Line 128. It might be useful to describe what TBS stands for.</p>
<p>We added the full form &#8220;Tris-buffered saline (TBS)&#8221; in the material and methods section (line 145).</p>
<p>e. Line 149. In this paragraph there is a sentence repeated &#8220;Antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary table 1&#8221;. Please correct.</p>
<p>We have deleted one of the duplicate sentences (line 169).</p>
<p>f. Line 175 and beyond. Please consider using the term &#8220;necropsy&#8221; instead of &#8220;autopsy&#8221;.</p>
<p>We exchanged the term &#8220;autopsy&#8221; to &#8220;necropsy&#8221; throughout the document (lines 190, 221, 229, 325, 365, 392 and 520).</p>
<p>g. Line 197. I believe the panels from figure 2 are cited wrongly: panel 2I shows H&amp;E staining (infiltrating inflammatory cells) and panel 2J shows immunohistochemistry (viral antigen).</p>
<p>We fixed the wrong citation and used the correct labelling to the panels of figure 2 in the text. The new text is as follows: &#8220;Still negative for viral antigen (Fig 2J, right panel), the amount of infiltrating inflammatory cells slightly decreased at 25 dpi (Fig 2I, right panel). &#8220; (lines 212-213).</p>
<p>h. Line 334. &#8220;&#8230;as well as in infectious conditions&#8221; I believe it should say &#8220;&#8230;as well as in infection conditions&#8221;.</p>
<p>We corrected the expression &#8220;&#8230;infectious conditions&#8221;. It now reads as follows: &#8220;&#8230;infection conditions&#8221; (line 349).</p>
<p>i. Line 404. This is probably a typo, &#8220;deceased&#8221; should say &#8220;decreased&#8221;</p>
<p>We have corrected the typo. The word shall read as follows: &#8220;decreased&#8221; (line 418).</p>
<p>j. Line 423. &#8220;&#8230;reported those CD4+ T cells to have cytolytic&#8230;&#8221; please double check. Did you mean CD8+?</p>
<p>Although it may sound unusual at first, Wilkinson and colleagues showed that influenza-specific CD4+ T cells were able to kill autologous cells in a peptide specific manner [2]. This finding was later confirmed in a study performed by Zhou et al. [3]. Growing amount of evidence suggest CD4+ T cells to have direct antiviral activity and thus, to play a critical role in numerous viral infections in humans and animal models in vivo. These findings are summarized in e.g. these reviews: [4-6].</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: </p>
<p>The manuscript by Schwaiger and colleagues described experimental H1N1pdm09 infection in pigs in order to mimic human seasonal influenza infections. The authors used 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus to intranasally infect a group of 4-week-old pigs for 21 days, then re-infected them with the same virus again to investigate systemic and local immune responses by testing blood, mucosa of nasal cavity and lung tissues bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. Result showed that decreasing numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes were detected after the first infection, the simultaneous increase in the frequencies of proliferating cells correlated with an increase in infiltrating leukocytes in the lung. Furthermore, a cytotoxic T cell response was detected but restricted to the respiratory route of virus entry such as the nose, the lung and the bronchoalveolar lavage according to detected enhanced perforin expression in &#945;&#946; and &#947;&#948; T cells in the respiratory tract. Increasing frequencies of CD8&#945;&#945; expressing &#945;&#946; T cells were also observed rapidly after the first infection, which could play a role in inhibition of uncontrolled inflammation in the respiratory tract. Authors conclude that the results from this study demonstrate that experimental influenza A virus infection in pigs mimics major characteristics of human seasonal influenza A virus infections. The manuscript is well written and provides interesting information, which complements findings of former studies.</p>
<p>1. The pigs used in the study were purchased from a commercial high health status herd. The detailed information on these pigs should be provided such as which pathogens (influenza A, D virus, PRRSV, PCV2 and mycoplasma etc) were tested prior to infection as any prior infection will impact the obtained results and further interpret.</p>
<p>Piglets were tested negative by qPCR for influenza A virus genome. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in sera of infected pigs only from day 14 post infection until the end of the study. We have not yet provided this information, as we do not consider it a core part of this study, which focuses on the cellular mucosal immune response. If desired, we can include viral titres and titration of neutralizing antibodies in new supplementary tables to provide additional information. </p>
<p>The farm from which the pigs were purchased is free from PRRSV, Pseudorabies, classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Mycoplasma hypopneumoniae, ascaris, mange, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and salmonella category I. which obviates the need for re-testing by our laboratory. Furthermore, the sows were vaccinated against PPV on the 170th and 190th day of life and against PCV 2 on day 160. Additionally, piglets themselves received vaccines against PCV2 and H. parasuis at their 14th day of life. This vaccination program together with the strict hygiene management (no contact to other animals, showers between the sheds, disposable clothing and masks within the sheds) makes a prior infection rather unlikely.</p>
<p>To address this issue, we included a section on pathogen status and vaccination program of the farm in Material and Methods section (lines 81-89): &#8220;This farm is free from the following diseases or pathogens: pseudorabies, classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Mycoplasma hypopneumoniae, ascaris, mange, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and salmonella category I. Vaccination program does not include vaccination against influenza viruses but the following vaccines were administered: Sows were vaccinated against porcine circovirus type 2 (once), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae/Porcine parvovirus (twice), salmonella (twice) and Haemophilus parasuis (twice). Piglets were vaccinated against PCV2 once and Mycoplasma hypopneumoniae twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. In the figures 5, 6, 9 and 10, the data from only infected pigs were presented despite of the data at d0 as controls. If the pigs were infected other pathogens before, these data could not reflect the reality of only infection of 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Therefore, it is necessary to provide more detailed information on pigs.</p>
<p>Yes, the reviewer is right, in Fig. 8, 9 and 10 we compared animals at different times of infection with only one control group at one time point. We have opted for this method to avoid excessive animal numbers. It is true that the control animals could also develop infections during the experimental period, so the control group was subjected to necropsy at the end of the experiment and not at the beginning. The animals all come from the same delivery, have the same age and were kept under comparable conditions (see reviewer 1, comment #2), so the error is considered to be minor. We have included information about health status of the pigs and the vaccination regime of the breeding farm in the manuscript. Thank you very much for this note.</p>
<p>The choice of correct controls is always difficult and controversial in these experiments: is the individual animal control (d0 before infection) superior to an untreated control group or vice versa? Animal-individual control has the error that an incalculable handling error (capture, frequent bleeding) is to be considered. In order best to present both situations equally well, we conducted two independent experiments in parallel with animals of the same origin and age: animal-individual non-lethal data from blood (Fig 5-7) and data for the organs after necropsy with an uninfected comparison group (Fig 8-10). </p>
<p>As stated above (reviewer 3, comment #1), pigs were tested negative for IAV genome by qPCR prior to infection. Additionally the vaccine program of the farm from which we purchased the piglets almost eliminates a prior infection with the mentioned porcine pathogens. Because contact to other animals was strictly avoided and hygiene management (also see reviewer 1, comment #2) was rigorously followed, it is rather unlikely that pigs were infected with other pathogens in the time of acclimatization in our animal facility under BSL2 conditions (four weeks prior to start of experiment). In addition, necropsies did only reveal a single lung lesion in one animal (in blood donating group) that could not be attributed to IAV infection. As already stated above, we included a section in Material and Methods section on pathogen status and vaccination program of the farm (lines 81-89).</p>
