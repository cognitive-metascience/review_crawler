<abstract>
<p>The mathematical models used in predictive microbiology contain parameters that must be estimated based on experimental data. Due to experimental uncertainty and variability, they cannot be known exactly and must be reported with a measure of uncertainty (usually a standard deviation). In order to increase precision (i.e. reduce the standard deviation), it is usual to add extra sampling points. However, recent studies have shown that precision can also be increased without adding extra sampling points by using Optimal Experiment Design, which applies optimization and information theory to identify the most informative experiment under a set of constraints. Nevertheless, to date, there has been scarce contributions to know <italic>a priori</italic> whether an experimental design is likely to provide the desired precision in the parameter estimates. In this article, two complementary methodologies to predict the parameter precision for a given experimental design are proposed. Both approaches are based on <italic>in silico</italic> simulations, so they can be performed before any experimental work. The first one applies Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the standard deviation of the model parameters, whereas the second one applies the properties of the Fisher Information Matrix to estimate the volume of the confidence ellipsoids. The application of these methods to a case study of dynamic microbial inactivation, showing how they can be used to compare experimental designs and assess their precision, is illustrated. The results show that, as expected, the optimal experimental design is more accurate than the uniform design with the same number of data points. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that, for some heating profiles, the uniform design does not ensure that a higher number of sampling points increases precision. Therefore, optimal experimental designs are highly recommended in predictive microbiology.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Predictive microbiology is nowadays a basic tool in food safety research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref001">1</xref>]. It provides mathematical models whose applications include the prediction of the microbial response to environmental conditions, such as those encountered during storage or food processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref002">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref004">4</xref>]. Another use of predictive models is inference, where the response to different bacteria is compared in order to, for instance, identify the most resistant bacterial strain to some treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Most of the mathematical models used in predictive microbiology are parametric models, with unknown parameter values that have to be estimated using experimental data. This requires the definition of an experimental design and carrying out the experiments. Then, a model fitting algorithm is used to calculate estimates for the model parameters. The precision and accuracy of the parameter estimates is critical for the precision of the model predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref008">8</xref>]. In this context, accuracy is understood as model predictions (or parameter estimates) being unbiased with respect to the actual values, whereas precision refers to their spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref009">9</xref>]. Accuracy can be tested by comparing model predictions against experimental observations not used for model fitting (e.g. isothermal versus non-isothermal experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref010">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref013">13</xref>]) or using resampling techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref014">14</xref>]. Precision can be quantified using some measure of uncertainty, for instance, the standard deviation of model parameters.</p>
<p>Because uncertainty and variability are inherent to any microbiological experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref015">15</xref>], a measure of precision must be reported in every predictive microbiology study and considered for model predictions. Therefore, a probabilistic approach must be followed, where model predictions are expressed as confidence regions, calculated based on the standard deviation of the model parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref016">16</xref>]. Situations with low uncertainty/variability will be reflected in small standard deviation of model parameters and, thus, narrow confidence regions for model predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>It is usually anticipated that an increase of the number of data points used for model fitting should improve the precision with which the model parameters are known, reducing their associated standard deviation. Several studies have shown that this can also be achieved through the use of alternative experimental designs, reducing the uncertainty of the model parameters with the same experimental work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref018">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref020">20</xref>]. This has led to the development of the field denominated Optimal Experiment Design (OED), which tries to find the most informative experimental setting under some constraints such as number of data points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref021">21</xref>]. It has been successfully applied to several applications in food science, such as the characterization of microbial growth and inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref022">22</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Different approaches have been applied to date for OED. One of the most extended is based on the properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), which measures the amount of information that a vector of observable random variables carries about a vector of unknowns (response variables) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref028">28</xref>]. Therefore, the FIM can be used to assess the efficacy for parameter estimation of different experimental designs and for obtaining optimal ones. It has several relevant properties for parameter estimation. For instance, according to the Cramer-Rao theorem, the inverse of the FIM is a lower bound of the covariance matrix of the model parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref029">29</xref>]. Hence, the inverse of the determinant of the FIM can be used as an estimate of the volume of the confidence hyper-ellipsoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref030">30</xref>]. This property leads to the so-called D-optimality criterion for OED. The superiority of D-optimal designs with respect to uniform designs has already been demonstrated in several works (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref032">32</xref>]).</p>
<p>The model parameters of models used in predictive microbiology usually have a biological meaning. For instance, the D-value describes the treatment time required to reduce the microbial count a 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref033">33</xref>]. Model parameters estimated under certain conditions are commonly used to, for example, infer the effectiveness of a treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref034">34</xref>]. Therefore, in many situations, the objective of experiments designed in the context of predictive microbiology is not prediction but the estimation of model parameter with enough precision (standard deviation) that enables accurate inference. Despite the advances in OED, there are still some open questions when it comes to designing such experiments. For instance, the number of sampling points is commonly decided based on previous experience. As a result, there is a high risk that the number of sampling points is excessive, leading to unnecessary experimental work, or too low, which would require posterior repetitions of the experiment. In this work, we explore the application of numerical techniques to reduce this uncertainty. We propose two complementary methodologies, the first one based on the properties of the FIM and the second one based on Monte Carlo simulations. Although both methods are usually applied to compare between different designs, here we illustrate how they can be used to aid in the decision process during the first stages of the experimental design. We describe their mathematical basis and illustrate how they can provide valuable information that may reduce the uncertainty of the experimental design (e.g. in the selection of the number of sampling points). For this, we analyze a case study related to dynamic microbial inactivation. Nevertheless, the applicability of these methods is not restricted to this case and could, in principle, be applied to any problem in the context of predictive microbiology.</p>

<p>In order to better illustrate the methodology proposed in a controlled setting, the work has been done <italic>in silico</italic> to avoid uncertainties introduced by the experimental methodology. <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> has been selected as model microorganism. According to the results of Garre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref017">17</xref>], it has been assumed that the Bigelow model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref035">35</xref>] is able to describe the non-isothermal survivor curve of this microorganism. This model is defined for non-isothermal conditions in Eq (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0220683.e001">1</xref>), where <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>ref</italic></sub> stands for the D-value (time required for ten-fold reduction of the microbial load) at the reference temperature, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>ref</italic></sub>.

The sensitivity of the D-value to temperature changes is quantified by the z-value, <italic>z</italic>, which states the temperature increase required for ten-fold reduction of the D-value.</p>

<p>Three different non-isothermal processing treatments have been tested. They have been selected because they are typical profiles used to characterize microbial inactivation. All of them begin between 30&#176;C and 45&#176;C, and reach a maximum temperature between 60 and 65&#176;C. However, the heating rate and the shape of the profile differ. Profiles named A and C are monotonically heating profiles with a heating rate of, respectively, 0.5&#176;C/min and 10&#176;C/min. Profile B is a biphasic profile, with a heating phase at 1&#176;C/min between 30 and 60&#176;C, followed by a cooling phase with the same cooling rate until the initial temperature is reached. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g001">Fig 1</xref> illustrates the three temperature profiles. Although there is experimental evidence indicating otherwise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref012">12</xref>], in order to simplify the simulations, it has been considered that the model parameters estimated by Garre et al.

<title>2.2 (Optimal) experiment designs considered</title>
<p>The type of data sampling of the experimental designs for dynamic microbial inactivation has been compared in this study. The first one is the &#8220;classical&#8221; uniform design, where sampling points are uniformly distributed through the duration of the experiment. The second is the approach to OED for dynamic microbial inactivation proposed by Garre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref017">17</xref>] and implemented in the <italic>bioOED</italic> package for R(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=bioOED" ns0:type="simple">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bioOED</ext-link>). This methodology is based on the optimization of a measure of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), an approach commonly followed for OED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref038">38</xref>], adding a penalty function to avoid infeasible experimental designs (with too close sampling points).</p>
<p>The functions included in the <italic>bioOED</italic> package allow to apply different optimality criterions of the FIM. In this work, the D-optimal criterion, which consists in the maximization of the determinant of the FIM, has been selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref039">39</xref>]. Other criteria have been suggested to identify OEDs. A popular alternative is the E-criterion, which tries to minimize the maximum uncertainty in parameter estimates (in the case studied here, the uncertainty of the parameter with the highest error) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref031">31</xref>]. Because this article tries to illustrate how computational methods can be used to aid experimental design and because this criterion has already been applied in a similar problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref017">17</xref>], this study is limited to the results of the D-criterion. A comparison between the precision of different designs is left for future work.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the OED is reduced to the optimization of the function shown in Eq (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0220683.e003">2</xref>), where <inline-formula id="pone.0220683.e002"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0220683.e002g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" ns0:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0220683.e002" ns0:type="simple" /><ns1:math display="inline" id="M2"><ns1:mfrac><ns1:mrow><ns1:mo>&#8706;</ns1:mo><ns1:mi>y</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mo>&#8706;</ns1:mo><ns1:mi>p</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:mfrac><ns1:mo>(</ns1:mo><ns1:mrow><ns1:msub><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>t</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>i</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:msub></ns1:mrow><ns1:mo>)</ns1:mo></ns1:math></alternatives></inline-formula> represents the first derivative of the outcome variable (the log-microbial count) with respect to each model parameter (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>ref</italic></sub> and <italic>z</italic> in the Bigelow model) evaluated at each sampling point, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. <italic>Q</italic> is a weight matrix, which has been set to the identity matrix.

<p>For every profile analysed, some areas of the sampling space are the most informative and the algorithm tends to locate samples in that location. As expected, the most informative design pattern depends on the shape of the thermal profile. These differences between profiles can be justified based on the local sensitivity functions of each profile, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g003">Fig 3</xref>. For profile A, samples are located close to the end of the treatment, at approximately 56 and 60 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <italic>t</italic> = 56 corresponds to a minimum of the sensitivity function with respect to the z-value and <italic>t</italic> = 60 to a supremum of both sensitivity functions. The algorithm is able to identify these areas and locates the sampling points in a configuration that satisfies the constraint related to the minimum distance between samples. For profile A, due to the large duration of the experiment (60 min) with respect to the minimum time between samples (3s), the restriction can be easily fulfilled. Hence, the frequency plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) shows a large area without any samples between the two informative areas.</p>

<p>Although profile C has a shape resembling the one of profile A, there are several differences that affect the optimal design pattern. Whereas the optimum design pattern for profile A distributes the samples in a balanced manner between <italic>t = 56</italic> and <italic>t = 60</italic>, for profile C the end of the experiment is favoured. This is due to the fact that the sensitivity functions (especially the one of the z-value) grow quickly with temperature for temperatures about the reference one. The maximum temperature in profile C is 65&#176;C, 5&#176;C higher than the one reached in profile A. Consequently, the minimum of the sensitivity function with respect to the z-value is less relevant in profile C than in profile A. Furthermore, the duration of profile C is much lower than the one of profile A (2 min vs 60 min). Therefore, the constraint related to the minimum distance between sampling points is much harder to fulfil and the design is more spread-out.</p>
<p>Profile B has a shape very different to the one of profiles A and C. Hence, the optimal design pattern for this profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) is very different to the one of the other two profiles. Several samples are located close to the middle of the treatment (<italic>t = 28</italic> and <italic>t = 32</italic>). Both points correspond, respectively, to a minimum and a maximum of the sensitivity function corresponding to the z-value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Besides this area, samples are located at the end of the experiment, where the sensitivity with respect of the D-value reaches its highest value.</p>

<title>3.2 Methodology I: Monte Carlo simulations</title>
<p>Most mathematical models used in food science have model parameters that have to be estimated using experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref001">1</xref>]. In this section, a methodology based on <italic>in silico</italic> simulations is proposed to predict the precision in model parameters (understood as the magnitude of their standard deviations) of an experimental design. It can be used to support experimental designs of processes described by parametric models. Although the Bigelow inactivation model is used in this example, this approach is not restricted to it and is extensible to other inactivation models or even other type of models (e.g. growth models).</p>
<p>As an example, let us design an experiment for the characterization of the inactivation kinetics of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> using non-isothermal experiments. The factors to consider for the experimental design are three: (1) the temperature profile to use (among the three selected), (2) the number of sampling points and (3) the location of those sampling points. Although previous studies have proposed algorithms to select optimal profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref043">43</xref>], this example will be limited to the study of the three inactivation profiles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Two criterions will be set to accept the experimental design: 1) that the estimated value of both model parameters (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>ref</italic></sub> and <italic>z</italic>) should be unbiased (the expected parameter estimates are equal to the values used for the simulations) and 2) their relative standard deviation lower than 0.1, where the relative standard deviation for parameter <italic>&#952;</italic> is defined as <inline-formula id="pone.0220683.e008"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0220683.e008g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" ns0:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0220683.e008" ns0:type="simple" /><ns1:math display="inline" id="M8"><ns1:msub><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>&#963;</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>r</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>e</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>l</ns1:mi><ns1:mo>,</ns1:mo><ns1:mi>&#952;</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:msub><ns1:mo>=</ns1:mo><ns1:mover accent="true"><ns1:mrow><ns1:msub><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>&#963;</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>&#952;</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:msub></ns1:mrow><ns1:mo>^</ns1:mo></ns1:mover><ns1:mo>/</ns1:mo><ns1:mover accent="true"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>&#952;</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow><ns1:mo>^</ns1:mo></ns1:mover></ns1:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula id="pone.0220683.e009"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0220683.e009g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" ns0:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0220683.e009" ns0:type="simple" /><ns1:math display="inline" id="M9"><ns1:mover accent="true"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>&#952;</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow><ns1:mo>^</ns1:mo></ns1:mover></ns1:math></alternatives></inline-formula> is the estimated value for <italic>&#952;</italic> and <inline-formula id="pone.0220683.e010"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0220683.e010g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" ns0:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0220683.e010" ns0:type="simple" /><ns1:math display="inline" id="M10"><ns1:msub><ns1:mrow><ns1:mover accent="true"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>&#963;</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow><ns1:mo>^</ns1:mo></ns1:mover></ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>&#952;</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:msub></ns1:math></alternatives></inline-formula> its standard deviation.</p>
<p>Without mathematical modelling analyses and tools it is not possible to assess if an experimental design will be successful at characterizing the microbial inactivation with the desired level of precision. This would require carrying out the experiment, fitting the model parameters and calculating their confidence intervals. If the precision was lower than expected, the experiment might have to be repeated, increasing the number of data points. The use of numerical simulations, which can be used to simulate the probability distributions of experimental results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref023">23</xref>] is suggested. Therefore, they can be used to simulate the quality of the model fit that would be obtained for an experimental situation. According to the materials and methods section, the following simulation scheme has been performed in this work:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Select a type of experimental design.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Simulate the &#8220;ideal&#8221; microbial concentration at the sampling points according to the Bigelow model.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Simulate three repetitions of the experiment adding an experimental error as additive white noise.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fit the model to the simulated inactivation data obtained using non-linear regression.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Based on previous experience in similar conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref006">6</xref>], the standard deviation of the error term has been set to 0.25 log CFU/ml for the numerical simulations. This implies that 95% of the observed log-microbial counts are expected to deviate from the ideal value less than &#177;0.5 log CFU/ml.</p>
<p>As described, the precision of the parameter estimates have been analysed using Monte Carlo simulations. In order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm, calculations have been repeated for different number of Monte Carlo simulations. Increasing their number beyond 100 simulations had no impact on the results (not shown), so the results obtained with 100 Monte Carlo simulations are reported. In every case, the distribution of the estimated model parameters was centred on the actual model parameters used for the simulations (<italic>D</italic><sub>57.5</sub> = 3.9 <italic>min</italic>, <italic>z</italic> = 4.2&#176;C), which indicates absence of bias as required. However, significant differences are observed in the standard deviations estimated using the OED and uniform designs, as well as between the different profiles. For profile A, when a uniform design with ten sampling points was used, the D-value was estimated with the required precision (<inline-formula id="pone.0220683.e011"><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0220683.e011g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" ns0:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0220683.e011" ns0:type="simple" /><ns1:math display="inline" id="M11"><ns1:msub><ns1:mrow><ns1:mover accent="true"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>&#963;</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow><ns1:mo>^</ns1:mo></ns1:mover></ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>r</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>e</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>l</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:msub><ns1:mo>&#8804;</ns1:mo><ns1:mn>0.1</ns1:mn></ns1:math></alternatives></inline-formula>) in 78% of the simulations, and only 7% for the z-value. On the other hand, the OED with ten sampling points provided much better results, attaining the desired precision in every simulation for both model parameters. For profile B, only 42% for the D-value and 0% for the z-value when a uniform experiment design with 10 points was used, and 94% for the D-value and 42% for the z-value when the OED was selected. Regarding profile C, the algorithm failed to calculate the standard deviation (the algorithm did not converge) of the model parameter in most simulations when the uniform experimental design with 10 sampling points was used. This is likely due to identifiability issues of the design. When the OED was used, the z-value was estimated with the desired precision in 99% of the simulations, but the D-value in none of them, possibly because most of the inactivation for profile C occurs in a short time (half a minute) at the end of the experiment. This result demonstrates that some inactivation profiles are more informative than others for estimating the D and z-values, even when an OED is used. Therefore, the shape of the temperature profile should be taken into account when designing experiments for characterization of microbial inactivation under dynamic conditions.</p>
<p>The <italic>in silico</italic> simulations enable the identification of profile A as the most informative among the ones tested. Furthermore, among all the options tested, only the experimental design with ten sampling points (with three repetitions) taken according to an OED for profile A are likely to attain the desired level of precision. Therefore, among the temperature profiles tested in this work, profile A should be the one used in laboratory conditions to characterize the inactivation kinetics of the case studied.</p>

<title>3.3 Methodology II: Properties of the FIM</title>
<p>The previous section has illustrated how numerical simulations can be applied to assess the likeliness that an experimental design provides the desired level of precision. However, is the number of sampling points selected optimal or could it be reduced with little impact in the precision of the parameter estimates? This question could be tackled following a similar procedure as the one used above, but Monte Carlo simulations are computationally intensive and the computational requirement to perform all the simulations is rather high. For this reason, a methodology based on the properties of the FIM is suggested in this section, to complement the Monte Carlo simulations. The calculation of the FIM (and its determinant) is less demanding from a computational point of view than the Monte Carlo simulations required for the method proposed in the previous section. Hence, it is feasible to calculate it for a large number of experimental designs. On the other hand, the FIM has several shortcomings as an estimator of the variance-covariance matrix (<italic>C</italic>) of the model parameters. According to the Cramer-Rao inequality, the FIM is a bound of <italic>C</italic> under several hypotheses that disregard possible non-linearity in the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref044">44</xref>]. Moreover, the calculation of the FIM and the local sensitivities can be complicated when errors are non-normally distributed, for instance when residuals are heteroscedastic or when they do not follow a normal distribution (e.g. a Poisson distribution). Also, local sensitivity functions can be hard to calculate when the parameter of interest is the variance (e.g. in studies such as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref045">45</xref>]). Monte Carlo simulations are more flexible than the procedure based on the FIM are can be applied in such cases with little complexity.</p>
<p>The determinant of the FIM for a uniform and optimal experimental designs has been calculated for the three temperature profiles considered for a varying number of sampling points (three to twenty). The calculated values are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g004">Fig 4</xref>, where the label of each subfigure correspond with the profile names (A and C monophasic profiles with heating rates of 0.5 and 10&#176;C/min, and B biphasic profile). In every case, the determinant of the FIM is lower for the OED than for the uniform design with the same number of sampling points. Therefore, it is to be expected that the OED will result in narrower confidence intervals than uniform designs for the same number of data points. This result is in line with previous conclusions from other authors who also compared uniform and optimal experimental designs for microbial inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref022">22</xref>], as well as with the results from the previous section. Indeed, (as highlighted by the dashed horizontal lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g004">Fig 4</xref>) 18, 13 and 8 uniformly distributed sampling points are needed, respectively, for profiles A, B and C to obtain the same determinant of the FIM that are obtained for an OED with only three data points (the minimum number of data points required to estimate a model with 2 model parameters with a minimum statistical rigour).</p>

</fig>
<p>Intuitively, it would be expected that an increase in the number of data points would result in a reduction of the uncertainty associated to the model parameters. However, this is not the case for every situation considered in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g004">Fig 4</xref>. In the OED, increasing the number of sampling points when their number is low (e.g. from three to four) has a strong positive effect in the determinant of the FIM. This effect diminishes when the number of sampling points is high. For instance, a plateau is observed for profile C when the number of sampling points is increased beyond ten. Consequently, increasing the number of sampling points beyond these numbers brings little benefit when an OED is used.</p>
<p>Regarding the uniform experimental design, the behaviour observed for profiles A and C is similar to the one observed for the OED. When the number of sampling points is low, adding one more has a strong positive influence in the information provided by the experiment and, consequently, in the precision of the parameter estimates. This impact is progressively diminished as the number of sampling points is increased. Indeed, it plateaus for profile C for more than 12 sampling points. As already discussed above, this is caused by the constraint regarding the minimum distance between sampling points. Due to the shorter duration of this profile, the restriction is hard to fulfil and samples are located in areas that provide little information (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g002">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g003">3C</xref>). Therefore, there is a limit in the amount of information that can be extracted for a thermal profile, when a restriction is included to limit the minimum distance between sampling points. For a number of samples beyond this limit, the inverse of the determinant of the FIM may slightly increase due to the numerical error involved in the calculations. Nonetheless, from the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, it is unreasonable to increase the number of samples beyond 12 for profile C.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, OEDs remain much more informative than uniform designs for the range of data points tested. On the other hand, for temperature profile B, the relationship between the inverse of the determinant of the FIM and the number of sampling points is not monotonically decreasing. Uniform experimental designs with an even number of sampling points are consistently more informative than designs with an odd number of points. The reason for this is the shape of the local sensitivity functions for the Bigelow model in this type of temperature profile. As already illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g003">Fig 3</xref>, local sensitivity functions are strongly dependent on the type of temperature profile. Consequently, the location of the most informative sampling points depends on the shape of the profile. OED takes into account the amount of information when the number of sampling points is increased by one. On the other hand, uniform designs simply place the new point according to a uniform partition of the sampling space. Therefore, sampling points may be &#8220;moved&#8221; from very informative positions to ones where local sensitivities are very close to zero, reducing the information extracted from the system. This is the case for profile C, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Hence, not only is the uniform experimental design less informative for dynamic microbial inactivation than OED when the same number of data points is used, but also increasing the number of sampling points in a uniform sampling scheme may reduce the information gained from the experiment.</p>
<p>The differences between the thermal profiles used are not limited to the effect observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g004">Fig 4C</xref>. The value of the inverse of the determinant of the FIM depends on the thermal profile, with profile A taking lower values than profile C, and profile B taking the highest one (note that the subplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g004">Fig 4</xref> have a different scale to ease comparison between the uniform and optimal designs). Due to the properties of the FIM as estimator of the covariance matrix, the confidence regions estimated from the experiments are expected to be the smallest for thermal profile A. This agrees with the result obtained in the example illustrated in section 3.1, where the standard deviation of the model parameters estimated for profile A was the lowest in comparison with the rest, when the same number of sampling points were used. Therefore, the precision of the parameter estimates is not only affected by the position of the sampling points. Other aspects of the experimental design, such as the thermal profile used for the experiments also affects the parameter estimates. This result is in agreement with the one reported by Van Derlinden et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref027">27</xref>], who used global optimization to find the most efficient thermal profile for parameter estimation in microbial inactivation.</p>
<p>In order to validate these hypotheses, based on the assumption that the FIM is a good estimator of the covariance matrix, Monte Carlo simulations have been performed for various experimental designs following the methodology illustrated in section 3.1. The results of these simulations are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g005">Fig 5</xref>, where the mean standard deviation of the model parameters (D-value at the reference temperature and z-value) of 100 Monte Carlo simulations is illustrated for the three temperature profiles considered in this study for experimental designs (uniform and optimal) with different number of sampling points. These results confirm the conclusions drawn based on the properties of the FIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g004">Fig 4</xref>). For experimental designs with the same number of sampling points, profile A calculates parameter values with smaller standard deviations for the D and the z values than profiles B and C. Furthermore, the simulations confirm that increasing the number of sampling points does not ensure a greater precision for a uniform experimental design. An increase in the number of data points from eight to nine for profile B has a negative impact in the precision of the parameter estimates. The standard deviation of the D-value is increased by a factor of 36 (121 vs 3.39) and for the z-value by a factor of 13 (18 vs 1.39).</p>

<p>Moreover, the superiority of optimal designs with respect to uniform designs is clearly evidenced for every profile. For profile A, an OED with three measurement points provides a similar precision than a uniform design with 20 measurements for the z-value but a higher precision for the D-value. For profile B, an OED with three sampling points provides more precision than a uniform design with ten sampling points in both parameters. Finally, for profile C, an OED with three sampling points provides more precision than a uniform design with 14 sampling points, also considering both parameters. This result differs slightly from those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g004">Fig 4</xref>, in which e.g., for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g004">Fig 4B</xref> an OED with 3 sampling points provides approximately the same information as a uniform design with 8 sampling points. These deviations can be due to the fact that a confidence interval (or the standard deviation) is unidimensional and does not consider the correlation between the parameter estimates, whereas the determinant of the FIM (which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220683.g004">Fig 4</xref>) does consider it. Another hypothesis is the effect of model non-linearities that are not considered in the FIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref044">44</xref>]. The position of the sampling points has an impact on the correlation of the parameter estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0220683.ref007">7</xref>], so it is to be expected that the correlation between the D-value and the z-value calculated in the uniform design is different from the one obtained using the OED, thus affecting the comparison. Nevertheless, this deviation has a small impact and does not affect the conclusions drawn from the properties of the FIM: (1) the higher precision of the OED, (2) the higher information gained from profile A and (3) that increasing the number of points in a uniform design does not ensure a higher precision.</p>
<p>Both approaches presented here are complementary. The determinant of the FIM can be easily calculated for a large number of experimental designs (including different temperature profiles) and can be used to identify experimental settings that seem more efficient. Then, the Monte Carlo simulations can be used to calculate the accuracy in the parameter estimates expected from the application of this approach. Also, some typical model assumptions (e.g. homogeneity of the residuals) can be checked by means of the Monte Carlo simulations. Both techniques do not require any experimental data, so they can be done before experimental work is carried out. Hence, they can guide experimental design, identifying what inactivation profiles and designs are the more informative, as well as predicting whether an experimental design is likely to provide the desired precision in parameter estimates. Although the case studies have been limited to the Bigelow model and microbial inactivation, the hypotheses used to build the methodology are not limited to this case, and can be applied to other inactivation models and, even, other type of experiments (e.g. microbial growth).</p>

<title>4. Conclusions</title>
<p>The use of numerical simulations to aid on experimental designs has been illustrated in this work. Two complementary approaches have been proposed. The first, based on Monte Carlo simulations, can be used to assess whether an experimental design is likely to provide the desired level of precision. This approach is computationally intensive, so a second method, based on the properties of the FIM, has been suggested. The calculations required to apply it are affordable using current hardware and can easily be applied to compare between a large number of experimental designs. These methodologies enable to estimate whether an experimental design (with a selected number of sampling points) is likely to provide the desired precision in the parameter estimates (size of confidence intervals).</p>
<p>This methodology has been applied to compare between different experimental designs and inactivation profiles, identifying the most informative ones. The results highlight the advantages of OED with respect to uniform ones, attaining a higher precision in the parameter estimates in every situation tested. Moreover, the simulation results show that the addition of one sampling point in a uniform experimental design does not ensure an increase in accuracy. Hence, optimal designs are more robust and efficient than uniform designs. In spite of the overhead required for their calculation, they are recommended for researchers in food safety.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Summary:</p>
<p>The authors discuss the use of OED for identifying the Bigelow model for thermal microbial inactivation. Specifically, the manuscript focusses on the selection of the sampling times and the type of temperature profile.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>- The statement on lines 88 and 89 is either not really correct or the authors did not clearly state what they meant. Since OED has been applied in predictive microbiology for over 20 years, it definitely falls already in the category of &#8220;currently available techniques&#8221;. As stated in the article, by simply calculating the inverse of the FIM for a proposed experimental design, it is already possible to have an idea of the precision that will be obtained on the parameter estimates (and this is just the underlying principle of OED). Therefore, currently available techniques can definitely provide such information.</p>
<p>- In general, the final section of the introduction (lines 88-100) should more clearly state the novelty of this research. Is it just providing information on optimal sampling schemes? Or is it the underlying method for determining such sampling schemes? Try to state more clearly what knowledge was already available and what is novel about this work with respect to the available research.</p>
<p>- The penalty function that is used (lines 153-162), appears to provide a weighting that is very arbitrary. Why don&#8217;t the authors apply constraints on the sampling times to be optimised? Using a set of linear inequality constraints could lead to a much less arbitrary solution to the same problem.</p>
<p>- For the results presented in Section 3.1, the sampling points of the OED designs should be illustrated and discussed. Use, e.g., a relative frequency bar chart to illustrate all sample points over the Monte Carlo simulation. These charts can be represented as three subfigures, corresponding with those of Figure 1. It should be possible to link these sampling points with the sensitivity equations in Figure 3.</p>

<p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript shows an interesting case study of microbial inactivation in foods with in-silico simulation analysis to support the suggestion of the two complementary methodologies to predict the parameter precision for a given experimental design. The manuscript is sound, but some major concerns are listed, and minor corrections are suggested below.</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>- Lines 115-121: The three profiles proposed have very different heating rates which impact on microbial inactivation. What assumptions were made to propose these temperature profiles? Can authors propose other temperature profiles, based on some thermal treatment of real food or other more realistic profiles for the case study (e.g. with residence time)? This is a concerning limitation issue, as suggested by own authors (lines 196-198) &#8220;Although previous studies have proposed algorithms to select optimal profiles, this example will be limited to the study of the three inactivation profiles shown in Figure 1&#8221;.</p>
<p>- Lines 144-145: Did authors test FIM criterions other than D-optimal? Why was D-optimal chosen? Advantages/disadvantages of that criterion against others in the context of the study (model and assumptions) should be presented.</p>
<p>- Lines 229-232: &#8220;One hundred Monte Carlo simulations have been performed, considering ten sampling points for each experimental design (OED and uniform) for each temperature profile. Simulations have been repeated with a higher number of simulations without observing differences in the results (not shown)&#8221;. Why the simulation tests started from ten sampling points? Kinetic inactivation experiments often have less than ten sampling points due to practical experimental issues. Furthermore, experiments should be simulated from less than ten sampling points in order to identify differences in the results (since no differences were reported with ten or more sampling points).</p>
<p>- Lines 249-251: &#8220;Therefore, the shape of the temperature profile should be taken into account when designing experiments for characterization of microbial inactivation under dynamic conditions&#8221;. Did authors try to design optimal temperature profiles before or together with optimal sampling points?</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>- Lines 22-24. Present some reference about &#8220;scarce contributions&#8221;.</p>
<p>- Lines 78-81: FIM to quantify information in OED has been applied before Lehmann and Casella (1998).</p>
<p>- Line 120: 0.5 &#186;C/min and 10 &#186;C/min (and instead comma).</p>
<p>- Line 147: The &#8220;equation&#8221; (2) is incomplete (equal to?).</p>
<p>- Lines 183-226: Many information is about method and should be presented in appropriate section. Unnecessary repeated information can be removed. Results effectively start to be shown at line 231.</p>
<p>- Lines 242-243: &#8220;most of the inactivation occurs in a short time at the end of the experiment&#8221;. In Profile B most of the inactivation occurs at the middle of the experiment. In the end of the experiment, almost no inactivation occurs (due to the low temperature), as can be seen in Figure 1.</p>
<p>- Lines 298-318: Authors discussed about loss of information in uniform design measured by the inverse of the FIM determinant. In Figure 2C, there is an unexpected loss of information of OED experiment when adding from 16 to 17 points. How authors can explain this fact?</p>
<p>- Lines 374-375: &#8220;(3) that increasing the number of points in a uniform design does not ensure a higher precision&#8221;, as well as in some OED (e.g. profile C).</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewers and editor for their insightful comments on the paper, as they led us to improve its overall quality. Please find below our replies to the comments, including details about the corresponding changes incorporated in the new revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
<p>Reviewer #1:</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors discuss the use of OED for identifying the Bigelow model for thermal microbial inactivation. Specifically, the manuscript focusses on the selection of the sampling times and the type of temperature profile.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>- The statement on lines 88 and 89 is either not really correct or the authors did not clearly state what they meant. Since OED has been applied in predictive microbiology for over 20 years, it definitely falls already in the category of &#8220;currently available techniques&#8221;. As stated in the article, by simply calculating the inverse of the FIM for a proposed experimental design, it is already possible to have an idea of the precision that will be obtained on the parameter estimates (and this is just the underlying principle of OED). Therefore, currently available techniques can definitely provide such information.</p>
<p>- In general, the final section of the introduction (lines 88-100) should more clearly state the novelty of this research. Is it just providing information on optimal sampling schemes? Or is it the underlying method for determining such sampling schemes? Try to state more clearly what knowledge was already available and what is novel about this work with respect to the available research.</p>
<p>We acknowledge both reviewer&#8217;s comments and agree in the fact that the novelty of this research was not correctly described in the original manuscript. We have rewritten the final part of the introduction addressing the two major comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The superiority of D-optimal designs with respect to uniform designs has been already demonstrated in several works (e.g. (Balsa-Canto et al., 2008; Garre et al., 2018b; Stamati et al., 2016).</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the advances in OED, there is still high uncertainty in experimental design in the context of predictive microbiology. The most common goal of this type of experiments is the calculation of parameter estimates with a precision above a minimum (standard deviation of the model parameters). To date, there is not a clear methodology to estimate this. Therefore, some parameters of the design (e.g. the number of sampling points) is selected based on previous experience. Hence, there is a high risk that the number of sampling points is excessive, leading to unnecessary experimental work, or too low, which would require posterior repetitions of the experiment. In this work, we explore the application of numerical techniques to reduce this uncertainty. We propose two complementary methodologies, the first one based on the properties of the FIM and the second one based on Monte Carlo simulations. Although they have been applied in previous studies to compare between different designs, here we describe their mathematical basis and illustrate how they can be used to aid experimental design, reducing the risk of designs with excessive or too few sampling points. For this, we analyze a case study related to dynamic microbial inactivation. Nevertheless, the applicability of these methods is not restricted to this case and could, in principle, be applied to any problem in the context of predictive microbiology. &#8220;</p>
<p>- The penalty function that is used (lines 153-162), appears to provide a weighting that is very arbitrary. Why don&#8217;t the authors apply constraints on the sampling times to be optimised? Using a set of linear inequality constraints could lead to a much less arbitrary solution to the same problem.</p>
<p>We have used in this work the same penalization scheme that was used in Garre et al. (2018), where we explored different ways to describe the constraint. We agree that for most &#8220;classical&#8221; optimization algorithms linear inequality constraints are usually the best way to define this type of constraints. However, the optimization problem to be solved in the FIM-based OED requires a global optimization method which overcomes non-convexity issues. For that reason, we chose MEIGO which, as a metaheuristic, follows a very different strategy for the optimization. For this algorithm, linear inequality constraints were way less efficient (number of function evaluations) than the penalty function.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we believe that a comparison of different ways to define the constraint is out of the scope of this research work. Note that our goal is the identification of experimental designs that are the most informative while, at the same time, being feasible from an experimental point of view. The way we have formulated the problem enables to calculate this in a reasonable time (some minutes) in a laptop (Windows 10, 1 core with 8 GB of RAM). More efficient formulations may exist for this particular problem, but exploring them would bring little benefit to the objective of this particular research work.</p>
<p>- For the results presented in Section 3.1, the sampling points of the OED designs should be illustrated and discussed. Use, e.g., a relative frequency bar chart to illustrate all sample points over the Monte Carlo simulation. These charts can be represented as three subfigures, corresponding with those of Figure 1. It should be possible to link these sampling points with the sensitivity equations in Figure 3.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer&#8217;s comment and agree that this is a relevant point that was not addressed in the original manuscript. As suggested, we have added a new subsection to the R&amp;D section where the OEDs are described (section 3.1). It includes a new plot (Figure 2 in the new version). The new section now reads (L201-243):</p>
<p>3.1 Description of the Optimal Experiment Designs identified</p>
<p>Figure 2 gives a qualitative description of the designs identified as optimal for each one of the profiles analyzed (Figure 1), as well as on how they vary when the number of samples is increased. The x-axis represents the sample space (the duration of the experiment) and the height of the bars the number of samples that are located at a given location. The total number of sample points is represented by the colour of the bar (see legend in Figure 2). The bars corresponding to different number of points are stacked on top of each other, so the total height of the bar is a representation of the use of a time point across a different number of samples.</p>
<p>For every profile analyzed, some areas of the sampling space are the most informative and the algorithm tends to locate samples in that location.  As expected, the most informative design pattern depends on the shape of the thermal profile. These differences between profiles can be justified based on the local sensitivity functions of each profile, shown in Figure 3. For profile A, samples are located in close to the end of the treatment, at approximately 56 and 60 minutes (Figure 2A). As illustrated in Figure 3A, t=56 corresponds to a minimum of the sensitivity function with respect to the z-value and t=60 to a supremum of both sensitivity functions. The algorithm is able to identify these areas and locates the sampling points in a configuration that satisfies the constraint related to the minimum distance between samples. For profile A, due to the large duration of the experiment (60 min) with respect to the minimum time between samples (3s), the restriction can be easily fulfilled. Hence, the frequency plot (Figure 2A) shows a large area without any samples between the two informative areas. </p>
<p>Figure 2: Frequency bar plot illustrating the OED calculated for the three profiles analyzed (A, B and C). The colour of the bar indicates the total number of sampling points. </p>
<p>Figure 3: Scaled local sensitivity functions of profile A (A), B (B) and C (C) with respect to the D-value (-) and the z-value (--).</p>
<p>Although profile C has a shape resembling the one of profile A, there are several differences that affect the optimal design pattern. Whereas the optimum design pattern for profile A distributes the samples in a balanced manner between t = 56 and t = 60, for profile C the end of the experiment is favoured. This is due to the fact that the sensitivity functions (especially the one of the z-value) grow quickly with temperature for temperatures about the reference one. The maximum temperature in profile C is 65&#65533;C, 5&#65533;C higher than the one reached in profile A. Consequently, the minimum of the sensitivity function with respect to the z-value is less relevant in profile C than in profile A. Furthermore, the duration of profile C is much lower than the one of profile A (2 min vs 60 min). Therefore, the constraint related to the minimum distance between sampling points is much harder to fulfil and the design is more spread-out. </p>
<p>Profile B has a shape very different from those of profiles A and C. Hence, the optimal design pattern for this profile (Figure 2B) is very different to the one of the other two profiles. Several samples are located close to the middle of the treatment (t = 28 and t = 32). Both points correspond, respectively, to a minimum and a maximum of the sensitivity function corresponding to the z-value (Figure 3B). Besides this area, samples are located at the end of the experiment, where the sensitivity with respect of the D-value reaches its highest value. </p>
<p>- It is not really clear to me what the advantage is of the Monte Carlo method proposed in this publication. Why would you not just use the approximation of the variance-covariance matrix based on the inverse of the FIM of your design to estimate the uncertainty on the model parameters? What is the added value of this Monte Carlo simulation?</p>
<p>The reviewer raises an interesting concern that was not properly addressed in the 1st version of the manuscript. The FIM has several shortcomings as an estimator of the variance-covariance matrix (C). First, according to the Cramer-Rao inequality, the FIM is a lower bound of the C. Moreover, the FIM does not take into account non-linearities in the model (10.3389/fbioe.2019.00122). Furthermore, the formulation of the FIM used in this work (as well as in most scientific works) is based on the hypothesis that the model is perfect and that errors are normal. </p>
<p>The article has been expanded discussing this:</p>
<p>(L329): &#8220;On the other hand, the FIM has several shortcomings as an estimator of the variance-covariance matrix (C) of the model parameters. According to the Cramer-Rao inequality, the FIM is a bound of C under several hypotheses that disregard possible non-linearity in the model (Krausch et al., 2019). Moreover, the calculation of the FIM and the local sensitivities can be complicated when errors are non-normally distributed, for instance when residuals are heteroscedastic or when they do not follow a normal distribution (e.g. a Poisson distribution). Also, local sensitivity functions can be hard to calculate when the parameter of interest is the variance (e.g. in studies such as (Aryani et al., 2015)). Monte Carlo simulations are more flexible than the procedure based on the FIM are can be applied in such cases with little complexity.&#8221;</p>
<p>(L458): &#8220;Also, more complex hypotheses that are hard to implement in the FIM (e.g. heteroscedasticity of the residuals) can be implemented in the Monte Carlo simulations assess their impact.  &#8220;</p>

<p>Reviewer #2</p>
<p>The manuscript shows an interesting case study of microbial inactivation in foods with in-silico simulation analysis to support the suggestion of the two complementary methodologies to predict the parameter precision for a given experimental design. The manuscript is sound, but some major concerns are listed, and minor corrections are suggested below.</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>- Lines 115-121: The three profiles proposed have very different heating rates which impact on microbial inactivation. What assumptions were made to propose these temperature profiles? Can authors propose other temperature profiles, based on some thermal treatment of real food or other more realistic profiles for the case study (e.g. with residence time)? This is a concerning limitation issue, as suggested by own authors (lines 196-198) &#8220;Although previous studies have proposed algorithms to select optimal profiles, this example will be limited to the study of the three inactivation profiles shown in Figure 1&#8221;.</p>
<p>In lines 197-207, the parameters considered on the case study are described. They include the number of sampling points, their location and a selection between 3 different temperature profiles. We are analysing designs with between 3 and 20 sampling points. This means that we are comparing 108 different possible experimental designs (18 number of samples, uniform/OED, 3 profiles). Including the shape of the profile as an additional factor would increase very much the number of designs to be analysed without adding a significant information to the study.</p>
<p>Regarding the effect of the heating rates, this is a very interesting point. Their impact on the heating rates is still an active research field (e.g. 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2017.11.023; 10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.05.042). Therefore, it is not possible to include this factor in this type of analysis. This hypothesis was already described in the original version of the manuscript (L122-129: &#8220;Although there is experimental evidence indicating otherwise&#8230;&#8221;) </p>
<p>- Lines 144-145: Did authors test FIM criterions other than D-optimal? Why was D-optimal chosen? Advantages/disadvantages of that criterion against others in the context of the study (model and assumptions) should be presented.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer&#8217;s comment.  We opted for using the D-criterion because it had been successfully used in similar problems. Being a relevant comment, we believe that comparison among optimality criterions is out of the scope of this research. The text has been modified discussing this point:</p>
<p>&#8221; Other criteria have been suggested to identify OEDs. A popular alternative is the E-criterion, which tries to minimize the maximum error (the model parameter with the highest error) (Balsa-Canto et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the D-criterion is preferred in some circumstances met in the case study presented here (Balsa-Canto et al., 2010) &#8220;</p>
<p>- Lines 229-232: &#8220;One hundred Monte Carlo simulations have been performed, considering ten sampling points for each experimental design (OED and uniform) for each temperature profile. Simulations have been repeated with a higher number of simulations without observing differences in the results (not shown)&#8221;. Why the simulation tests started from ten sampling points? Kinetic inactivation experiments often have less than ten sampling points due to practical experimental issues. Furthermore, experiments should be simulated from less than ten sampling points in order to identify differences in the results (since no differences were reported with ten or more sampling points).</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer comment. The actual meaning of the paragraph (that we had made sure that the Monte Carlo algorithm had converged) was not clear in the original manuscript. We have rewritten that paragraph clarifying this topic.</p>
<p>&#8220;As described, the precision of the parameter estimates have been analysed using Monte Carlo simulations. In order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm, calculations have been repeated for different number of Monte Carlo simulations. Increasing their number beyond 100 simulations had no impact on the results (not shown), so the results obtained with 100 Monte Carlo simulations are reported.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have added a new subsection to the R&amp;D section where the OEDs are described (section 3.1). This also helps to clarify the reviewer concern.</p>
<p>- Lines 249-251: &#8220;Therefore, the shape of the temperature profile should be taken into account when designing experiments for characterization of microbial inactivation under dynamic conditions&#8221;. Did authors try to design optimal temperature profiles before or together with optimal sampling points?</p>
<p>This point is, on its core, the same as MC#1. The shape of the temperature profile as a factor would very much increase the computational time without adding essential information to the results, which show that OED outperforms uniform designs in every case.</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>- Lines 22-24. Present some reference about &#8220;scarce contributions&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although we appreciate the reviewer&#8217;s comment, the guidelines for PlosONE discourage the use of references in the abstract. In the introduction, this point is further discussed including references.</p>
<p>- Lines 78-81: FIM to quantify information in OED has been applied before Lehmann and Casella (1998).</p>
<p>We acknowledge the comment. The last part of the introduction has been rewritten clearly stating the novelty of the work.</p>
<p>- Line 120: 0.5 &#186;C/min and 10 &#186;C/min (and instead comma).</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer&#8217;s comment. Corrected.</p>
<p>- Line 147: The &#8220;equation&#8221; (2) is incomplete (equal to?).</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer&#8217;s comment. However, that is the standard way of writing an optimization problem (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem" ns0:type="simple">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem</ext-link>).</p>
<p>- Lines 183-226: Many information is about method and should be presented in appropriate section. Unnecessary repeated information can be removed. Results effectively start to be shown at line 231.</p>
<p>We understand the reviewer comment. However, it must be understood that in this work analysis methods are not just a tool to analyse the data and reach conclusions. This research proposes the application of numerical methods to aid in the experimental design before any sampling point is taken. Hence, we believe that the discussion regarding how these can be actually applied and their limitations belongs to the R&amp;D section, rather than to M&amp;M. Future studies where this methodology is applied should describe it in M&amp;M, but we believe that they belong to R&amp;D in this work.</p>
<p>- Lines 242-243: &#8220;most of the inactivation occurs in a short time at the end of the experiment&#8221;. In Profile B most of the inactivation occurs at the middle of the experiment. In the end of the experiment, almost no inactivation occurs (due to the low temperature), as can be seen in Figure 1.</p>
<p>The reviewer&#8217;s comment is acknowledged. However, we are referring just to profile C in this sentence. It has been rewritten for clarification:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;because most of the inactivation for profile C occurs in a short time (half a minute) at the end of the experiment&#8221;</p>
<p>- Lines 298-318: Authors discussed about loss of information in uniform design measured by the inverse of the FIM determinant. In Figure 2C, there is an unexpected loss of information of OED experiment when adding from 16 to 17 points. How authors can explain this fact?</p>
<p>The results shown in former Figure 2 (now Figure 4 after creating a new one and renumber the rest as suggested by Reviewer #1) require the application of several numerical methods (OED, sensitivity functions, determinant of the FIM, optimization) that introduce a numerical error (truncation and round-up) in the result. This is introducing some &#8220;noise&#8221; in the results shown in (former) Figure 2. Nonetheless, the OED remains much more informative than the uniform design. Moreover, according to the results of this investigation, increasing the number of sampling points for this profile beyond 12 samples is simply unreasonable. </p>
<p>The text has been modified clarifying these points:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;This impact is progressively diminished as the number of sampling points is increased. Indeed, it plateaus for profile C for more than 12 sampling points. This is caused by the constraint regarding the minimum distance between sampling points, that does not enable to increase the amount of information. Therefore, there is a limit in the amount of information that can be extracted for a thermal profile, when a restriction is included to limit the minimum distance between sampling points. For a number of samples beyond this limit, the inverse of the determinant of the FIM may slightly increase due to the numerical error involved in the calculations. Nonetheless, from the results in Figure 2C, it is unreasonable to increase the number of samples beyond 12 for profile C.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Lines 374-375: &#8220;(3) that increasing the number of points in a uniform design does not ensure a higher precision&#8221;, as well as in some OED (e.g. profile C).</p>
<p>This point is discussed in the previous minor correction.</p>
<p>- Lines 471-472: Garre et al. 2017b reference is incomplete.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer&#8217;s comment. It has been completed.</p>
<p>- Figure 3: The elements of the figure should have complete description in the caption. Information about A and B, red and green curves.</p>
<p>We understand that this information is already present in the legend: &#8220;Scaled local sensitivity functions of profile A (A) and B (B) with respect to the D-value (-) and the z-value (--).&#8221; &#8220;A&#8221; shows the sensitivity functions for profile A and &#8220;B&#8221; for profile B. The red curve is the sensitivity with respect to the D-value and green, dashed curve with respect to z.</p>

<p>Major comments</p>
<p>- [Lines 105- 120]: The authors should clarify what to they mean by &#8216;there is still high uncertainty&#8217; in the experimental designs used in predictive microbiology. Indeed the common tendency to set aspects of the experimental scheme adopted for model calibration based on past experience/technical limitations of the experimental system/acquisition platform applies to the proposed investigation (where only the effect of the number and location sampling times is considered, albeit not optimised). The authors should clearly state the reason for which they focus only on sampling times, as they could have investigated the effect of other aspects (e.g. the thermal perturbation profile). In addition, the use of scalar functions of the FIM to optimise experimental schemes is now routine. In this context, the actual contribution of this manuscript should be emphasised.</p>
<p>- The adopted formulation of the penalty function to set a constraint on the sampling frequency requires clarification. I understand that a similar formulation was adopted in a previous publication by the same authors, but i) hybrid solvers can cope with linear inequality constraints in FIM-based OED; ii) the optimisation cost cannot be too high in the considered case (1D model with 2 parameters).</p>
<p>- [Lines 167- 170]: E-criterion attempts to minimise the maximum uncertainty in parameter estimates (not the parameter with the highest error). In addition, the authors should clearly state which aspects of D-optimality meet &#8216;circumstances&#8217; in their study case.</p>
<p>- Among the mentioned limitations of the FIM-based approach, local validity in the parameter space (i.e. computations are performed in the neighbourhood of the a priori unknown optimal/true parameters values) is the most relevant. I could not find any reference to how the initial uncertainty in parameter estimates was accounted for. This is a crucial point for applicability of the outlined methods. The application of the methods cannot precede the acquisition of some experimental data.</p>
<p>- An elusive comparison of the informative content of thermal profiles is presented. Due to the low dimensionality of the mathematical model, the simultaneous optimisation of i) number of sampling times, ii) their location and iii) the perturbation profile would have been feasible and of high interest.</p>
<p>- The conclusions drawn from the research provide limited insights and a more in depth analysis should be performed. It is intuitive that experience-based experimental schemes provide a lower bound of the performances of OED, otherwise we would not put effort in optimisation. The fact that one perturbation scheme results more informative than others is useful only if patterns identified support the extrapolation of &#8216;rules for informativeness&#8217;. Finally it seems obvious that data are not equally informative, so that increasing their cardinality might not convey additional information in uniform schemes.</p>

<p>Reviewer #3:</p>
<p>The manuscript focusses on the use of Optimal Experimental Design (OED) to identify the most informative sampling schedule for the calibration of the Bigelow model for thermal microbial inactivation.</p>
<p>Despite an overall improvement can be detected in the second version of the manuscript, some of the concerns highlighted by previous reviewers have not been adequately addressed by the authors.</p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>- [Lines 105- 120]: The authors should clarify what to they mean by &#8216;there is still high uncertainty&#8217; in the experimental designs used in predictive microbiology. Indeed the common tendency to set aspects of the experimental scheme adopted for model calibration based on past experience/technical limitations of the experimental system/acquisition platform applies to the proposed investigation (where only the effect of the number and location sampling times is considered, albeit not optimised). The authors should clearly state the reason for which they focus only on sampling times, as they could have investigated the effect of other aspects (e.g. the thermal perturbation profile). In addition, the use of scalar functions of the FIM to optimise experimental schemes is now routine. In this context, the actual contribution of this manuscript should be emphasised.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer&#8217;s comment. By &#8220;high uncertainty&#8221; we refer to a very common question in any microbiology laboratory: &#8220;how many sampling points do I need?&#8221; This can refer, for instance, to the number of sampling points taken in an inactivation experiment for characterizing the microbial response. This is usually decided based on experience. As a result, there is a high risk of designing experiments with too many points (resulting in additional experimental work) or with too few (requiring a repetition of the experiment). In this article, we propose the application of numerical techniques as a science-based approach to aid in experimental design.</p>
<p>In this research we optimize the position of sampling times. We apply the methodology for OED we previously developed (Garre et al., 2018b) to identify optimal sampling schemes (Section 2.2; Figure 2). Including the shape of the thermal profile as a parameter of the experimental design is an interesting exercise from the point of view of the experimental design that was studied in a previous research work (van Derlinden et al., 2010). However, we have some concerns regarding that approach from a biological point of view. It has been demonstrated that the shape of the thermal profile (i.e. the heating rate) can affect the microbial response. If the heating is slow, a physiological response can be triggered in the cells that increases their stress resistance (Corradini and Peleg, 2009; Dolan et al., 2013; Garre et al., 2018c, 2018a; Hassani et al., 2007, 2006; Stasiewicz et al., 2008; Valdramidis et al., 2007). Fast heating profiles can also influence the bacterial response to stress (de Jong et al., 2012; de Jonge, 2019; Huertas et al., 2016). The model-based approach for OED applied here is based on the hypothesis that the design does not affect the validity of the model (i.e. of the model parameters). We understand that including the shape of the temperature profile as a variable in the optimization problem collides with this hypothesis, due to the experimental evidence which indicates that it affects the microbial response. Nevertheless, the effect of heating rates on microbial inactivation is still an active research topic. A detailed discussion of this matter would take the focus out of the main research question addressed in the article, so it has not been included in the manuscript. </p>
<p>We disagree with the claim that OED is common practice in predictive microbiology. Although it is more commonly used in other fields (e.g. systems biology), uniform sampling schemes are still the default approach for describing microbial growth and/or inactivation under non-isothermal conditions (Conesa et al., 2009; Corradini and Peleg, 2004; Franco-Vega et al., 2015; Haberbeck et al., 2013; Huang, 2013; Huertas et al., 2015; Mattick et al., 2001; Ros-Chumillas et al., 2015; Valdramidis et al., 2008). We firmly believe that OEDs have several advantages with respect to uniform designs, but they must be illustrated with case studies before they are broadly accepted by the community (especially scientists without a strong background in statistics). This article serves that purpose, showing the drawbacks of uniform designs: lower precision for the same experimental effort, and the fact that they not ensure that increasing the number of sampling points reduces parameter uncertainty.</p>
<p>The last paragraph of the introduction has been largely rewritten including these remarks:</p>
<p>&#8220;</p>
<p>The model parameters of models used in predictive microbiology usually have a biological meaning. For instance, the D-value describes the treatment time required to reduce the microbial count a 90% (Bigelow, 1921). Model parameters estimated under certain conditions are commonly used to, for example, infer the effectiveness of a treatment (Mat&#233; et al., 2016; Ros-Chumillas et al., 2017). Therefore, in many situations, the objective of experiments designed in the context of predictive microbiology is not prediction but the estimation of model parameter with enough precisi&#243;n (standard deviation) that enables accurate inference. Despite the advances in OED, there are still some open questions when it comes to designing such experiments.  For instance, the number of sampling points is commonly decided based on previous experience. As a result, there is a high risk that the number of sampling points is excessive, leading to unnecessary experimental work, or too low, which would require posterior repetitions of the experiment. In this work, we explore the application of numerical techniques to reduce this uncertainty. We propose two complementary methodologies, the first one based on the properties of the FIM and the second one based on Monte Carlo simulations. Although both methods are usually applied to compare between different designs, here we illustrate how they can be used to aid in the decision process during the first stages of the experimental design. We describe their mathematical basis and illustrate how they can provide valuable information that may reduce the uncertainty of the experimental design (e.g. in the selection of the number of sampling points). For this, we analyze a case study related to dynamic microbial inactivation. Nevertheless, the applicability of these methods is not restricted to this case and could, in principle, be applied to any problem in the context of predictive microbiology. </p>
<p>&#8220;</p>
<p>- The adopted formulation of the penalty function to set a constraint on the sampling frequency requires clarification. I understand that a similar formulation was adopted in a previous publication by the same authors, but i) hybrid solvers can cope with linear inequality constraints in FIM-based OED; ii) the optimisation cost cannot be too high in the considered case (1D model with 2 parameters).</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer&#8217;s suggestion. In a previous investigation (Garre et al., 2018b), we tried different formulations of the optimization problem and we found that the addition of the penalty function provided feasible solutions which could not be improved by applying a final local search with a local method (i.e., interior point method) which handles non-linear constraints. In this research, we have used a global optimization method, as recommended by different authors to address this type of problem (e.g., Balsa-Canto et al. 2008). We also tried another global optimization method handling inequality constraints, the Improved Stochastic Ranking Evolution Strategy (ISRES), implemented in the nloptr R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nloptr/index.html" ns0:type="simple">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nloptr/index.html</ext-link>) and after much longer runs than those performed with MEIGO and the mentioned penalty function, the obtained solutions were worse than those presented in our work. We also used the Rsolnp method (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rsolnp/index.html" ns0:type="simple">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rsolnp/index.html</ext-link>), which is a general non-linear optimization method using augmented Lagrange multipliers and, again, the results did not outperformed those obtained with the proposed formulation/method. The best solutions were provided by the enhanced scatter search method implemented in MEIGO using a final local refinement with a direct search method based on hill climbing (DHC). The package bioOED referenced in our paper allows users to use MEIGO with its different options and local solvers to solve OED problems in predictive microbiology.</p>
<p>We are aware that we do not have a mathematical prove that the obtained solutions are optimal, but we obtain better solutions than other alternatives, we use the recommended type of solve for this type of problem, and we believe that the possible difference between the provided solutions and the mathematically optimal solutions is probably due to a matter of convergence tolerance in the decision variables and/or objective function. </p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that there is the possibility that a smarter mathematical formulation of the optimization problem exists. However, although the model is relatively simple, the optimization is done according to the position of each sampling point. Therefore, an experimental design with 18 sampling points has 18 decision variables. We believe that a deeper study of the optimization problem, although interesting from the point of view of optimization theory, would only have a small contribution to the research question (how the properties of the FIM and MC simulations can aid in experimental design) and would increase the complexity of the analysis.</p>
<p>- [Lines 167- 170]: E-criterion attempts to minimise the maximum uncertainty in parameter estimates (not the parameter with the highest error). In addition, the authors should clearly state which aspects of D-optimality meet &#8216;circumstances&#8217; in their study case.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer&#8217;s comment. We have referred to the E-criterion in the text to make the reader aware of the fact that there are other alternatives. However, a variety of criteria have been suggested for the quantification of the information observable using an experimental design (A-criterion, C-criterion, D-criterion, E-criterion, T-criterion, G-criterion, I-criterion&#8230;) and many of them even have modified version (e.g. the A-criterion) with better properties from the point of view of the optimization problem. As well as with the previous comment, we believe that a comparison between the designs identified using each one of the criteria listed, although very interesting from the point of view of experimental design theory, would only bring a small contribution to the research question analysed. Hence, it is left for future work. In any case, the R package bioOED with which the calculations can be reproduced, allows the user to switch between D and modified E-criterion to explore other possible designs.</p>
<p>According to the reviewer&#8217;s remarks and the paragraph has been rephrased including additional information:</p>
<p>&#8220;A popular alternative is the E-criterion, which tries to minimize the maximum uncertainty in parameter estimates (in the case studied here, the uncertainty of the parameter with the highest error) (Balsa-Canto et al., 2008). Because this article tries to illustrate how computational methods can be used to aid experimental design and because this criterion has already been applied in a similar problem (Garre et al., 2018b), this study is limited to the results of the D-criterion. A comparison between the precision of different designs is left for future work.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Among the mentioned limitations of the FIM-based approach, local validity in the parameter space (i.e. computations are performed in the neighbourhood of the a priori unknown optimal/true parameters values) is the most relevant. I could not find any reference to how the initial uncertainty in parameter estimates was accounted for. This is a crucial point for applicability of the outlined methods. The application of the methods cannot precede the acquisition of some experimental data.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer&#8217;s comment. The need for nominal parameters values is a known limitation of the approach to OED based on the FIM. We have used model parameters taken from the literature for experimental conditions similar to the ones considered in our study. This approach has also been applied in other articles that also studied OED in the context of predictive microbiology (Akkermans et al., 2018b, 2018a; Bernaerts et al., 2000; Garre et al., 2018b; Poschet et al., 2005; Stamati et al., 2016; van Derlinden et al., 2010; Versyck et al., 1999, 1997). Due to the availability of extensive reviews and databases of microbial inactivation (Baranyi and Tamplin, 2004; Doyle et al., 2001; Doyle and Mazzotta, 2000; van Asselt and Zwietering, 2006), approximate values of the model parameters can be found for most conditions.</p>
<p>In a practical setting, the experimental design could be updated after the first repetition. This approach, quite common in, for instance, systems biology, is usually not required in predictive microbiology, due to the lower dimensionality of the models.</p>
<p>In any case we find the reviewer remark very interesting and we will consider performing a new study based on global sensitivity analysis to guide predictive microbiologist in the uncommon cases where nominal values for the parameters cannot be found anywhere. </p>
<p>- An elusive comparison of the informative content of thermal profiles is presented. Due to the low dimensionality of the mathematical model, the simultaneous optimisation of i) number of sampling times, ii) their location and iii) the perturbation profile would have been feasible and of high interest.</p>
<p>See response to the first major comment. We agree with the reviewer that finding optimal temperature profiles for designing optimal experiments or in other tasks like process design and optimization is a very relevant engineering question. However, as mentioned above, the temperature profile in this context is crucial for biological aspects like the microorganism acclimation. In such cases, the model that best describes the microbial counts within a thermal inactivation process would be different, with a different number of parameters. We have preferred to let the temperature profile a as discrete given factor (i.e., by considering 3 different profiles which could have been extended to other commonly used in research or industry) to illustrate the main objective of the paper: OED + MC simulations is an effective methodology to select the sampling points in thermal microbial inactivation and get the maximum information.</p>
<p>- The conclusions drawn from the research provide limited insights and a more in depth analysis should be performed. It is intuitive that experience-based experimental schemes provide a lower bound of the performances of OED, otherwise we would not put effort in optimisation. The fact that one perturbation scheme results more informative than others is useful only if patterns identified support the extrapolation of &#8216;rules for informativeness&#8217;. Finally it seems obvious that data are not equally informative, so that increasing their cardinality might not convey additional information in uniform schemes.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer&#8217;s comment. She raises several objection that we will respond one by one.</p>
<p>We agree that experience-based are a lower bound for OED. That&#8217;s why we always try to include uniform designs as a baseline for comparison with the OED (the definition of an &#8220;experience-based&#8221; one can be researcher-dependent). We have found some patterns of perturbation, shown in Figure 2, that are dependent on the temperature profile and are stable with the number of sampling points. However, we have not included the shape of the thermal profile in those patterns due to the biological arguments we have given in our response to the previous comments.</p>
<p>Regarding the uniform design, an expert on experiment design may find this point obvious. But we believe that researchers with a background that is more focused on microbiology expect that increasing the number of sampling points would reduce the uncertainty in parameter estimates. Indeed, it is very rare for articles in predictive microbiology to justify the number of sampling points. In this research work we clearly illustrate that increasing the number of sampling points does not ensure that the uncertainty in parameter estimates is reduced. We could not find such result published before in the context of predictive microbiology and we believe that some researchers may find this point, at least, surprising. We believe this is an interesting research finding, which can encourage predictive microbiologists with a background in microbiology to apply OEDs.</p>
<p>Our goal with this work was to illustrate how computational tools (the properties of the FIM and Monte Carlo simulations) can aid in experimental design. It can be used to compare between different designs (optimal/uniform, as well as between different profiles) and to evaluate how increasing the number of sampling points affects uncertainty. The results show that for each thermal profile, there is an upper bound for the amount of information that can be extracted, so uncertainty cannot be reduced below a minimum. This is already an interesting result for predictive microbiology, where it is usually assumed that uncertainty can be reduced to zero if enough information (experimental data, in this case) is gathered. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increasing the number of sampling points may actually increase uncertainty when a uniform sampling scheme is used. Finally, we illustrate how Monte Carlo simulations can be used to decide the number of sampling points in an experiment (maximum standard deviation of the parameters). To date, that was done based on previous experience, so there was a high risk of taking too many or too few points.</p>
<p>We believe that these conclusions are relevant for predictive microbiology and that have enough merit to be published.</p>
