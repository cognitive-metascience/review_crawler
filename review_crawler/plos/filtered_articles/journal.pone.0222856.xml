<abstract>
<p>Immune responses have been mostly studied at a specific time in anuran species. However, time-changes related to immunomodulation associated with glucocorticoid (GC) alterations following stressors and GC treatment are complex. The present study describes time-related changes in immune response and corticosterone (CORT) plasma levels following restraint challenge, short, mid and long-term captivity, and CORT exogenous administration by transdermal application (TA) in <italic>Rhinella ornata</italic> toads. We observed increased neutrophil: lymphocyte ratios after restraint challenge and CORT TA, without changes following short and mid-term captivity. Plasma bacterial killing ability was sustained in all treatments, except long-term captivity, with decreased values after 90 days under such conditions. Phagocytic activity of peritoneal cells increased after mid-term captivity, and the phytohemagglutinin swelling response was impaired in those animals treated with CORT TA for 20 consecutive days. Plasma CORT levels increased or were sustained after restraint challenge (depending on initial values), decreased following mid and long-term captivity (for those animals showing high CORT in the field) and increased after 20 days of CORT TA. By performing assessments of time-changes in immune processes and CORT plasma levels in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic>, we demonstrate immuno-enhancing effects following restraint, short and mid-term stressors, while long-term stressors and CORT TA promoted immunosuppression in these toads.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stress-induced immunomodulation is complex and frequently associated with immune suppressive effects. However, recent studies have shown that changes in immune responses are mostly dependent on the stress duration and intensity, and can vary over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>]. While long-term stress usually results in immune suppressive effects, short-term stress can enhance the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>]. Meanwhile, glucocorticoids (GCs), one of the major mediators of the stress response, influence immune cell redistribution and immune function in several vertebrates, including amphibians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref003">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref007">7</xref>]. Leukocyte redistribution is associated with wound healing by increasing immune responsiveness in body compartments requiring immune protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref009">9</xref>]. As a result, this leukocyte redistribution is reflected as an increase in blood neutrophil: lymphocyte ratios (NLR), a common proxy of the stress response in both field and laboratory studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref008">8</xref>]. Recent studies have shown increased NLR following an array of stressors and GC treatment in several vertebrates, including anurans submitted to restraint challenge and corticosterone (CORT) treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref010">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Immune cellular components are strongly sensitive to stressors, being upregulated within hours by the acute stress response and GC exogenous administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref014">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref017">17</xref>]. Commonly observed immune-enhancement responses include changes in leukocyte trafficking, maturation, and augmentation of cell function, including: phagocytosis activity, and production of antibodies and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref018">18</xref>]. On the other hand, delayed wound healing, down-regulation of adaptive immunity, and anti-inflammatory actions are more pronounced days after stress exposure and GC treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref019">19</xref>]. Specifically in the context of regulation of the inflammatory response, the immunosuppressive effects of the GCs are important for the inflammatory resolution phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref005">5</xref>]. However, long-term stress and chronic GCs exposure and their inducing anti-inflammatory actions impair mounting of the inflammatory/innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>]. Although temporal patterns of stress-induced immunomodulation have been well-described for mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>], data for other vertebrates are still scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>In amphibians an array of stress protocols have been used in order to investigate stress-induced CORT changes, including restraint, captivity and exogenous CORT administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref020">20</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref027">27</xref>], with recent studies also investigating stress-induced immunomodulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref020">20</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref027">27</xref>]. Restraint and captivity stress-induced changes include increased CORT along with both immune- enhancing or suppressive effects in anurans, depending on the studied immune parameter, as well as variation in stress duration and intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref027">27</xref>]. The NLR, for example, increased following restraint without movement restriction, but even higher values were observed after restraint with movement restriction, indicating the NLR changes are correlated with intensity of the stressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref011">11</xref>]. Phagocytosis activity is also up-regulated following acute restraint and CORT exogenous application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref023">23</xref>]. Additionally, changes in cellular and non-cellular aspects of immune response are not synchronized following long-term captivity in toads, with down-regulation of phagocytic activity and bacterial killing ability (BKA) being observed at different time-points of captivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref028">28</xref>]. Although evidences of stress-induced immunomodulation in anurans has been provided, they are generally derived from different combinations of experimental protocols (i.e., restraint, captivity, hormonal exogenous administration), and immune parameters, such as, NLR, phagocytosis, BKA, phytohemaglutinin (PHA) swelling response, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref029">29</xref>]. Moreover, immune assessment has been usually performed in each of these experiments at single sampling time-points, and the studies were conducted with different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref029">29</xref>]. The multiplicity of experimental protocols, immune parameters and species used, along with measurements performed at single time-points after treatments, limit our understanding of the temporal patterns of interaction between response to stressors, CORT and immune responses in amphibians.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated time-related patterns of immunomodulation in response to short and long-term stressors (restraint and captivity) and exogenous CORT administration in a single toad species, <italic>Rhinella ornata</italic>. We hypothesized that exposure of toads to short-term stressors would generate immuno-enhancing effects, while exposure of toads to long-term stressors and daily CORT administration for 20 days would generate immunosuppression. In order to test these hypotheses, we measured time-related changes in CORT plasma levels, NLR, BKA, PHA swelling response and phagocytic activity from peritoneal and blood leukocytes in response to short-term restraint challenge (1 and 24 hours), short, mid and long-term captivity (7 days, 30 days, and 60 to 90 days, respectively), and CORT exogenous administration (transdermal application&#8211;TA for 20 days) in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> toads. We predicted: (1) Increased CORT plasma levels and NLR following restraint, short and long-term captivity and CORT TA; (2) Increased BKA and phagocytosis activity in response to short-term restraint and short-term captivity; (3) Decreased BKA, phagocytosis activity and PHA edema in response to long-term captivity maintenance and CORT TA; (4) mid-term captivity (30 days) would represent a transient period, when patterns of stress response of NLR, BKA and phagocytosis percentage (PP) would be less obvious.</p>

<p>Plasma CORT levels increased following restraint and CORT TA, but contrary to our prediction, decreased in response to short, mid and long-term captivity in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> toads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222856.t001">Table 1</xref>). These results indicate that restraint was perceived by these toads as a stressor, but they might be less sensitive to captivity maintenance. Moreover, CORT TA increased CORT plasma levels 1h after treatment and may have simulated the hormonal response to a repeated stressor. As we expected, NLR increased after restraint and peritoneal PP showed increased values following mid-term captivity, indicating an immune enhancing effect during this period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222856.t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, BKA and PHA edema were impaired after long-term captivity and CORT TA, which could be associated with chronic stress and GC-induced immunosuppressive effects, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222856.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>As expected, for males showing low CORT at 0h, restraint increased CORT plasma levels, as previously described for anurans including <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref030">30</xref>]. Additionally, our results showed maximum CORT values 1h of after restraint compared to 24h, which might indicate negative feedback of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal-interrenal axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref031">31</xref>]. Meanwhile, for the individuals in the field displaying high baseline CORT, we observed a tendency to decrease CORT plasma levels following 24h restraint. These toads were already displaying high CORT in the field probably due to reproductive behavior (calling activity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref027">27</xref>], precluding the assessment of increased CORT values 24h post-restraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref011">11</xref>]. Moreover, the trend to decreased CORT 24h post-restraint in these toads also corroborates the observation that the peak of GC release in response to restraint occurs before 24h of exposure to this stressor. <italic>Rhinella ornata</italic> toads that were engaged in calling activity and displayed high CORT in the field also showed decreased CORT plasma levels in response to captivity maintenance, which could be associated with the interruption of vocal behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref032">32</xref>]. In addition, neither short nor long-term captivity elicited NLR changes in these toads. The absence of response in NLR along with low CORT plasma levels, suggest that these <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> males were less affected by captivity than males from other species in the same genus exposed to captivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref028">28</xref>]. We also described changes in CORT plasma levels following CORT TA, with increased CORT in the experimental group 14 times higher than the control group after 20 consecutive days of CORT TA. Although CORT plasma levels after CORT TA were extremely high in the experimental group (348 &#177; 54ng/ml, mean &#177; standard error), high CORT levels (282 &#177; 52ng/ml, mean &#177; standard error) were reported for this same species following severe dehydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref013">13</xref>], evidencing these animals are physiologically able to reach such high circulating CORT levels.</p>
<p>Increased NLR was observed after restraint challenge (24h) and submission to the CORT TA experiment (both control and experimental groups) for 20 days. Additionally, in CORT TA experiment, we did not find differences between control and CORT group, which might indicate that daily manipulation itself is a stressor for <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic>. Increased NLR following restraint challenge and post-CORT TA were reported for <italic>Rhinella</italic> toads, including <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref012">12</xref>]. Increased NLR was also described for salamanders 50h post-capture following both ACTH and saline injection, even with a concomitant decrease in CORT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref033">33</xref>]. Accordingly, the increased NLR observed in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> following restraint challenge and 20 days post-TA was not associated with changes in CORT, even considering that TA-induced increase in CORT plasma levels was so prominent. Besides the prominent increase in CORT plasma levels resulting from CORT TA, toads from the control group also showed a tendency to increase CORT throughout the experiment. This tendency might indicate that daily manipulation (box opening and water removal and return) could represent a stressor for all groups, resulting in increased NLR for both control and CORT TA groups. In general, although we observed both increased CORT plasma levels and NLR in response to the set of different stressors applied in the present study, these response variables could not be easily associated, as already observed in other contexts and study models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate preserved BKA in almost all treatments (restraint, short and mid-term captivity and TA) except after long-term captivity, given that a reduction in values was observed in the 90<sup>th</sup> day of captivity maintenance. Plasma BKA is an innate, non-cellular immune response mediated through the complement system and lysozymes, both of which promote lysis of invading microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref035">35</xref>]. Studies conducted in birds, reptiles and mammals have demonstrated both acute and/or prolonged regulation of BKA-associated proteins following stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref036">36</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref039">39</xref>]. In amphibians, impaired BKA has been described following acute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref023">23</xref>] and long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref028">28</xref>] stressors and GCs exogenous treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref021">21</xref>]. However, temporal patterns of BKA stress-associated responses are diverse. Decreased BKA following long-term captivity was transient for <italic>R</italic>. <italic>schneideri</italic>, but sustained for <italic>R</italic>. <italic>icterica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref028">28</xref>]. The absence of changes in response to most of the short and mid-term stressors and CORT treatment, along with decreased values only after long-term captivity maintenance, suggest that BKA presents robust immune mediators in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> toads.</p>
<p>Regarding immune cellular activity, we did not observe changes in blood PP 1h and 24h after restraint in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic>. In contrast, increased phagocytosis 13h after restraint was described in another <italic>Rhinella</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref023">23</xref>]. Thus, the lack of response in PP 1 and 24h post restraint could indicate these time points are ideal for ascertaining how restraint influences any blood phagocytosis alterations in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> toads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>]. Meanwhile, phagocytosis of peritoneal cells was affected by mid-term captivity, with increased mean values for PP on the 30<sup>th</sup> day. Up-regulation of immune responses following stressors, including phagocytic activity, is often observed in several vertebrates, but in a context of acute stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref041">41</xref>]. Results of phagocytic stress-driven changes are unclear as studies have presented conflicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref028">28</xref>]. Meanwhile, increased phagocytosis was previously observed in response to 13h restraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref023">23</xref>] and after a month following CORT treatments, such as CORT TA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref012">12</xref>], capsule implant and immersion in CORT-treated water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref004">4</xref>]. Our study showed maximum values for PP on the 30<sup>th</sup> day compared to the 7<sup>th</sup> and 90<sup>th</sup> day in captivity. Moreover, mean CORT values were maximum on the 30<sup>th</sup> day compared to the other days in captivity, which could be associated with the increased phagocytic activity following mid-term captivity. Specifically Falso et al. (2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref004">4</xref>], found that CORT treatment was associated with increased phagocytosis and increased neutrophil concentration in the blood (a parameter not measured in our captivity experiment&#8211;field to 90 days), along with high CORT levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref004">4</xref>]. These results indicate a complex relationship between stress and immunity, and the importance in accounting for time-related changes of distinct branches of immune system in response to a stress challenge in anurans.</p>
<p>The inflammatory response, measured as PHA relative edema, was affected by the CORT TA at both 12h and 24h in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> toads. The inflammatory and cell-mediated immune response is strongly associated with stress intensity (high CORT and catecholamine levels) and duration (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>]). While an acute increase in CORT stimulates the inflammatory response, persistent GCs elevations suppress it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref017">17</xref>]. The inflammatory response can be suppressed at multiple levels, including the inhibition of leukocyte recruitment or reduced leukocyte pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref016">16</xref>]. In amphibians, chronic treatment with high doses of CORT delays cutaneous wound healing in salamanders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref042">42</xref>] and frogs (Madelaire et al., unpublished data). Therefore, the acute daily increase in CORT plasma levels, by CORT TA, could have promoted an anti-inflammatory effect in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> toads, a common effect following chronical or several acute elevations of GCs in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref002">2</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, different time-related trajectories for CORT plasma levels and immune parameters were described in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> toads following stressors and CORT TA. Since CORT levels were sustained (for those animals with low levels in the field) or decreased (for those individuals displaying high levels in the field) in response to short and mid-term captivity, along with no changes in BKA and NLR, it appears that captivity for a 30 days does not represent a stressor for this species. However, mid and long-term captivity increased phagocytosis activity of peritoneal cells in the 30<sup>th</sup> and decreased BKA in the 90<sup>th</sup> day, respectively, indicating captivity promotes immune changes, with captivity maintenance for 90 days potentially representing a low-intensity stress condition. In the meantime, CORT changes along with increased NLR indicate a stress response following restraint challenge. Moreover, increased CORT associated with a reduction in PHA swelling response after 20 consecutive days of CORT TA, indicate a chronic stress situation for <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic>. Together, these results demonstrate immuno-enhancing effects following restraint, short and mid-term stressors, while long-term stressors and CORT administration promoted immunosuppression. Additionally, our results indicate cellular immunity are more responsive to stressors and high CORT levels induced by CORT TA than non-cellular immune response in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic> toads. Therefore, we encourage researchers working within the ecoimmunology area, at the field and under laboratory conditions, to conduct studies that include a number of different stress protocols and sampling at multiple time-points, to better understand patterns of stress-related immunomodulation in vertebrates.</p>

<title>Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) swelling assay</title>
<p>The PHA challenge was performed in order to assess the inflammatory response 24h after the TA (Exp. 6) in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ornata</italic>, according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref045">45</xref>]. Specifically, the hind fleshy base of the right foot was injected with 10ul of PHA (20 mg PHA [Sigma L8754]/ml sterile saline solution) using a 10 ul glass syringe and 30Gx1/2&#8243; needle. The hind fleshy base of the left foot of the same animal was injected with 10 ul of sterile saline solution, as a control. The thickness of each injected hind fleshy base of each animal was measured with a thickness gauge (Digimess, accuracy 0.01 mm) before, 12 and 24h after PHA and saline injections. Measurements consisted of three successive thickness measurements. At each time point, three successive measurements of thickness were taken, with the mean of these values was used in analysis. The swelling in response to PHA and saline was calculated from the proportional change in foot thickness before, 12 and 24h after injection. The relative swelling was considered as the thickness in 12 or 24 hours divided by initial thickness multiplied by 100. The PHA relative edema was calculated as the PHA relative swelling minus the saline relative swelling.</p>
<p>At the end of the 24h swelling measurement, individuals were euthanized with an intraperitoneal injection (75mg/kg) of sodium thiopental (Thiopenthax&#174;) solution (25mg/ml).</p>

<title>Corticosterone assays</title>
<p>Steroid hormones were initially extracted with ether according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222856.ref021">21</xref>].

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics 22. Normality of all data were assessed via the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. With the exception of BKA in restraint challenge and captivity treatments, all variables were normal.</p>
<p>Sets of ANCOVAs for independent or repeated measures (as applicable for each set of data, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222856.t002">Table 2</xref>) were used to investigate the effect of each experiment (1&#8211;6: Restraint challenge, Captivity and TA) on studied variables. CORT, NLR, BKA, PHA relative edema and PP were used as dependent variables, body mass and snout-vent length as co-variables and each treatment and/or time as a factor. Unstandardized residuals of a linear regression of body mass as a function of snout-vent length were used as body index and also included as co-variable in the ANCOVAs.</p>
<p>For the dependent variables not significantly affected by body mass, snout-vent length and body index a set of ANOVAs was then performed with treatment (Experiment 2: Restraint hour [0, 1, 24h]; Experiment 5: captivity days [field, 7, 30, 60, 90]; or Experiment 6: TA group [control, placebo, experimental]) as factor. The ANOVAs were followed by tests for mean multiple comparisons with Bonferroni adjustments. Paired comparisons with Student-t test were performed for the dependent variables not significantly affected by body mass in the experiments with only two comparisons (Experiment 1: Restraint [baseline <italic>vs</italic>. 24h post restraint]; Experiment 3 and 4: captivity [field <italic>vs</italic>. 7 days and field <italic>vs</italic>. 30 days]). Since BKA showed absence of normality, we used the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test, which is a non-parametric test.</p>

<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: 307: Please explain why the sampling dates (years) are spreaded so much ?</p>
<p>308: Why sampling was done across different locations ?</p>
<p>313: I can see ethics approval for 2013 and 2016 only. Did this ethics approval cover the 2018 sampling as well ?</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This study examines temporal changes in immune responses and plasma corticosterone levels following restraint, captivity, and corticosterone administration in toads. Given the multiple immune responses that were measured (neutrophil: lymphocyte ratios, plasma bacterial killing ability, phagocytic activity of peritoneal cells, and phytohemagglutinin swelling response) and the various time frames in which they were measured, this study represents one of the most thorough studies on the topic in amphibians. Overall, the results indicate that short term stress enhances immune function while long-term stress suppresses immune function. The paper is well written and the introduction and results are clear and well thought out. I only have a few comments/questions that are specified below:</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Line 316. Correct &#8220;toads were located by visually and captured by hand&#8221;.</p>
<p>The relationship between body mass and CORT was examined but was body size measured? I&#8217;m wondering how the authors accounted for differences in mass that were attributable to size. For example, there was no relationship between body mass and CORT (Line 359 and elsewhere) but would it be better to examine body condition estimates that factor in size differences?</p>
<p>Line 451. How many CORT assays were run? Were the assays validated for this species?</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Line 99. Body mass was not manipulated so it would be better to state that there was no relationship between body mass and the measured variables. What was the direction of the relationship with PHA?</p>
<p>Line 102. How were toads with high and low initial CORT levels delineated (i.e., how did you determine the cutoff point)?</p>
<p>Line 111. Rephrase to state that CORT levels were 14 times higher in TA-treated toads compared to controls.</p>
<p>CORT levels increased dramatically in TA-treated toads (Fig 1E). The authors mention the upper limits of CORT in this species following severe dehydration (line 221), but can the authors comment about the natural range of CORT levels and whether the effects on immune responses (especially PHA measures shown in Fig. 4C) actually occur within the natural range of CORT levels (i.e., CORT levels in the TA treatment group is still quite a bit higher than the upper limits reported)?</p>
<p>Line 125. Of the 9 individuals wherein NLR was measured after constraint (Fig. 2A), do these represent individuals that showed an increase or decrease in CORT levels during constraint (see Fig. 1 A and B)?</p>
<p>**********</p>
