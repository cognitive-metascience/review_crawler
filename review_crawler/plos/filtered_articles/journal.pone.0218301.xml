<abstract>
<p><italic>Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae</italic> is a wasp that parasitizes and host-feeds on pupae of the invasive spotted-wing drosophila (SWD, <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic>). Few studies have addressed interactions between these two species and little is known about the potential of this parasitoid as a biocontrol agent of SWD and the different variables that may affect it. Here, we investigated the impact of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on life-history traits of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic>. Both constant (entire adulthood) and limited (30 minutes) supplies of water + honey, honey, or host increased parasitoid survival compared to controls (water or fasting). Water + honey caused the highest parasitoid survivals (35&#8211;60 days), independent of supply period, sex, and host availability. Females were intrinsically more resistant to water- and honey-deprivation than males, and host-feeding elevated such resistance even higher. Constant honey supply (either with or without water) supported the highest host-killing capacities (= capacity to kill hosts) (<italic>ca</italic>. 600 SWD pupae/wasp). However, in young females (4&#8211;9 days old), the impact of honey availability (with or without water) was insignificant while water deprivation (either with or without honey) caused the highest host-killing potential. This indicates that although sugar becomes a critical nutritional resource as females age, young females depend more on water than sugar to reproduce. Neither water nor honey affected the sex ratio of young females, but when we considered the entire adulthood, the availability of honey caused the lowest proportion of females (0.50), independent of water availability. Neither water nor honey affected parasitoid emergence rate (0.97), independent of female age. Based on survival and host-killing capacity, we conclude that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> has a tremendous biocontrol potential against SWD. Both limited and constant supply of water, sugar, and host increase parasitoid survival, while constant supply of water and/or honey enhance its host-killing potential and decrease sex ratio depending on maternal age.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since 2008, spotted-wing drosophila (SWD), <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> (Diptera: Drosophilidae), has become a key pest of small fruits and cherries in the Americas and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref001">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref003">3</xref>]. The fly is native to southeast Asia and was first detected in North America (California) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref004">4</xref>] and Europe (Italy and Spain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref005">5</xref>] in 2008, and in South America (Brazil) in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref006">6</xref>]. Management relies greatly on broad-spectrum insecticides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref008">8</xref>] and cultural tactics such as early/timely harvest and sanitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref009">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref011">11</xref>]. However, these approaches display limited efficacy, and are not environmentally or economically sustainable. For these reasons, there is a need for alternative control strategies that can be incorporated into a holistic integrated pest management (IPM) program for SWD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref012">12</xref>]. Biological control provides such an alternative as it is relatively safe and compatible with other forms of pest control, constituting one of the main pillars of most IPM programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref014">14</xref>]. In the context of SWD, parasitic wasps are expected to play a key role in reducing field populations of this fly pest in newly invaded areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref015">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Besides causing reproductive effects that often culminate with host death (i.e., oviposition and host-feeding), parasitoids can negatively affect their hosts in ways that do not contribute to parasitoids&#8217; current or future reproduction. This is known as non-reproductive effects and they include host mutilation, pseudoparasitism, and aborted parasitism, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref018">18</xref>]. Additionally, because of the low availability of food (e.g., hosts and/or sugars) and its spatial and temporal variability in the field, determining the effects of single feeding events in parasitoids is critical for a better understanding of their nutritional needs and hence the frequency at which they need to forage for food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae</italic> Rondani (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g001">Fig 1</xref>) is a solitary idiobiont synovigenic ectoparasitic wasp that attacks pupae of many fly (Diptera) species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref022">22</xref>], including SWD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref023">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref025">25</xref>]. Its use as a natural enemy of dipterous pests has been evaluated in various countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref026">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref028">28</xref>]. In Europe and the U.S., <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> is amongst the only two parasitoid species that have been naturally found to successfully attack and kill SWD in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref016">16</xref>]. Such natural occurrence suggests that this parasitoid is already adapted to the new host and has the potential to succeed in biological control programs of SWD in these invaded areas. Nevertheless, research exploring the interaction between <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> and SWD is limited, and very little is known about the impact of intrinsic (e.g., sex, age) and extrinsic (e.g., nutritional resources) factors on such interaction.</p>

<p>Thorough review on the effects of carbohydrate supply on various life-history traits of hymenopteran parasitoids have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref029">29</xref>]. Compared to sugars, the impact of water on the biology of parasitic wasps has received far less attention. Water is considered an essential nutrient for insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref031">31</xref>] and must be ingested frequently to compensate for dehydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref033">33</xref>]. In parasitic wasps, water is seldom considered to have any effect on survival or reproduction, and little is known about whether parasitoids forage for free water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref034">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref040">40</xref>]. By practicing host-feeding a parasitoid can access nutrients for parasitoid maintenance, egg production, or both, including water and sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref042">42</xref>]. In <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic>, host-feeding has been observed not only on pupae of SWD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref043">43</xref>], but also on pupae of the housefly (<italic>Musca domestica</italic> L.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref026">26</xref>], and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Meigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref044">44</xref>]. In SWD, host-feeding by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> can kill the host pupa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref043">43</xref>]. When parasitizing pupae of the housefly, females of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> that were offered a constant supply of honey had greater longevity, offspring production, and sex ratio (i.e., proportion of female offspring) than females fed a water-only diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref036">36</xref>]. Honey extends longevity in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> depending on SWD pupae and water availability, but it has no effect on the reproduction of young females (4&#8211;8 days old). These females seek and benefit from ingesting free water, and they host-feed on SWD pupae as a water-intake strategy. Host-feeding extends their longevity, and increased host-feeding lead to greater offspring production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref043">43</xref>]. Despite the studies on young females, comprehensive descriptions of the reproductive and non-reproductive effects of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> on SWD pupae throughout the parasitoid&#8217;s entire life span are lacking. Measuring both effects is crucial for better understanding the full host-killing potential of the parasitoid against this invasive pest. Moreover, determining how nutrition affect such potential will indicate the parasitoid&#8217;s water and food needs and may offer insights on habitat manipulation strategies.</p>
<p>In this study we investigated the impact of sex, age, and nutritional resources on the biology of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> reared on SWD. We hypothesized that water, honey, and host availability would affect the parasitoid&#8217;s fecundity, emergence rate, sex ratio, host-feeding, and non-reproductive effects on SWD in a sex- and age-dependent manner. Additionally, we hypothesized that the impact of a limited (single event) and constant supply of those nutritional resources would increase the survival curves of adult parasitoids. We found that both a limited and constant availability of water, honey, and host increase the survival of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> compared to starved controls, and that females have tremendous survival and killing potential against SWD even in periods of water and sugar scarcity. By comparing data collected throughout the entire lifespan with that of early adulthood we show that, as opposed to water, sugar is not a critical resource for young <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic>, but its relevance to the parasitoid&#8217;s host killing capacity and offspring sex ratio becomes evident as females age.</p>

In host absence, both female and male <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> receiving honey displayed the second highest survival curve, followed by water and fasting, which did not significantly differ from each other. Females fed honey alone showed much greater survival than their male counterparts (P = 0.0027), but such difference became insignificant when the adults were offered water + honey (P = 0.2454) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218301.s001">S1 Table</xref>). In host presence, no significant differences were found among survival of females offered the water, honey, and fasting treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g002">Fig 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218301.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Host presence resulted in significantly lower survival curves than host absence in the honey (P = 0.0074) and water + honey (P = 0.0107) treatments. Conversely, host presence significantly increased survival compared to host absence in the water (P&lt;0.0001) and fasting (P&lt;0.0001) treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g002">Fig 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218301.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The survival curves of host-provided females were either higher (water: P&lt;0.0001, fasting: P&lt;0.0001) or similar (honey, P = 0.1843) to those of males, with exception to water + honey where females had lower curves than males (P = 0.0019) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218301.s001">S1 Table</xref>). As long as a honey source was available, the survival curves of host-deprived females were either higher (honey: P = 0.0027), or similar (water + honey: P = 0.2454) to those of males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218301.s001">S1 Table</xref>).

<p>The parasitism rates of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> on SWD pupae were highest at 3&#8211;12 days old (the first 10 days of the study). Then, parasitism rates consistently declined independent of the diet. A steeper decline was however observed in the water and fasting diets compared to the other treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g003">Fig 3a and 3b</xref>). The parasitism capacity of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> females was completely exhausted at ages <italic>ca</italic>. 26 (fasting), 31 (water), 35 (honey), and 40 (water + honey). The likelihood of a wasp to be found alive at each of those ages was 48, 28, 40, and 40%, respectively, but it declined to zero <italic>ca</italic>. 3&#8211;11 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g002">Fig 2b</xref>). When we considered the entire adulthood of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> females, honey provision strongly increased fecundity compared to honey deprivation, independent of water availability (P&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0218301.t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g004">Fig 4a</xref>).

Separating the latter two mortality factors when a SWD pupa is dissected can be very tricky and in this study we were unable to do so accurately.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sex can determine a parasitoid&#8217;s lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref045">45</xref>], especially when males and females differ in the way they allocate nutritional resources to survival and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref046">46</xref>]. In our study, the impact of water and honey supply on adult <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> was similar (but yet different) between males and females. For example, when observed separately, both sexes were highly resilient in terms of survival. Offered water + honey they lived for up to 72&#8211;79 days, and even those individuals that were kept in complete starvation lived for 6&#8211;11 days. This lifespan is long relative to other parasitoid species and to a Chinese population of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> which under starvation only lived for 2.7 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref040">40</xref>]. Water + honey caused the highest survival curves, while water alone and fasting produced the lowest ones, independent of sex. However, by comparing survival curves between males and females we found that overall females live either same or longer than males, especially when water or sugars are scarce. First, honey-fed, host-deprived females survived better than males when water was scarce, but such a difference was diluted when water was offered, meaning that males are inherently more sensitive to water deprivation than females. Second, honey-deprived, host-provided females survived much better than males, but such advantage was suppressed when honey was supplied, i.e., males are more sensitive and hence more dependent on alternative sources of sugars than females. Taken together, these findings indicate that females are more likely to survive periods of water and sugar scarcity in the field than males, not only because females were intrinsically less sensitive to shortage of those resources, but also because females can supplement their nutritional needs with host-feeding.</p>
<p>It was clear that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic>&#8217;s survival was highly influenced by both limited and constant supply of water and honey, especially when hosts were not available. The impact of water, honey, and host availability on female survival was very consistent between the constant and limited supply experiments (assays #1 and #2, respectively). Such consistency attests that feeding on water, sugars, and hosts have both immediate and cumulative benefits on the adult parasitoids. A single bout of feeding on those resources was enough to extend female lifespan by 1.2&#8211;2.1 days relative to starved individuals, likely more than enough time for the wasps to find a next meal. Curiously, a small fraction of those females (0.5&#8211;1%) lived for 17&#8211;19 days following a single (30-minute) feeding bout on water + honey, honey, or host. This is 3x longer than the majority of their counterparts that were fed the same diets, highlighting important phenotypical plasticity regarding nutritional requirements in this parasitoid species, which may contribute to the reestablishment of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic>&#8217;s populations in the field even after extended periods of food scarcity. These findings indicate that both starvation and dehydration strongly reduce parasitoid survival, hence <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> must periodically search for sources of water and food in the field. Because foraging strategies are under strong selection pressure to minimize the risks to survival and maximize the nutrient gain from feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref047">47</xref>], it is likely that the wasps will prefer sources where both water and sugars are combined in an ideal proportion to optimize foraging. Studies exploring the response of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> to different concentrations of sugars could offer insights on the parasitoid&#8217;s sugar-water ratio preferences.</p>
<p>Our data indicates that female <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> showed a tremendous killing potential against SWD. A single female wasp was capable of attacking between <italic>ca</italic>. 440 and <italic>ca</italic>. 600 SWD pupae throughout her lifespan, depending on diet. Such high killing potential was achieved through a combination of <italic>ca</italic>. 75% parasitism and <italic>ca</italic>. 25% miscellaneous attack (i.e., host-feeding, mutilation, pseudoparasitism, and aborted parasitism). These data were achieved under controlled and optimal conditions in laboratory experiments, but they nevertheless indicate the potential impacts of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> on SWD populations. A constant supply of honey led to the highest parasitism and miscellaneous attack rates independent of water availability, showing that sugar plays a key role in the total (i.e., entire adulthood) host-killing capacity of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic>. Curiously, such sugar effect was not observed in young females (4&#8211;9 days old). At this age, water (and not honey) was the critical factor affecting parasitism and miscellaneous attack as both rates were highest in water-deprived as opposed to water-fed individuals. We previously showed that water deprivation results in a significant increase in the host-killing capacity of young <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref043">43</xref>]. The current study, however, shows different host-killing results between early and entire adulthood, indicating that the water and sugar needs of adult <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> females vary over their lifespan. In other words, our data in the current study demonstrates that females depend less on water and more on sugars for reproduction as they age. It should be noted, however, that an adequate supply of water + honey produced higher survival curves than any other diet, including honey alone. This finding suggests that even though the importance of water for parasitoid host-killing capacity decreases with the wasp&#8217;s age, water can still be considered an important resource to parasitoid survival throughout its lifespan.</p>
<p>At least one third of all females exhausted their parasitism capacity many days before death, independent of water and sugar availability. Meanwhile, miscellaneous attack clearly rose, indicating that parasitism cessation was attributed to a lack of mature eggs rather than an inability to seek and drill hosts (i.e., exhaustion of maintenance energy). Fasted and water-fed females were the first ones to end parasitism, followed by wasps fed honey and water + honey, which is consistent not only with the survival curves, but also with the total (entire adulthood) fecundity and miscellaneous attack. The rise of miscellaneous attack as the wasps aged contributed to the maintenance of a consistent host-killing potential despite the parasitoid&#8217;s declining fecundity. This finding seems plausible if we consider that (1) females survived on average 10&#8211;11 days without any food, (2) host-feeding plays a major role in miscellaneous attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref043">43</xref>], and (3) the hemolymph of each SWD pupa extended female survival by 1.3 day. In other words, as females got older, they exhausted their nutritional reserves and thus increased host-feeding (and hence miscellaneous attack) as a means to compensate for the nutritional loss. Host-feeding increment as a function of parasitoid age has already been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref048">48</xref>]. However, simply increasing host-feeding as a means to access nutritional resources and extend longevity does not explain such a high increment in miscellaneous attack. This is because, as previously explained, a single SWD pupa was enough to extend a female&#8217;s lifespan by more than one day, while the increment in miscellaneous attack was elevated from <italic>ca</italic>. four pupae/day in females aged 15 days to <italic>ca</italic>. 12 pupae/day in females aged 30 days. Hence, nonreproductive effects such as mutilation, pseudoparasitism, and aborted parasitism, which can cause host death without contributing to current or future reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref018">18</xref>], must have played a major role in such increment. It is really interesting to observe that even though <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic>&#8217;s capacity of producing offspring declines or is even exhausted, the parasitoid still seeks out, exploit, and kill hosts thus contributing to biological control of SWD.</p>
<p>Determining where parasitoids invest the nutrients acquired from host-feeding contributes to answering one of the main questions regarding the reproductive success of parasitoids: the trade-off between current and future reproduction (i.e., to use a host to produce an offspring or to host-feed, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref048">48</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref050">50</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> practice concurrent host-feeding (i.e., use the same host for both egg-laying and host-feeding) and that host-feeding by a newly-emerged female has no cost to her offspring neither in terms of survivorship nor size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref044">44</xref>], suggesting that there is no trade-off between current and future reproduction for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic>. Indeed, our results support such hypothesis since host-feeding by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> on SWD pupae was increased by water deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref043">43</xref>] while offspring emergence was not (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g004">4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g005">5c</xref>), i.e., host-feeding has no effect on parasitoid offspring survivorship. However, advanced age and dehydration resulted in an increase in the rate and time invested in host-feeding, as well as the amount of consumed hemolymph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref048">48</xref>], lowering the rate of emergence of parasitoid offspring (Bezerra Da Silva et al., unpublished data). Hence, the trade-off between current and future two reproduction can be a constraint for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> depending on maternal age and nutritional status. Because host-feeding provides females of this species with nutrients for both reproduction and adult maintenance (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g002">2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g003">3a, 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g004">4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g005">5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218301.g006">6</xref>), then both the egg load and remaining life time of a female will dictate whether she uses a SWD pupa to produce an offspring or to host-feed.</p>
<p>When provided with water + honey, each parasitoid was able to parasitize 438 SWD pupae throughout a 36-day lifespan, with fecundity smoothly declining as wasps aged. These results very much differ from those reported by Rossi Stacconi et al. (2015), where each honey-water-fed female of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> parasitized only 78 SWD pupae throughout its lifetime of just 22 days, with a sharp decline in parasitism capacity just before death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref051">51</xref>]. Even though the two studies maintained the wasps in very similar climatic conditions, the daily host supply regime differed. We offered 30 hosts per day, compared to 5 in Rossi Stacconi et al 2015. This methodological divergence likely resulted in the striking differences in total fecundity and pattern of parasitism exhaustion between the studies, but it does not explain the difference regarding lifespan. Because there is a trade-off between reproduction and survival, with investment in reproduction often reducing parasitoid survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref052">52</xref>], and the investment in this activity was 5.5x higher in our study than in Rossi Stacconi et al., it is surprising that the former reports a much greater survival than the latter.</p>
<p>The rate of emergence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> was nearly 100%, independent of the diet and female age. This implies that pupae of SWD can be considered highly suitable as hosts for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic>, especially relative to other fly species such as <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic>, <italic>Bactrocera latifrons</italic>, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cucurbitae</italic>, and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>domestica</italic>, which supported adult parasitoid emergence ranging from 35 to a maximum of 85% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref053">53</xref>]. In our study, the high emergence rates throughout female lifespan independent of diet also suggest that neither the nutritional status nor the age of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> females affect their ability to lay viable eggs, as has been suggested for other parasitoid species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref055">55</xref>]. Our results should be considered with parsimony however, because even though dead larvae and pupae of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> were easily spotted upon dissection, the same was not true for eggs due to their small size, translucid color, and dehydrated state. Hence, there is a chance that at least part of the high emergence rates observed in our study is an overestimation. As opposed to emergence rate, the impact of female age on offspring sex ratio was very clear, because the proportion of female offspring consistently declined starting in mothers aged <italic>ca</italic>. 10 days, independent of diet. Nevertheless, such decline was even stronger in honey-fed wasps in comparison to their honey-deprived counterparts, showing that sugar availability to mothers did have an effect on offspring sex ratio. Both maternal age and diet are known to affect the offspring sex ratios in parasitic wasps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref056">56</xref>]. But because in our study the effect of honey on offspring sex ratio was observed exclusively when we considered the entire adulthood (i.e., not observed in young females), and also because honey-fed wasps were more fecund than wasps deprived of honey, it is clear that the effect of sugar on offspring sex ratio is related to maternal age instead of their diets. These females mated during the first 2 days following emergence but were then secluded from day 3. Under these conditions, females lacked an opportunity to re-mate and thus replenish their sperm storage as egg laying took place. By being more fecund (i.e., laying more eggs), water + honey- and honey-fed females had greater opportunities to deplete sperm storage, consequently producing proportionally fewer females than sugar-deprived parasitoids (water and fasting). These findings indicate that females of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> need to re-mate multiple times throughout their adulthood if they are to produce female offspring, independent of their nutritional status, especially if they are highly prolific. In laboratory colonies and mass rearing, this means that fertile males should be present and mate with females throughout their lifetime if the foundresses are going to be kept for longer than 10 days following emergence. In the field, it is likely that prolific females will invest time and energy in re-mating as they age and their sperm storage is depleted.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> is long-lived and can significantly contribute towards SWD biocontrol through a combination of parasitism and miscellaneous attack (host-feeding, mutilation, pseudoparasitism, and aborted parasitism). We showed that limited and constant supplies of water and honey affect the survival of male and female wasps, as well as their parasitism capacity, sex ratio, and miscellaneous attack, with clear consequences for SWD mortality. Males are more sensitive to water and sugar scarcity than females. In the absence of water and sugars, females of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> can host-feed and rely exclusively on pupae of SWD to extensively extend their survival and increase their parasitism capacity. Even a single bout of feeding on hosts, sugar, and especially on both water and sugar, significantly extended the wasp&#8217;s survival. Constant supplies of water and sugars in an environment with no hosts can result in survival of up to 72 days, allowing maintenance of parasitoid populations and resumed parasitism when hosts once again become available. But even if none of those resources are available, both males and females can survive for many days under complete starvation. Taken together, these characteristics demonstrate the high resilience, adaptibility and biocontrol potential of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> against SWD, proving their increased likelihood of surviving unfavorable periods of water, food, and host scarcity in both the laboratory and field. These findings open many opportunities for additional research.

The SWD colonies were started from insects kindly provided by the USDA-ARS (Corvallis, OR, USA).

Adult parasitoids were kept in Bugdorm mesh cages (32.5x32.5x32.5 cm) (Bioquip Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA), fed streaks of honey on a Petri dish, and offered a pint container with a sponge soaked in de-ionized water.

Using a fine camel brush and de-ionized water, the 30 pupae were carefully attached to a piece of paper towel (2 x 2 cm) and set aside to dry for 1h at room temperature. Only then the pupae-carrying paper pieces were offered to the wasps. The numbers of replicates respectively for water, honey, water + honey, and fasting were 10, 8, 9, and 8 for males; 13, 14, 16, and 10 for females in host absence; and 11, 14, 10, and 12 for females in host presence. Each replicate was formed by one mated individual wasp. Daily, 5&#8211;8 paper towel pieces (N = 262 pieces for the entire experiment), each carrying 30 SWD pupae, were randomly selected to serve as an unexposed control, i.e., to never be offered to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> and thus allow assessment of the natural SWD mortality. These pupae were held under the same conditions as the parasitoid-exposed pupae. To control for potential differences in the relative humidity among treatments that were water provided (1, 3, 5, and 7) and water deprived (2, 4, 6, and 8), the same water source was provided within all tubes independent of treatment. However, for the water-deprived treatments, the tip of the Eppendorf tube was covered with a screen cap to prevent wasps from reaching the moistened paper while still allowing vaporized moisture to dissipate within the tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>Each day, the 30 parasitoid-exposed SWD pupae from each tube (treatments 5&#8211;8) were replaced by 30 fresh pupae and parasitoid mortality was recorded. Water and honey were resupplied as needed. The parasitoid exposed pupae were transferred to a new tube and kept in the climate-controlled chamber until adult emergence (24.1&#177;0.4&#176;C, 62&#177;8% R.H., and 14:10 L:D photoperiod). Emerged flies and parasitoids were counted under the stereomicroscope (Leica S8AP0, Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). All SWD pupal cases that did not show emergence holes were dissected to determine whether parasitism did occur. This was done by looking for dead larva or pupa of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> inside each SWD pupal case. Parasitoid fecundity was calculated as the total number of SWD pupal cases containing either a dead immature parasitoid or a wasp emergence hole. Parasitoid emergence rate was the number of emerged wasps/fecundity. Sex ratio was the number of female wasps/total wasps. Additionally, we calculated the number of SWD pupae killed by a combination of host-feeding and non-reproductive effects, since these are two important mortality factors but discerning one from the other with accuracy is often not possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref018">18</xref>]. The combination of host-feeding and non-reproductive effects in this study is referred to as &#8220;miscellaneous attack&#8221;. It was calculated as the number of SWD pupal cases showing neither an emergence hole nor a dead immature parasitoid minus natural SWD mortality.</p>
<p>Because young female parasitoids may have specific nutritional needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref048">48</xref>], all the above mentioned parameters were measured considering both entire and early adulthood (4&#8211;9 days old). One- and two-days old wasps were not used in the experiment because those ages were reserved for mating, as previously explained. Three-day olds were excluded because at that age females still carry the egg load developed with resources acquired at the larval stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref044">44</xref>].</p>

<title>Assay #2&#8212;Limited supply</title>
<p>Two-days-old mated females of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> were split in five groups and offered (1) water, (2) honey, (3) water + honey, (4) no water no honey (fasting), or (5) host (N = 94, 47, 95, 39, and 70, respectively) for 30 minutes. Only females that were na&#239;ve to sugar, water, and hosts were used. In the first four groups, honey and water were offered in flat tubes as described in <italic>Assay 1</italic>. In the fifth group, each female wasp was individualized in a clear gelatinous capsule (#00) and offered a single host (&lt;2-days-old SWD pupa). From a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218301.ref043">43</xref>], 30 minutes from the moment when each wasp first touched the host, allowed sufficient time for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> to drill a hole in a SWD&#8217;s pupal case to host-feed and leave the host. Similarly, preliminary observations showed that 30 minutes was long enough for adult <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vindemmiae</italic> to exploit and leave the water and honey sources. After feeding, the wasps were individualized into new tubes with no water, no honey, and no hosts, and were held under controlled conditions as described in <italic>Assay 1</italic>. Mortality was recorded daily.</p>

All estimates and analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.0b for Mac OS X (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Review of the study entitled: &#8220;Factors affecting the biology of Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) on spotted-wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii)&#8221;</p>
<p>General comments</p>
<p>The goal of this manuscript was to evaluate the effects of &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; (sex and age) and &#8220;extrinsic&#8221; (resource offer; e.g. water, honey, water + honey) factors on the survival, fecundity, host-killing capacity, sex-ratio and emergence rate of a parasitoid wasp that lay eggs in fly pupae. In laboratory conditions, the authors have found that wasps fed with water + honey had increased rates of survival, that males and females had different survival rates depending on the offered food resource, that water resource is more important for the survival of young females, among other findings. The authors had performed two sets of experiments: for the first assay, they offered resources ad libitum, while for the second assay, the adult wasps were fed once during a 30-minutes period.</p>
<p>Although I find the study interesting and important due to its practical applications, I have struggled to understand the applied methods and results as I found it to be very confusing. In addition to it, the figures that I had access to have bad resolution and some of them (Figure 3) have illegible axes. I also had problems with some tables.</p>
<p>In Table 1, for instance, it is written: &#8220;Comparison of survival curves by long-rank (Mantel-Cox) test to evaluate the impact of constant and limited supply of water, honey, water + honey, and fasting (no honey, no water) on adult males and females of Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), in the presence and absence of hosts&#8230;&#8221;, but when we look at the table, the results are separated by wasp&#8217;s sex and host presence, with no mention to any supply. Does that mean that the authors evaluated the effects of all supplies (water, honey, water + honey, and fasting) combined on males and females? By reading the corresponding result section, I don&#8217;t think so, since it is written: &#8220;&#8230;we found that the availability of water + honey resulted in significantly higher survival curves than honey alone, water alone, and fasting (no honey, no water), independent of sex and host availability (Males: P&lt;0.0001, N=8-9; Females: P&lt;0.0001, 129 N=10-16; Females + host: P=0.0049, N=9-15;) (Fig 2ab, Table 1). Here they discriminated the treatments, although Table 1 had not separated effects. It seems that the Female + host treatment (P=0.0049) considered the effects of water + honey in comparison to the other treatments (at least it is the same P value in the table). Furthermore, if they are comparing the water + honey treatment with the other three, it should not there be three P values for each sex treatment? (Female: water + honey x honey; water + honey x water; water + honey x fasting; Male: water + honey x honey&#8230;). The treatments got me confused, too. In the methods section, the authors established (for assay 1) eight treatments: (1) water, (2) honey, (3) water + honey, (4) no water, no honey (fasting), (5) water + hosts, (6) honey + hosts, (7) water + honey + hosts, and (8) no water, no honey + hosts. But in Table 1 the &#8220;hosts&#8221; treatments are not considered as supply, but in a treatment called Female + hosts. Although I believe that the authors did that since only females had the &#8220;host&#8221; treatment, it seems the treatments are changing throughout the text.</p>
<p>I also cannot understand the N used in the experiments. Most of the times the N shown are intervals. In Table 1 we have N=8-9; N=10-16 and N=9-15. What does an N of 9-15 mean? The reader must know exactly the N of each experiment. In Table 3, the legend reports an N = 8-16. However, the authors reported a DFd of 40 to 44, which means that the N was of at least 42 (DFd = N &#8211; a, where a = number of factors, which is 2, I believe). How are those values so different? Maybe there was some kind of pseudoreplication?</p>
<p>In Table 2, the host diet is &#8220;not applicable&#8221; to any treatments (male, female and female + hosts). I do not understand why, since the authors used hosts in half of the treatments described in assay 1, and there is even a treatment here that considered hosts. Is that because the authors did not offer only hosts in any treatment (assay 1)? If that is so, why is this treatment observed in assay 2? Also, why did the authors choose to conduct two assays? I saw no justification for that.</p>
<p>The abstract needs some improvements. The use of &#8216;host&#8221; as supply (together with water and honey) is confusing since I did not imagine that adults of P. vindemmiae feed on its hemolymph; I was thinking about the eggs inserted in the hosts. It should be clear that the adults feed on the pupae. This confusion happens during the text because sometimes it is not clear whether the authors are writing about the adult or juvenile wasps. I had to read the introduction and methods to understand the abstract. In addition, do the adults kill the pupae when they start to feed on it? Maybe this can be clarified in the introduction.</p>
<p>To conclude, I consider this manuscript to be promising, but the presentation of methods and results made me struggle to understand it. Although I see no major problems in the introduction and discussion, the manuscript still needs a lot of work and the ideas need to be more clear.</p>
<p>Specific comments</p>
<p>By reading the title, it is not possible to understand that the system involves a parasitoid species unless the reader knows the involved species. I had to read the abstract to understand it. I suggest the authors let this information explicit.</p>
<p>Line 33: Does &#8220;host-killing&#8221; mean the offspring kill? It would be good to define this term. I was confusing it with &#8220;host-feeding&#8221;.</p>
<p>Line 53: It needs a reference.</p>
<p>Lines 100-103: It seems a result part. If not, it needs a reference.</p>
<p>Lines 114-116: This sentence needs to be justified.</p>
<p>Line 159: Is the &#177; SD, SE?</p>
<p>Line 200: No need of the word parametric here. ANOVA is ways a parametric test.</p>
<p>Lines 204-205: The table needs to be formatted.</p>
<p>Lines 225-226: Should they be 0.4589 and 0.1835?</p>
<p>Lines 232-233: Is that the honey and water treatments alone or it includes water + honey treatment?</p>
<p>Line 253: If that is the standard error of the mean, it should be SE instead.</p>
<p>Line 257: Is that &#177; SE?</p>
<p>Line 269: 6-11 days cannot be on average.</p>
<p>Line 293: Why does it have intervals here (0.5-1; 17-19)?</p>
<p>Lines 346-347: The first half of the sentence has an odd construction.</p>
<p>Lines 354-357: I do not understand what do you mean here. Do you mean that there is no trade-off since the wasp does not kill the host?</p>
<p>Line 356: I saw both &#8220;trade-off&#8221; and &#8220;tradeoff&#8221; (line 375) throughout the manuscript. Please standardize.</p>
<p>Lines 383-386: it would be more informative if you explain right away that the water deprivation (not water availability) increased the host-killing.</p>
<p>Lines 388-391: Although the diet has not affected the emergence rates, it affected the number of viable eggs (Lines 327-330). Maybe these two parts can be gathered.</p>
<p>Lines 152, 155, 250, 539, 756: Please fix the term to &#8220;log-rank&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript &#8220;Factors affecting the biology of Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) on spotted-wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii)&#8221; describes a laboratory study that aimed to show factors that affect the biological aspects of P. vindemiae, as well as show the effectiveness of the included biological controller in situations with scarce nutritional resources. The relevance of water as a source and their influence on physiology and fecundity has been shown in a previous report by three authors of this paper &#8220;Water-Deprived Parasitic Wasps (Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae) Kill More Pupae of a Pest (Drosophila suzukii) as a Water-Intake Strategy&#8221;. Also the efficiency as biological controller over D suzukii has been tested by other studies (Bonneau et al., 2019). Therefore in those aspects I have not seen relevant information of the present manuscript. However, aspects related to sex and age related to longevity and parasite capacity throughout their lifespan are interesting aspects and new information produced by the study. In addition the parasitoid&#8217;s controlling capacity even in resource deficit, which is fundamental for the implementation of this parasitoid in integrated pest control systems and provides new opportunities for future research. The title of the paper I think is correct because it indicates that it will focus on the factors affecting the biology that has been adequately approached. And the objectives are well-defined, indicating which parameters they will address, but I missed a hypothesis indicating what they would expect given that they performed treatments with individuals supplying and omitting different resources, besides that there are already similar studies with other parasitoids.</p>
<p>- Line 175-177: &#8220;Fecundity was significantly increased by water deprivation (honey and fasting)&#8230;, while the effect of honey was insignificant&#8221;. I think that you missed to discuss these results (these are even mentioned in line 31-33 of the abstract), so I believe that it is necessary to discuss why water is increased fecundity in young females and honey was not shown significant differences, what could be the reason for that.</p>
<p>- Line 253: Table 2 is after table 3, which is in line 200, you need to place the tables in an ordered numbering.</p>
<p>- Line 467: &#8220;Emerged adults were released into new Bugdorm cages to restart the cycle&#8221;&#8230; Were individuals placed in new cages separately by sex? Or together? Please specify this.</p>
<p>- Line 486: &#8220;We tested 8-14 wasp/treatment/sex&#8221;. Could you describe it better. Were 8 to 14 wasps tested per treatment and per sex? Was that what you meant? That&#8217;s what I understood.</p>
<p>- Line 490-492: &#8220;To control for potential differences in the relative humidity among treatments that were water deprived (1, 3, 5, and 7) and water provided (2, 4, 6, and 8)&#8221;. The deprived water treatments were not 2,4,6,8 and those supplied with water were 1,3,5,7? that was confusing. On line 474 you mention the kinds of treatment and there you state that 1, 3, 5 and 7 were supplied with water and the other ones were deprived of water.</p>
<p>- Line 515 - 520: In my view, I recommend that for a better understanding this paragraph should be at the beginning, in line 472, because if not, it sounds like you&#8217;re coming back on a subject that you&#8217;ve already explained and with no order in the text.</p>
<p>- Supporting information - S1_table: I consider that means, medians and variances of the data are not included, as well as the normality and homocedasticity tests of the analyzed data.</p>

<p>Reviewer #2: All comments have been addressed</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>

<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: The authors have performed a great effort to address all issues and I believe the manuscript is now much more clear. I just want to specify one of my comments since it was not clear enough. In table 3, the header is not centered like the other tables (at least they seem centered to me). Also, in the fourth column (table 3), the values are sometimes spaced and sometimes not. Other than that, I have nothing more to add.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p>
<p>**********</p>

If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
<p>If you choose &#8220;no&#8221;, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
