<abstract>
<p>Metronomic chemotherapy using the 5-FU prodrug uracil-tegafur (UFT) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) was previously shown to only modestly delay primary tumor growth, but nevertheless markedly suppressed the development of micro-metastasis in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model, using the metastatic variant of the MDA-MB-231 cell line, 231/LM2-4. Furthermore, a remarkable prolongation of survival, with no toxicity, was observed in a model of postsurgical advanced metastatic disease. A question that has remained unanswered is the seemingly selective anti-metastatic mechanisms of action responsible for this treatment. We assessed the <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of metronomic UFT, CTX or their combination, on vascular density, collagen deposition and c-Met (cell mediators or modulators of tumor cell invasion or dissemination) via histochemistry/immunohistochemistry of primary tumor sections. We also assessed the effect of continuous exposure to low and non-toxic doses of active drug metabolites 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) or their combination, on 231/LM2-4 cell invasiveness <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, a significant reduction in vascular density and p-Met[Y1003] levels was associated with UFT+CTX treatment. All treatments reduced intratumoral collagen deposition. In the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, a significant reduction of collagen IV invasion by all treatments was observed. The 3D structures formed by 231/LM2-4 on Matrigel showed a predominantly Mass phenotype under treated conditions and Stellate phenotype in untreated cultures. Taken together, the results suggest the low-dose metronomic chemotherapy regimens tested can suppress several mediators of tumor invasiveness highlighting a new perspective for the anti-metastatic efficacy of metronomic chemotherapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An investigational form of therapy known as low-dose metronomic chemotherapy has been studied both preclinically and clinically for almost two decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref001">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref005">5</xref>]. Metronomic chemotherapy refers to the close regular (continuous) administration of less than maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) with each administration of a conventional chemotherapy drug, generally over long periods, in the absence of any prolonged (e.g. 2&#8211;3 week) break periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref001">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref005">5</xref>]. The proposed main anti-tumor mechanisms mediated by metronomic chemotherapy include inhibition of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref006">6</xref>], stimulation of adaptive T and possibly innate NK cell mediated immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref007">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref011">11</xref>] and direct tumor cell killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref012">12</xref>]. The relative impact of these different mechanisms can depend on and vary with the chemotherapy drug used, and likely other variables such as drug dose and schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref010">10</xref>]. A prime example of this is the long-standing observation that low-dose cyclophosphamide (CTX) can induce or augment tumor immunity, especially by targeting immunosuppressive T regulatory (Treg) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Most preclinical and metronomic clinical trial studies utilize oral drugs such as CTX, the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) prodrugs capecitabine or UFT (uracil plus tegafur), methotrexate, topotecan, and vinorelbine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref013">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref020">20</xref>], all of which can be taken on a convenient out-patient basis at home, and are usually associated with reduced serious acute toxic (adverse) events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref004">4</xref>]. Furthermore, these drugs, all being off-patent, mean that the cost of metronomic chemotherapies can be particularly inexpensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref005">5</xref>]</p>
<p>A number of preclinical metronomic chemotherapy studies have shown surprisingly potent anti-tumor effects in some cases, even when treating advanced metastatic disease in mice, as well as earlier stage micrometastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref019">19</xref>]. Such findings have helped contribute to the rationale of undertaking clinical trials assessing metronomic chemotherapy, including some recent randomized phase III clinical trials. Given the presumed lesser toxicity of metronomic chemotherapy and the convenience of oral dosing, most of these phase III trials have evaluated metronomic chemotherapy regimens as long-term maintenance therapies following induction (upfront) conventional MTD chemotherapy regimens. Two noteworthy examples are the Dutch Colorectal Group CAIRO3 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref018">18</xref>] in first line metastatic colorectal cancer patients, which evaluated daily continuous lower dose capecitabine combined with the VEGF antibody, bevacizumab (Avastin&#174;) as maintenance, compared to observation only (i.e., no further treatment in patients who did not progress after induction therapy), which reported a prolongation of progression free survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref018">18</xref>]. A second phase III clinical trial involved young adult rhabdomyosarcoma patients at high risk for recurrence after induction therapy, utilizing metronomic daily low-dose CTX, plus oral vinorelbine as a follow-up maintenance regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref020">20</xref>]. This pediatric oncology trial showed a benefit in both progression-free survival and overall survival compared to the observation/no treatment arm, and will become the new standard-of-care for this indication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref020">20</xref>]. In addition, a long term (1 year) protocol of maintenance low-dose CTX (50mg daily) with methotrexate twice a week was evaluated as an adjuvant therapy in women with early stage breast cancer, after standard induction therapy, in a randomized phase III trial (ISBCG 00&#8211;22); a trend for increased survival was reported with a post hoc analysis indicating a progression free survival and overall survival benefit in the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subgroup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref021">21</xref>]. Many other phase II breast cancer trials suggest possible benefits of metronomic chemotherapy regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref022">22</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref026">26</xref>], including in TNBC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>In general, more trials of metronomic chemotherapy are being evaluated in breast cancer than any other indication (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/" ns0:type="simple">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> and above) utilizing a variety of chemotherapy drugs, especially &#8216;doublets&#8217; such as vinorelbine with CTX, capecitabine with CTX, and capecitabine with vinorelbine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref022">22</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref027">27</xref>]. In this regard, a pooled analysis of six randomized controlled trials showed that metronomic treatment with UFT, over two years, appears to improve the survival of patients with node-negative breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the encouraging, albeit somewhat limited, recent phase III clinical results of metronomic chemotherapy, and the encouraging multiple phase II clinical trial results in breast cancer over the last 5 years, we decided to resume further preclinical metronomic chemotherapy mechanism-related studies in a TNBC model, the nature of which we first reported over a decade ago. Specifically, using the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer variant 231/LM2-4 generated by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref013">13</xref>], we previously evaluated the effects of UFT administered in a daily low-dose oral metronomic schedule, either alone or in combination with metronomic CTX. We examined the effect of these treatments on localized primary orthotopically transplanted tumors, and on the progression of metastases following primary tumor resection. Only treatment with CTX showed delayed tumor growth, while UFT alone was ineffective. However, a marked slowdown in the development of micrometastases was observed in the treated groups. In the experiment involving treatment of advanced metastatic disease, using survival as an end point, UFT therapy alone did not have any significant effect, the CTX monotherapy was, to a small degree, effective in prolonging survival. Nevertheless, the continuous combination therapy of a UFT+CTX doublet for 140 days brought about an almost complete resolution of established (advanced) metastatic disease in the absence of any overt toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition, a number of different <italic>in vivo</italic> models that mimic early rather than advanced metastatic disease, have been developed by other groups. In these models, daily, low-dose UFT was effective at controlling micrometastases, not only in breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref029">29</xref>] but also in lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Important information that remains lacking from a majority of the studies showing the effectiveness of low-dose UFT and CTX combination regimens is the anti-tumor mechanistic basis involved. Previous pre-clinical studies indicated anti-angiogenic activity of metronomic treatment with CTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref032">32</xref>] and UFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref034">34</xref>] when used as individual agents. Several clinical studies have shown a reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plasma levels associated with the treatment of continuously low-dose CTX alone or in combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref036">36</xref>] and by metronomic UFT administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref038">38</xref>]. Interestingly, c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase activation was suggested as a mediator of the development of more aggressive tumor phenotypes upon VEGF signaling inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref039">39</xref>]. Overexpression and activation of c-Met might occur in response to tumor hypoxia elevation as a compensatory mechanism to VEGF-pathway inhibition, or as a result of the systemic host-mediated response to VEGF inhibitory treatment.</p>
<p>Given this background, we decided to employ our previously established orthotopic 231/LM2-4 breast cancer model to examine the effect of metronomic UFT, CTX and the UFT+CTX combination on vascular density, collagen deposition and c-Met in the primary tumor setting, which we assessed by means of histochemistry/immunohistochemistry. The rationale for restricting these studies to primary tumor treatment models is the observation that despite the modest or even lack of effects on primary tumor growth in terms of changes in tumor volume, there was a marked suppressive effect on development of micrometastases, even by metronomic UFT treatment alone, as noted above. We reasoned that this unexpected effect on micrometastases might be relevant to explaining the potent suppressive effect of metronomic UFT+CTX on established late stage metastatic disease. To complement the <italic>in vivo</italic> findings, and to assess evidence for the possible direct anti-invasive effect of the aforementioned treatments, we also evaluated the effect of continuous low-dose of 5-FU, 4-HC and the 5-FU+4-HC combination on the migratory and invasive potential of the 231/LM2-4 metastatic breast cancer cell line <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that metronomic therapy <italic>in vivo</italic> using the CTX and UFT prodrugs alone, but especially in combination, inhibit several and diverse mediators of tumor dissemination <italic>in vivo</italic> and moreover, their corresponding active metabolites, 5-FU and 4-HC, similarly inhibit tumor cell invasiveness <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>UFT, CTX and combination UFT+CTX therapy have only limited effect on the growth of 231/LM2-4 primary orthotopic tumors</title>
<p>231/LM2-4 human breast cancer variant cell line was orthotopically implanted in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Treatment with UFT, CTX and the UFT+CTX doublet combination were administered in a metronomic dose/schedule daily, at the previously determined optimal biological doses, and started at day 14 after cell injection, when tumors reached a size of 160 to 190mm<sup>3</sup>. The effect of the different treatments on primary tumor growth is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g001">Fig 1</xref>. UFT had no discernible antitumor effect when assessed by changes in tumor size up to day 34 post-cell implantation (One-way ANOVA, Dunnett&#8217;s comparison P&gt;0.05). At this point vehicle and UFT groups required termination as they had reached end-point (approximate tumor volume of 1,300 mm<sup>3</sup>). By contrast, CTX and the UFT+CTX combination delayed primary tumor growth such that end-point was not reached until day 47 post-cell implantation. These results are in agreement with our previously published results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref013">13</xref>] and also with the apparent minimal or modest antitumor effect of metronomic UFT monotherapy reported by others, both pre-clinically and in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref040">40</xref>].

<p>An analysis of hematoxilin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections, derived from the central region of both untreated and treated tumors showed large areas of necrosis.

The average percentage of necrosis area was slightly, but not significantly, increased by the treatments.

<title>Alteration of vascular density</title>
<p>In order to evaluate the effect of the different treatments on tumor vasculature a double CD31/VEGFR2 staining was performed and the vascular density was analyzed. The tumor blood vessels were distributed in focal clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222580.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and revealed a higher concentration at the periphery of tumor sections. The degree of expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in tumor vessels has been shown to be variable and dependent on the type of tumor and this fact might have an effect on tumor responses to VEGF pathway inhibiting antiangiogenic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref044">44</xref>]. In our 231/LM2-4 tumor xenograft, VEGFR2 was expressed in all vessels regardless of the treatment. All tumor blood vessels were positive for CD31 and for VEGFR2. The average vessel count from the different tumors groups is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g002">Fig 2B</xref>. Treatment with CTX and with the UFT+CTX combination induced a significant decrease in the density of double positive CD31/VEGFR2 vessels. The decrease in vascular density was observed in both, tumor sections from the central region and from the invasive border. A significant reduction in microvascular density by low dose metronomic CTX treatment in 231/LM2-4 bearing nude mice has been observed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref045">45</xref>]. However, UFT alone did not cause any reduction in the density of CD31/VEGFR-2-positive tumor blood vessels or tumor volume; instead, on the invasive border of tumors a slight, non-significant increase in vessels was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g002">Fig 2B</xref>-grey column). This effect was reversed by the combination with CTX. In fact, the decrease in vascular density in the group treated with the UFT+CTX combination was slightly higher than that obtained with CTX monotherapy.</p>

<title>Alteration of tumoral collagen deposition</title>
<p>Collagen is the main structural protein component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and an increase in collagen deposition and thickness, is often found in regions of tumor cell invasion, indicating that these collagen characteristics might facilitate cancer cell migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref047">47</xref>].

<title>Reduction of phosphorylated and activated form of c-Met, p-Met[Y1003], by the metronomic chemotherapy treatments</title>
<p>The 231/LM2-4 cell line was selected, as indicated, from the well characterized MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line, which apart from the typical expression profile of triple negative tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref049">49</xref>], expresses c-Met, cadherin-11 (similar to N-cadherin) and a mutant form of p-53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>We examined the expression of c-Met and p-Met[Y1003] by immunohistochemistry in control and treated 231/LM2-4 tumor xenografts. The expression and cellular distribution of c-Met was analyzed using an antibody directed at the cytoplasmic domain of the human c-Met protein. We based this choice on several studies demonstrating that, unlike antibodies directed to the extracellular or transmembrane domain, the use of antibodies directed to the intracellular c-Met domain correlated with poor patient outcome and their use permitted the identification of nuclear c-Met in more aggressive forms of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref053">53</xref>]. To analyse phosphorylated c-Met, a phosphospecific antibody targeting Y1003 phospho-epitope (localized to the juxtamembrane portion of the receptor) was used. The intensity of c-Met and p-Met[Y1003] staining was evaluated using the following grading system: weak (grade 1), moderate (grade 2) and strong (grade 3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222580.s009">S2 Table</xref>). The tumor necrotic areas were excluded from scoring.</p>
<p>In untreated 231/LM2-4 tumor xenografts, c-Met staining was relatively homogenous throughout the tumor tissue, and was both cytoplasmic and nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

This intensity of cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was moderate (grade 2) increasing to strong (grade 3) at the periphery. In certain tumor areas, a large amount of reactive stroma was present, which stained strong (grade 3) for cytoplasmic and nuclear p-Met[Y1003]; acini surrounded by an invasive tumor showed both cytoplasmic and strong nuclear staining. This suggests that c-Met signalling in &#8220;normal&#8221; adjacent epithelium and stroma is activated in these aggressive tumors and thus might potentially contribute to tumor progression. Also a significant p-Met[Y1003] nuclear staining was detected in tumor areas of viable cells encircled by necrosis.

Continuous treatment of the cells over six days with the aforementioned drugs concentrations had little effect on cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). The viability assay was performed in a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer culture. Previous studies have demonstrated a lower efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs on several breast tumor cells lines, including MDA-MB-231, cultured in 3D conditions as compared to monolayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref055">55</xref>].</p>

<title>Effect of continuous exposure to 5-FU, 4-HC and 5-FU+4-HC on viability and invasiveness of 231/LM2-4 cells.</title>
<p>(A) Effect of prolonged continuous exposures (six days) to different concentrations of 5-FU (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 10&#956;M), 4-HC (0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 1&#956;M), and to the combination 1&#956;M 5-FU + 0.01&#956;M 4-HC, on <italic>in vitro</italic> viability of 231/LM2-4 cells. The relative absorbance (A<sub>490nm</sub>-A<sub>650nm</sub>) to control is represented; A<sub>490nm</sub> is directly proportional to the number of living cells and A<sub>650nm</sub> eliminates any kind of background. (B) Assessment of the invasive capacity of 231/LM2-4 cells, under untreated and treated conditions, in a transwell chemoinvasion assay using collagen type IV as coating. The protracted treatments with low dose and non-toxic doses of 1&#956;M 5-FU, 0.01&#956;M 4-HC and the 1&#956;M 5-FU + 0.01&#956;M 4-HC combination are detailed in Materials and methods. Cells that invaded and passed through membrane pores were stained with 0.1% crystal violet and counted. The numbers are the mean &#177; standard error of the mean (SEM), of the cell counts of eight random fields (x20 magnification) per sample of a representative experiment. The experiment was repeated three times. A significant reduction in invasive capacity of the cells was observed in all treated groups (***p&lt;0.0001 <italic>vs</italic>. control). Significance was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett&#8217;s post-test.</p>

<title>Three dimensional <italic>in vitro</italic> assay using Matrigel</title>
<p>The 3D lrECM &#8220;on-top&#8221; assay using Matrigel as a barrier seeks to mimic the interstitial matrix <italic>in vivo</italic>, providing an environment where signalling between neighbouring cells and the cell-extracellular matrix is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref056">56</xref>]. Kenny <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref057">57</xref>] demonstrated that in contrast to the similar morphology adopted by cells growing as 2D monolayer, the culture of epithelial breast cancer cell lines using this 3D assay showed different morphologies, that were classified by analysis with phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy into four groups: Round, Mass, Grape-like and Stellate. The breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was characterized as Stellate showing an invasive phenotype with stellate invasive protrusions. A correlation between 3D cell morphologies and cellular gene and protein expression patterns was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>In our 3D lrECM &#8220;on-top&#8221; assay, 231/LM2-4 cells formed multicellular structures.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref057">57</xref>] with modifications. These groups were Mass, Pseudo-Stellate Mass, and Stellate.

<p>As this is the first study to assess 3D structures formed by the 231/LM2-4 cells, we conducted a complete morphologic analysis of these structures. As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222580.t001">Table 1</xref>, most of the multicellular structures in the control untreated cells display a Stellate phenotype. The structural characteristics of this phenotype are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g010">Fig 10C</xref>-left and correspond with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref058">58</xref>], it should be noted the presence of several multicellular chains, with a collective cell migration pattern of invasion together with a protrusive leading front with one or multiple leading cells with invadopodia, in which the rear cells follow the leader cell (coordinated migration). The structural characteristic of Mass and Pseudo-Stellate Mass structures formed by control untreated cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g010">Fig 10A</xref>-left and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g010">Fig 10B</xref>-left respectively. Dissemination of single tumor cells from the structures and collective dissemination were rarely observed.</p>
<p>The Mass and Pseudo-Stellate Mass phenotypes were more abundant following prolonged continuous exposures (6 days) to 5-FU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222580.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), 4-HC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222580.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) and the 5-FU+4-HC combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g010">Fig 10</xref>-right) than the Stellate phenotype as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222580.t001">Table 1</xref>. The structural characteristic of Mass and Pseudo-Stellate Mass structures formed under exposure to 5-FU+4-HC are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g010">Fig 10A</xref>-right and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g010">Fig 10B</xref>-right respectively. Mass structures presenting multicellular streaming with no apparent junction contacts were more abundant than in the untreated cells. In all treated cells, an increase in single and collective cell dissemination of tumor cells from Mass and Pseudo-Stellate Mass structures into the Matrigel was observed compared to control.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a different degree of disruption by granularity of some Masses and Pseudo-Stellate Masses was seen in all treated cells. As a consequence, the 3D cluster configuration was either still evident or disappeared, becoming a collection of dispersed single cells. The frequency of these disrupted structures observed by microscope field (x10 magnification) was 0 for untreated cells, 0.5 for 5-FU, 0.7 for 4-HC and 0.55 for 5-FU+4-HC treated cells.</p>
<p>For the fewer Stellate multicellular structures observed in all treated groups, important differences with the control cells were a reduction in the number of multicellular strands per structure, with high variability in their length, and heterogeneity in the leading edge. With regard to the latter, a protrusive leading front was seen, with one or multiple leading cells with invadopodia. As well as, a large number of leading buds, characterized by the absence of a leader cell with a well-defined position, and by a smooth rim lacking invadopodia. Thus in the 5-FU+4-HC treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g010">Fig 10C</xref>-right), an obvious reduction in the number of strands by structure was observed compared to the control cells. In addition, an uncoordinated arrangement and directionality of the component cells was observed in some multicellular chains, as well as contacts or more commonly fusions between different structures to form a large stellate structure.</p>
<p>A Stellate morphology of 3D structures formed by mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells on Matrigel, including MDA-MB-231, has been associated with invasiveness and metastatic potential by us and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref060">60</xref>], while an article by Mai <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref061">61</xref>] suggests that a &#8220;granularity&#8221; phenotype, such as the one we observed in treated 3D structures is associated with loss of cell-cell contact but not with invasiveness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results provide a possible explanation for a previously reported paradoxical observation, namely, why a particular metronomic chemotherapy regimen, in this case that was used to treat a triple negative breast cancer xenograft&#8211;had only a very modest effect on delaying orthotopic primary tumor growth, but nevertheless caused major inhibition of established metastatic disease in a postsurgical model. The explanation is that the metronomic chemotherapy treatment may mediate anti-invasive effects at the tumor periphery/invasive borders of tumors, and this could include metastases, in the absence of acute massive or even modest cytotoxic effects on the tumor mass. As such, this could be the basis for the impact of metronomic chemotherapy in suppressing the extent of micrometastases detected in mice with primary MDA-MB-231/LM2-4 tumors treated with metronomic UFT alone, metronomic CTX alone, and especially when the two drugs are combined and administered concurrently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref013">13</xref>]. While this effect can provide a basis for explaining how the therapy can have an adjuvant therapy effect on early stage micrometastatic disease, it is not as clear whether the apparent anti-invasive effects of the UFT+CTX metronomic chemotherapy protocol and either UFT alone or CTX alone contributed to the observed striking impact of greatly prolonging the survival of mice when treatment was only initiated several weeks after primary tumor resection, i.e., at a time when metastases were already established. It is possible that the anti-invasive effects at the tumor periphery may serve to limit further expansion of tumor growth, and metastatic disease progression, while at the time the prolonged daily therapy could cause a gradual and cumulative tumor cell loss by mechanisms such as direct tumor cell kill via necrosis, as discussed below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref045">45</xref>], inhibition of angiogenesis, or activating innate immune cell effector activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref007">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The current <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment was conducted under the exact same conditions as the aforementioned study. These studies differ only with respect to endpoint, which in our previous experiment was the maximum tumor volume ethically permitted, 1,700mm<sup>3</sup>, while in the current experiment was around 1,300mm<sup>3</sup> in all groups, reasoning that the control tumors at this size could reflect an earlier step in the metastatic cascade and that standardization by size could minimize the influence of microenvironmental factors such as hypoxia or insufficient blood flow that are size dependent.</p>
<p>To implicate the anti-invasive effects of the metronomic UFT plus CTX doublet combination, or of the respective monotherapies, we undertook six different assays, four <italic>in vivo</italic> and two <italic>in vitro</italic>: evaluating necrosis in the tumor core vs. the tumor periphery, evaluating vascular density, again in the tumor core vs. tumor periphery, assessing p-Met[Y1003], assessing impact on the extent of tumor collagen deposition in activity; the two <italic>in vitro</italic> assays used as surrogates for <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor cell invasion were a transwell migration assay and a 3D matrigel assay.</p>
<p>In the evaluation of necrosis in the tumor core vs. the tumor periphery, our results suggest that in the tumor periphery, both UFT and CTX, when used as single agents, caused necrosis, and a significant increase in necrosis was observed in the UFT+CTX treated tumors with respect to control group. The level of necrosis in the invasive border sections of the tumors might be indicative of a meaningful contribution mediated by each experimental condition to cell death through necrosis. These results additionally indicate that the observed lack of effect of the UFT treatment in tumor volume, as measured externally using a calliper, may be misleading. Therefore, the volume of a viable tumor should be more reliably calculated from the total tumor volume minus the volume of the necrotic tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref063">63</xref>]. In addition, local invasion changes may be masked when only assessing tumor volumes.</p>
<p>In parallel, we evaluated the effect of the different treatments on tumor vasculature and we determined an anti-angiogenic effect of low-dose metronomic CTX and the UFT+CTX combination. This reduction in vascular tumor density is associated with a reduction in tumor volume in both groups of treatment.</p>
<p>The expression and cellular distribution of c-Met and its activated form p-Met[Y1003] was analyzed in untreated and treated 231/LM2-4 tumor xenografts. A specific correlation between c-Met expression and basal breast cancer subtypes was previously established using tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref064">64</xref>]. Charaffe-Jauffret <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref050">50</xref>] in a gene expression profiling of breast cancer cell lines, belonging to luminal and basal cell subtypes, showed that the discriminator genes between both subtypes are associated with cell adhesion, cell motility and invasion, which might be related to the poorer basal tumor prognosis. These discriminator genes included met and Met protein signalling partners. c-Met protein is involved in cancer progression and metastasis. A significant correlation between c-Met overexpression, aberrant c-Met activation and poor outcome has been found in different solid tumors, including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref065">65</xref>]. c-Met phosphorylation is an indicator of signalling activation and thus reflects elevated tumor activity compared to unphosphorylated receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref066">66</xref>]. Selection of Y1003, was based on its better immunodetection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref068">68</xref>] and because high levels of p-Met[Y1003] were associated with malignancy and therapy resistance. For instance, p-Met[Y1003] overexpression in non-small-cell lung cancer patients, correlated with gefitinib resistance and shorter time to progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref069">69</xref>]. In addition, p-Met[Y1003] was detected in human melanomas but not in nevi or normal epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref067">67</xref>]. Phospho-Y1003 is responsible for the recruitment of Cbl ubiquitin ligase to c-Met, which facilitates c-Met endocytic trafficking into the lysosomal compartment. c-Met endocytic trafficking is not only necessary for signal attenuation, but it is required for optimal signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref071">71</xref>]. It is important to note that the high expression of c-Met and its activated status in the xenograft model employed here permitted its immune-detection and analysis; however, it is not clear which mechanism accounts for c-Met activation in the tumors. In treated 231/LM2-4 tumor xenografts, also strong c-Met levels, localizing to the nucleus and cytoplasm, were observed. However p-Met[Y1003] showed only focally immunopositivity in a predominantly nuclear pattern. A significant reduction in p-Met[Y1003] levels were found in the UFT+CTX group compared to control.</p>
<p>In relation with the two <italic>in vitro</italic> assays used as surrogates for <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor cell invasion the transwell migration assay, using collagen type IV as coating, showed a significant inhibition of invasion potential of 231/LM2-4 cells in the presence of the drugs <italic>versus</italic> control conditions. and a 3D matrigel assay. However, the obvious reduction of invasion caused by all treatments <italic>in vitro</italic> was not paralleled by our qualitative assessment of local invasion by vimentin staining in treated <italic>versus</italic> control xenografts. This might reflect the complex and dynamic process of metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>, in which different players in space and time are involved. By other hand, the 3D matrigel assay showing a detailed morphologic analysis of the 3D structures formed by the 231/LM2-4 cells on Matrigel suggest that metronomic UFT, CTX and the double UFT+CTX treatment may inhibit local invasion of 231/LM2-4 cells, possibly as a result of alterations in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions.</p>
<p>The results of all aforementioned assays, when considered together, create a reasonable argument for the anti-invasive properties of metronomic chemotherapy, at least for the regimen tested. A case in point: the elevated levels of necrosis (and vascular density reductions) at the tumor periphery caused by metronomic UFT or metronomic CTX and especially the two together on MDA-MB-231/LM2-4 primary orthotopic tumors, and a similar pattern for p-Met[Y1003] inhibition. The necrosis findings at the tumor periphery may be pertinent to the above mentioned question regarding how the metronomic UFT+CTX treatment protocol administered continuously over many months could conceivably gradually diminish the growth and size of established metastases and thus greatly prolong survival.</p>
<p>In summary, our results provide a possible new perspective on how metronomic chemotherapy may mediate inhibition of tumor growth and metastatic disease progression. They also highlight the limitations of relying only on tumor growth/size changes as an indication of anti-tumor activity in preclinical models involving treatment of established primary tumors&#8211;lack of activity, or detection of modest activity, does not necessarily preclude more potent activity on micro or macroscopic metastases.</p>
<p>While our <italic>in vivo</italic> results were initially based on a single experiment with a small number of animals per group as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222580.g003">Fig 3</xref>, we have undertaken additional efforts to support our findings. We undertook these efforts to examine whether the original effect on metastatic disease noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref013">13</xref>] could be extended into a more clinically relevant model of neoadjuvant therapy. In that regard, the evidence for an anti-metastatic potential associated with this approach is now supported by subsequent examination of its effect in this setting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222580.s010">S1 Appendix</xref>). Using this approach a significant effect was noted with respect to bone metastasis. While the levels of lung metastases were lower in the treatment groups CTX and UFT+CTX, these did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>In summary, the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies indicate that the doublet treatment with metronomic UFT+CTX is associated with a significant increase in tumor necrosis at the invasive border areas and a significant reduction in vascular density that are in turn associated with tumor growth inhibition. In addition, all treatments reduced the amount of intratumoral collagen deposition, being more noticeable in the UFT+CTX treated tumors. Finally, UFT+CTX caused a significant reduction in p-Met[Y1003] levels compared to control. The impact of these effects on the invasive capacity of tumor cells cannot be directly determined from our data, but all of these features, especially taken together, could conceivably contribute to the anti-metastatic effects of the doublet UFT+CTX metronomic therapy treatment reported in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref013">13</xref>].</p>

<p>Tegafur, uracil and the vehicle HPMC were supplied by Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. CTX (Baxter Oncology GmbH) was purchased from the institutional Pharmacy, and was reconstituted as per manufacturer&#180;s instructions to a stock concentration of 20mg/ml. UFT, a 5-FU oral prodrug, was prepared fresh daily, immediately prior to use, by adding an aqueous solution of uracil containing 0.1% of HPMC to tegafur in a molar ratio of 4:1, and was administered at 15mg/Kg/d by gavage during the length of the experiment. The CTX treatment was initiated with a bolus intraperitoneal injection of 100mg/Kg body weight (approximately one third of the maximum tolerated dose) on the first day of treatment, and then switched to oral administration, via drinking water, to provide an estimated dose of 20mg/Kg/d. This treatment schedule was in line, with the &#8220;fast&#8221; and &#8220;slow&#8221; metronomic regimen, consisting of daily oral low dose therapy, interspersed every 6 weeks, with a bolus intraperitoneal injection of the drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref013">13</xref>]. The vehicle 0.1% HPMC, as a control, was administered every day by gavage.</p>
<p>A protracted continuous low-dose exposure to the chemotherapeutic drugs, 5-FU, 4-HC and the 5-FU+4-HC combination treatment, was used in the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. The drug concentrations used in each assay are indicated in the corresponding figure legends. 5-FU (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted in culture medium immediately before use. The toxic metabolite/alkylating agent 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) undergoes spontaneous reduction in solution to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, which is the first active metabolite formed in the metabolism of CTX. 4-HC was a gift of Dr S.M. Ludeman (Duke University, Durham, NC). It was stored as a powder at -20&#176;C and prior to use was dissolved at 4&#176;C in distilled water and filtered in sterile conditions.</p>

<p>2x10<sup>6</sup> 231/LM2-4 cells in a 50&#956;l volume were orthotopically implanted into the right inguinal mammary fat pad of CB17 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref013">13</xref>]. Surgical procedures were undertaken using inhaled isoflurane, supplemented with 100% O<sub>2</sub>, as anesthesia technique and Buprenorphine injectable (temgesic<sup>&#174;</sup>) was used as analgesic. Following surgery, the mice were placed under an infrared lamp to prevent hypothermia and were injected subcutaneously with Buprenorphine injectable for pain control. Weekly caliper measurement were performed to determine tumor growth and tumor volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) was assessed using the formula a<sup>2</sup> x b/2, where a and b represent the smallest and largest tumor diameter, respectively. All mice were randomized just before initiation of treatment. Treatment was initiated when the primary intra-mammary fat pad tumor attained a size of 160-190mm<sup>3</sup>. The mice were sacrificed when the tumors reached an average size of approximately 1,300mm<sup>3</sup>. Animal euthanasia was conducted by means of cervical dislocation, immediately after the animals were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation.</p>

<title>Histochemistry and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>The resected mouse tumors were dissected into two parts: the central region and the invasive border of the tumors. Both pieces of each tumor were immediately fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours, and stored in 70% ethanol prior to processing and embedding in paraffin. Sections of 5&#956;m were deparaffinized and several histochemical staining were carried out. The necrotic areas of the tumors were assessed by H&amp;E stain. The collagen content of the tumors was analyzed by a modified Masson&#180;s trichrome staining in accordance with the protocol of MacLean <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref072">72</xref>]. For immunohistochemistry, procedures were as follow: mouse mAb anti vimentin (clone V9), Dako Cytomation (&#8800;M0725) [microwave 10min., citrate buffer, pH 6; 1:50 overnight 4&#176;C]. Rabbit anti Ki67, Vector laboratories VP-K451 [microwave 10min., citrate buffer, pH 6; 1:1000 overnight 4&#176;C. Double immunostaining with goat polyclonal anti CD31/PECAM-1 (M-20), Santa Cruz (#SC-1506) and Rabbit mAb anti VEGFR2 (55B11), Cell Signaling (#2479) [water-bath 96&#176;C 20min., Tris-EDTA, pH 9; 1:100 overnight 4&#176;C and 1:100, 1hour room temperature, respectively]. Mouse mAb anti c-Met (clone 3D4), Invitrogen (&#8800;18&#8211;7366) [microwave 15min., citrate buffer, pH 6; 1:50 overnight 4&#176;C]. Rabbit anti c-Met[pY1003], Invitrogen (&#8800;44-882G) [microwave 15min., citrate buffer, pH 6; 1:500 overnight 4&#176;C]. In the immunoenzymatic staining, DAB was used as peroxidase substrate (Histostain<sup>&#174;</sup> Plus Broad Spectrum (DAB), 85&#8211;9643). In the immunofluorescence staining donkey anti-goat Fluor 488 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30min. and goat anti-rabbit Cy3 (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30min. were used. The effect of different treatments on vascular density was determined by double CD31/VEGFR2 immunofluorescence labeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref044">44</xref>]. Positive blood vessels showed staining for the pan-endothelial cell marker CD31 and for VEGFR2. Seven fields per tumor, from the central region and the invasive border, were counted in areas of highest vascular density (&#8220;hot spots&#8221;) using a Leica DMLB microscope (Q imaging QICAM fast 1394 digital camera) at x20 magnification. The average vessel count/field was determined. Immunohistochemistry was also performed to study the expression of the invasion marker c-Met and p-Met[Y1003]; the immunohistochemistry analysis were evaluated semiquantitatively by assigning an H-score (or &#8220;histo&#8221; score) to tumor samples of 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref074">74</xref>]. The H-score is based on a predominant staining intensity and the relative area of cells of any given intensity of staining in a proportion to the remaining sample, so the percentage of cells at each staining intensity level is calculated for each sample, and finally, an H-score is assigned using the following formula: [1 &#215; (% cells 1+) + 2 &#215; (% cells 2+) + 3 &#215; (% cells 3+)]. The final score, ranged from 0 to 300. Based on the H-scores we performed statistical analysis using Student&#8217;s t-test assuming unequal variance. The staining results were interpreted by two expert independent pathologists (DH and GW) blinded to the different treatment groups.</p>

<p>An <italic>in vitro</italic> viability assay was performed on a single-cell suspension of 231/LM2-4 cells plated on 96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells (1x10<sup>3</sup> cells/well in 200&#956;l of medium) were untreated and treated for 6 days with several concentrations of 5-FU (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 10&#956;M), 4-HC (0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 1&#956;M) and the 1&#956;M 5-FU+0.01&#956;M 4-HC combination. The cells were incubated at 37&#176;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and every 24 hours the medium was replaced with a fresh solution to maintain a constant concentration of the drugs during the whole length of the experiment, as designed by Bocci <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref075">75</xref>]. At the end of the experiment, cells were incubated, with MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium] tetrazolium salt (Promega PR-G1112) and the electron coupling reagent phenazinemethosulfate, following manufacturer instructions. MTS is converted by dehydrogenase enzymes of metabolically active cells into formazan. The absorbance of the formazan at 490nm is directly proportional to the number of living cells. Correcting absorbance at 490nm with the reference wavelength at 650nm eliminates any kind of background.</p>

<title>Drug response in a transwell chemoinvasion assay using type IV collagen</title>
<p>The type IV collagen acquired from BD Biosciences (Catalog number 354233) was diluted to 0.2mg/ml in RPMI without FBS. The upper surfaces of the transwell cell culture inserts containing membrane (8.0&#956;m pore size) were placed on a companion Multiwell<sup>TM</sup> 24 well plate (Becton Dickinson, Cat.3504), and were coated by adding 50&#956;l of diluted collagen and left overnight at 37&#176;C. The 231/LM2-4 cells were plated on 3cm tissue-culture plates and allowed to attach overnight. Next day, the medium was changed and cells were untreated or treated with 1&#956;M 5-FU, 0.01&#956;M 4-HC and the 1&#956;M 5-FU+0.01&#956;M 4-HC combination, the medium being replaced every 24 hours with fresh solution. After four days, the cells were starved in RPMI 1640+0.1% BSA+0.2% FBS medium, with or without drugs, and incubated for one day longer at 37&#176;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. On the sixth day the subconfluent cells were detached with trypsin, resuspended in RPMI 1640+5% FBS and washed twice, once with RPMI 1640 without FBS and once with RPMI 1640+0.1% BSA+0.2% FBS medium, with or without drugs. Finally, the cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640+0.1% BSA+0.2% FBS medium, with or without drugs, and a concentration of 5x10<sup>5</sup> cell/ml and 0.2ml of the cellular suspensions was placed onto the upper surface of the inserts; as a chemoattractant, 0.6ml of RPMI 1640+0.1% BSA+5% FBS medium was added to the well containing the insert. The plates were left at 37&#176;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 24&#8211;30 hours was the time allowed for invasion to occur. The culture medium was then removed and the inserts containing invading tumor cells were properly washed with PBS on the upper and lower surfaces, fixed with 100% methanol for 20min. and stained for 20min. with a solution of 0.1% crystal violet prepared in 20% methanol, and distained with distilled water. A cotton swab was used to remove cells and collagen present on the upper surface of the inserts. The dry and clean membranes were cut, placed on a microscope slide, with the surface containing the invading cells face up, and mounted. The number of tumor cells was quantified by counting eight random fields per sample on a grid, under light microscopy (bright field) at x20 magnification.</p>

<p>Pre-cooled 3cm tissue culture plates were covered with 500&#956;l of 100% Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> matrix Basement Membrane (BD Biosciences, Cat.354234) and then placed at 37&#176;C to allow the Matrigel to solidify [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref076">76</xref>]. Subconfluent monolayers of low passage 231/LM2-4 cells, kept under standard culture conditions, were trypsinized with a small amount of Trypsin-EDTA solution 0,05%, resuspended in RPMI+5% FBS, passed three times through a 10ml syringe 18G needle, washed to remove trypsin, and finally counted. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in the Mammary Epithelium Growth Media (MEGM) containing 10ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), 5&#956;g/ml insulin, 0.5&#956;g/ml hydrocortisone, and supplemented with Bovine Pituitary Extract (BPE), to which 2% Matrigel was added. After cell resuspension, 400&#956;l (30,000 cells) were plated as a single cell suspension on the plates covered with 100% Matrigel<sup>TM</sup> matrix, to which 400&#956;l of MEGM+BPE media were added 30min. before plating. Following careful swirling, the cells were allowed to settle for 5min. and then swirled again, to ensure a homogenous distribution on the plates. Subsequently, 200&#956;l of cold MEGM supplemented mammary medium containing 10% of Matrigel was added to form an overlay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222580.ref056">56</xref>].</p>

<p>Impact of metronomic UFT, cyclophosphamide, or when combined on mediators of breast cancer dissemination in vivo and 3D invasiveness in vitro</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Kerbel,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process by the two Reviewers, both experts in the metronomic field.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Aug 16 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Francesco Bertolini, MD, PhD</p>
<p>Academic Editor</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Journal Requirements:</p>
<p>1. When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>2. To comply with PLOS ONE submissions requirements, in your Methods section, please provide additional information regarding the experiments involving animals and ensure you have included details on (1) methods of sacrifice at the end of the study, (2) methods of anesthesia and/or analgesia, and (3) efforts to alleviate suffering.</p>
<p>3. We note that you have included the phrase &#8220;data not shown&#8221; in your manuscript. Unfortunately, this does not meet our data sharing requirements. PLOS does not permit references to inaccessible data. We require that authors provide all relevant data within the paper, Supporting Information files, or in an acceptable, public repository. Please add a citation to support this phrase or upload the data that corresponds with these findings to a stable repository (such as Figshare or Dryad) and provide and URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers that may be used to access these data. Or, if the data are not a core part of the research being presented in your study, we ask that you remove the phrase that refers to these data.</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: In this paper, Munoz et al provide a possible explanation for a previous work by the same group reporting paradoxical effect of metronomic chemotherapy on primary tumor growth and metastatic disease in a TNBC model. The authors evaluate the effect of low-dose CTX and UFT, and their combination, on vascular density, collagen deposition and c-Met in the primary tumor setting via histochemistry/immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the authors evaluated the in vitro effect of continuous low-dose of active drug metabolites using a transwell migration assay and a 3D matrigel assay.</p>
<p>In order to better appreciate the manuscript, some minor revisions are needed:</p>
<p>1. The title is unclear, please rephrase it.</p>
<p>2. The introduction, even if it is clear and well written, is too long. It must be shortened.</p>
<p>3. In the results sections, Munoz and colleagues also include a discussion about the data. The authors should comment the data specifically in the discussion part. Furthermore, the titles of the paragraphs in the results section must be explicative of the data presented. Do not use general terms as &#8220;effects&#8221; and &#8220;assessment&#8221;, please focus more on the take-on message.</p>
<p>4. In general, I suggest to the authors to present the data reported in the tables with graphs. The raw data could be uploaded as supplementary materials. Also please, provide statistical analysis and a legend for the data in table 1.</p>
<p>5. The main scope of this manuscript is to shed light on the mechanism beyond the observation that UFT, either alone or in combination with CTX, had a modest effect on primary tumor growth, but is able to inhibit metastatic spread. My main concern regards the fact that the authors based most of the evidence from a previous paper (Munoz R et al, 2006). Have the authors performed new experiments to evaluate lung metastasis at mice sacrifice or after tumor resection? If not, they should provide them to corroborate the previous evidences.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Munoz et at reexamine a metronomic chemo drug schedule in a triple negative orthotopedic breast center model that they first described in 2006 (Ref #13), to determine how/why uracil-tegafur-cyclophosphamide (UFT + CTX) inhibits micro-metastasis development but has little inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth. They now find that, although the combination drug treatment has little effect on primary tumor volume (Fig. 1), it significantly increases necrosis and decreases vascularity in invasive border sections of the tumor (Fig. 2). Further, it decreases phosphorylation of the growth factor receptor c-Met, which contributes to tumor growth and metastasis (Fig. 5). Most interesting is the finding, using cell culture models and a trans-well invasion assay, that drug treatment inhibits tumor cell migratory and inhibitory potential but not tumor cell viability. Together, these finding provide a substantial advance in explaining the apparent discrepancy raised by findings in the 2006 study.</p>
<p>Specific concerns include the following:</p>
<p>1. Why did the authors not confirm their 2006 finding of inhibition of micrometastases by the UFT + CTX combination? Tumor cell models can drift/evolve over time (13 years, in this case), and there is some concern that the in vivo findings with primary tumors, reported here, might not be directly applicable to the earlier findings of inhibition of metastasis in what may only nominally be the same tumor model. Further, if the prior metastasis study was performed in a post-surgical model, then the current findings about impact of UFT + CTX on metastatic potential in a non-surgical model may not be directly relevant.</p>
<p>2. In several places, conclusions stated in the text need to be based on a more rigorous implementation of statistical analysis. For example:</p>
<p>- Line 177 - Fig. 1 conclusion of delayed tumor growth needs statistical support. (Also, mark day of first drug treatment along the x-axis)</p>
<p>- Line 281 &#8211; Any conclusion of reduced invasion into adjacent soft tissue requires statistical analysis of Table 1 results.</p>
<p>- Line 300 &#8211; Similarly, the conclusion stated in the text of reduced collagen deposition in all treatment groups requires statistical analysis of Table 2 data. Text on line 302 indicates that is not significant.</p>
<p>- - Line 387 &#8211; Staining scores should be listed for each individual tumor in a supplemental Table, similar to the format of Table 2.</p>
<p>3. The entire work is apparently based on a single in vivo experiment (Fig. 1) with only 4-5 tumors per group. This limitation should be explicitly noted, e.g., in Discussion.</p>
<p>4. What is the impact of drug treatment on MMP expression &#8211; in vitro or in vivo (line 464)?</p>
<p>5. Is the in vitro HC concentration really 10nM? Are there any prior studies showing a biological effect of HC at such a low concentration? That concentration is 100-500-fold lower that typically reported anti-tumor activities for HC.</p>
<p>6. Minor Points</p>
<p>- Shorten Introduction by editing.</p>
<p>- Line 61 &#8211; Correct text to indicate clinical trial metronomic (?) studies</p>
<p>- Line 381 &#8211; Arrow not visible on Figure</p>
<p>- Table 3 &#8211; Specify drug concentration. Same for Figure S6, etc. (see line 631).</p>
<p>- Line 617 ff. Specify sources for HC.</p>
