<abstract>
<p>The Warburg Effect has emerged as a potential drug target because, in some cancer cell lines, it is sufficient to subvert it in order to kill cancer cells. It has also been shown that the Warburg Effect occurs in innate immune cells upon infection. Innate immune cells play critical roles in the tumour microenvironment but the Warburg Effect is not fully understood in monocytes. Furthermore, it is important to understand the impact of infections on key players in the tumour microenvironment because inflammatory conditions often precede carcinogenesis and mutated oncogenes induce inflammation. We investigated the metabolic programme in the acute monocytic leukaemia cell line, THP-1 in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide, mimicking bacterial infections. We found that stimulation of THP-1 cells by LPS induces a subset of pro-inflammatory chemokines and enhances the Warburg Effect. Surprisingly, perturbation of the Warburg Effect in these cells does not lead to cell death in contrast to what was observed in non-myeloid cancer cell lines in a previous study. These findings indicate that the Warburg Effect and inflammation are activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and may have a profound influence on the microenvironment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer cells uncouple glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), a phenomenon known as the Warburg Effect after the German Scientist Otto Warburg who first described it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref001">1</xref>]. This metabolic reprogramming is one of the ten hallmarks of cancer and has been found to occur in activated immune cells as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref002">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref004">4</xref>]. Previously, we have shown that the reversal of the Warburg Effect in some cancer cell lines by the introduction of exogenous pyruvate is sufficient to kill them. In contrast, this strategy promotes survival in a normal cell line even when exogenous pyruvate is combined with a genotoxic agent suggesting that exogenous pyruvate can be used as an adjunctive to protect normal cells during chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Evidence shows that temporal metabolic shifts occur in immune cells. For example, it is known that myeloid cells, which have multiple functions such as killing, migration and toxin production, utilize Warburg metabolism for ATP production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref007">7</xref>]. In contrast, lymphocytes utilize mainly OXPHOS to produce ATP via glutaminolysis, &#946;-oxidation of fatty acids as well as via glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref008">8</xref>]. Metabolic shifts have also been shown to be associated with the differentiation of some immune cells. For example, T<sub>H</sub>1 cells were shown to differentiate to T<sub>reg</sub> cells upon sabotage of the glycolytic phenotype by treatment with the glucose analogue, 2-deoxyglucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Myeloid cells are often activated by exposure to environmental stimuli, resulting in metabolic shifts. For example, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces metabolic reprogramming in macrophages and dendritic cells via Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) by at least four pathways. These include generating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and subsequent suppression of OXPHOS, activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), increase in glucose uptake and glycolysis, upregulating key glycolysis enzymes and inhibiting the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref011">11</xref>]. Although, the metabolic reprogramming that occurs in macrophages and in dendritic cells has been studied extensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref010">10</xref>], little is known about metabolic shifts in monocytes that are exposed to infections especially the impact of bacterial infection on their metabolic programme. Indeed, the impact of infection on cancer cells is poorly understood, even though malignancies such as colorectal cancer are constantly exposed to pathogens. In these environments, innate immune cells associated with epithelial linings play critical roles as the first line of defence. It is thus necessary to investigate the interactions between pathogens and cancerous cells.</p>
<p>THP-1 is a human monocyte leukaemia cell line, which differentiates into macrophage-like cells when treated with phorbol esters. When differentiated, THP-1 cells behave like native monocyte-derived macrophages. They are activated by LPS via TLR-4 and activation of NF&#8211;&#954;B, the key transcription factor that activates expression of effector genes. Optimal response to LPS occurs when the CD14 cell surface protein is also present and is characterized by the production of the pro-inflammatory interleukin-8 (IL-8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref012">12</xref>]. In THP-1 cells, LPS has been shown to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1&#946; (IL-1&#946;), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-&#945;) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) via the TLR4- NF&#954;B signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref013">13</xref>]. In primary monocytes in has been shown that LPS induces a metabolic shift similar to the Warburg Effect in the presence of glucose but rely on mitochondrial respiration in the absence of glucose or abrogation of the Warburg Effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref014">14</xref>]. Terminally differentiated monocytes such as dendritic cells and macrophages are known to exhibit the Warburg effect in response to pathogen invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref010">10</xref>]. About 20% of all cancers are associated with infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref015">15</xref>]. The microbial oncogenic transformation has been shown to be elicited by chronic inflammation as a result of prolonged infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref017">17</xref>]. Nonetheless, the mechanisms that drive infection-associated carcinogenesis are not fully understood and the precise molecular events occurring in the tumour microenvironment are still not fully understood. Therefore, the THP-1 cell line provides an attractive model by which to study metabolic reprogramming in human monocytes especially in circumstances where oncogenic transformation and infection occur simultaneously. A cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced in the tumour microenvironment has been shown to influence carcinogenesis by enhancing proliferation, invasion, chemoresistance and resistance to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref018">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref020">20</xref>]. Thus, it appears that metabolic reprogramming in macrophages and dendritic cells is associated with immune activation and not with cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref021">21</xref>]. Response to similar stress is not clear in monocytes.</p>
<p>In differentiated THP-1 cells, metabolic shifts may be driven by hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;). It has been demonstrated that when activated by phorbol myristate HIF-1&#945; and HIF-1&#946; are upregulated in THP-1 cells as well as in peripheral blood monocytes. This is blocked by inhibitors of P13K, tyrosine kinases, MEK, mTOR, and protein kinase C (PKC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref022">22</xref>]. In contrast, LPS-induced HIF-1 expression is dependent on TLR4 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as it is abrogated by the anti-oxidants <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine and thioredoxin. However, LPS-induced HIF-I&#945; expression in differentiated THP-1 cells was found to be independent of NF&#954;B as it was not inhibited by reservatol and BAY11-7802 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref023">23</xref>]. The key observation by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref023">23</xref>] was that LPS induces activation of HIF-1&#945; in differentiated THP-1 cells but not in undifferentiated cells suggesting that monocytes and macrophages respond differently to LPS activation. In this study, we investigate the impact of infection on the metabolic programme of THP-1 cells, which represent transformed undifferentiated myeloid cells. Using the THP-1 cell line as a model, we also investigate the impact of bacterial infection on cancer cells that should already have a glycolytic phenotype.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that LPS perturbs the cell cycle and enhances the Warburg Effect in the THP-1 cells. Moreover, the Warburg Effect does not appear to be associated with cell proliferation as observed in most cancer cells.</p>

<title>Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction</title>
<p>Following treatment with 5, 10, and 20 ng/ml of LPS for 24 hours, RNA was isolated using the Trizol method as described in manufacturer&#8217;s brochure and RNA concentration was determined using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermofischer Scientific, CA, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 1 &#956;g of total RNA, using the Revert Aid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermofischer Scientific, K1622) and oligo (dT) primers. The reaction was run in a PCR thermal cycler at 42&#176;C for 1 hour.</p>
<p>TLR4 was amplified by PCR in a 25 &#956;L reaction volume containing 200 nM forward and reverse primers, 1.5 &#956;l of cDNA, 12.5 &#956;L of 2X PCR mastermix (New England Biolabs, M0270) and 10 &#956;l of nuclease-free water. Thermal parameters were set as follows: Initial denaturation at 94&#176;C for 30 seconds, followed by a 30-times cycle of 94&#176;C (30 seconds), 60&#176;C (60 seconds), and 68&#176;C (30 seconds) followed by one cycle at 68&#176;C for 5 minutes.

<title>Cytokine expression analysis using ELISA array</title>
<p>The Human, bacterial Toll-like receptor Multi analyte ELISA array kit ((MEH-008A), Hilden, Germany) was used to assess a cytokine profile in response to LPS stimulation as a screening exercise. The wash buffer, bovine serum albumin (BSA), sample dilution buffer, avidin-HRP conjugate and antigen standard cocktail were prepared according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.</p>
<p>The 12 wells in each row of the 96-well ELISA plate (Multi-analyte ELISA array kit, MEH-008A) are pre-coated with monoclonal antibodies to TNF-&#945;, IL1&#946;, IL6, IL12, IL17A, IL8, MCP-1, RANTES, MIP-1&#945;, MIP-1&#946;, MDC and eotaxin. Into sample wells, 50 &#956;l each of assay buffer THP-1 extracts were added. Using a multi-channel pipette, 50 &#956;l of sample dilution buffer was added to all the negative control wells. To prepare the positive control,50 &#956;l of the final antigen standard cocktail was added. The reactions were then processed as described in the manufacturer&#8217;s manual.</p>
<p>Absorbance was read using a microplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan<sup>&#8482;</sup> GO, Thermofischer Scientific, MA, USA) at 450 nm and 570 nm. The readings at 570 nm were subtracted from those at 450 nm for wavelength correction.

<title>Activation of TLR-4 influences the metabolic programme in THP-1 cells</title>
<p>Having shown that LPS activation enhanced Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222614.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), we investigated whether LPS perturbed their metabolic programme by measuring glycolytic activity, oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222614.g001">Fig 1B&#8211;1E</xref>). TLR4 transcription was maximal at about 5 ng/ml and declined at the higher concentration of 20 ng/ml. Lactate measurements indicate that THP-1 cells already have a glycolytic phenotype which is enhanced in 48 hours after stimulation by LPS in a concentration-dependent manner and is impeded by polymyxin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222614.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In the first 24 hours, LPS does not perturb this glycolytic phenotype. When used alone, dichloroacetate (DCA), which sustains endogenous pyruvate into the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle and methyl pyruvate, which represents exogenous pyruvate, reverse the glycolytic phenotype as shown by the reduced lactate and increased oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222614.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the effects of DCA appear to be dependent on TLR4 activation because polymyxin B inhibits restores the glycolytic phenotype of DCA and LPS-treated cells. In contrast, exogenous pyruvate reverses the glycolytic phenotype by a different mechanism, as polymyxin B does not alter lactate production. However, when LPS and exogenous pyruvate appear to reverse the Warburg Effect as they reduce the observed glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222614.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and increase OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222614.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). This suggests that exogenous pyruvate is more effective in reversing the Warburg when compared to endogenous pyruvate.</p>

<title>LPS suppresses G<sub>2</sub>/M progression in THP-1 cells</title>
<p>We have previously shown that exogenous pyruvate kills breast, lung and ovarian cancer cell lines but promotes the survival of a normal fibroblast cell line. Furthermore, exogenous pyruvate protects the normal cell line from genotoxic stress caused by irinotecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref005">5</xref>]. Since monocytes are often exposed to stress caused by infectious agents, we investigated the response of THP-1 cells to LPS in order to understand the effect of superimposing infection on a cancerous monocyte. We also tested how THP-1 cells respond to exogenous pyruvate with or without LPS. The cells were treated as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222614.g002">Fig 2A&#8211;2L</xref>) and the cell cycle progression and type of cell death were measured by flow cytometry following Annexin V staining to determine the type of cell death.

<p>More functional analysis using the IMP webserver reveals two distinct functional networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222614.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). One set includes glycolysis enzymes as well as HSP90AB1 and YWHAZ (14-3-3<italic>&#950;</italic>), both of which are associated with protein-folding and promote tumour formation and cancer cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref029">29</xref>]. The other group consists of anti-apoptotic molecules, cell adhesion molecules, glucose transporters and chemokine receptors. Notably, IL-8 and RANTES are the most upregulated by LPS-mediated TLR4 activation and both appear to dominate the interactions in this group. The anti-apoptotic proteins include B-cell lymphoma 2-related protein Z1 (BCL2A1) an NF&#954;B target with strong pro-survival functions and Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha protein 3 (TNFA1P3) which inhibits TNF&#945;-mediated NF&#954;B activation and TNF-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref031">31</xref>]. In addition, this group comprises the classical glucose transporters SLC2A3 (GLUT3) which were found to mediate elevated glycolysis in colon cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref032">32</xref>] and SLC2A14 (Glut14) which is a duplication of GLUT3 and is known to be specifically expressed in testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, the software predicted interaction with the basic helix-loop-helix protein BHLHE40 which is integral to Vitamin D receptor-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref034">34</xref>] and adrenomedullin (ADM) which is implicated in initiation and propagation of inflammatory response and known to be highly upregulated in LPS-treated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref035">35</xref>]. The two group appear to be interlinked via the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), the prototypical regulator of oxygen homeostasis. Taken together, these observations suggest that the induced cytokines probably have an autocrine mechanism and may be involved in regulating metabolism and cell survival.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although, cancer cells are often exposed to infectious environments, there are still unanswered questions about how they respond to infectious agents and commensals such as bacteria. A good example of this is cancers of the colon. We investigated the response of one representative of an innate immune cell to assess the cellular responses to infection by an already cancerous cell. We have shown that TLR-4 signalling can mediate the glycolytic phenotype in THP-1 cells enhancing it when they are activated by LPS. This is accompanied by upregulation of a subset of pro-inflammatory chemokines. Furthermore, LPS appears to have an impact on cell cycle progression as THP-1 cells undergo S-phase cell cycle arrest within 24 hours after treatment. Moreover, there is minimal cell death, mainly by necrosis, in LPS-treated THP-1 cells. In contrast to non-immune cancer cell lines, perturbation of this glycolytic programme by exogenous pyruvate does not kill the THP-1 cells. Instead, cell division appears to proceed in the same manner as untreated cells. This suggests that in monocytes, modulation of the Warburg Effect may be governed by a different molecular mechanism. Alternatively, it suggests that the impact of the Warburg Effect is context-dependent.</p>
<p>We have noted that known LPS-induced cytokines such as TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, and IL-6 are not induced in our study. In previous studies, it has been shown consistently, that IL-1&#946;, TNF-&#945;. IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 are stimulated by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> LPS in THP-I cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref036">36</xref>]. However, in our study, IL-1&#946;, TNF-&#945; and IL-6 are not affected. One explanation could be that these studies used much higher concentrations (&#956;g) compared to the nanogram amounts used here. As a screening exercise, this experiment was not repeated but the upregulated cytokines were further measured by PCR whose results were consistent with ELISA in two biological replicates. It is known that LPS can induce NF&#8211;B activated gene expression using a different pathway to TNF&#945; because a dominant negative TRAF2 mutant does not inhibit it. It was also shown that LPS-induced activation in THP-1 cells does not involve the Interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) because gene expression is not inhibited by IL-1R antagonists although dominant negative mutants of molecules upstream of IKK/NF&#954;B point inhibited LPS-induced NF&#954;B activation. Thus, TLR4 was identified as the mediator of another pathway that converged at IKK/NF&#954;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to modulating the transcription of TLR4 and pro-inflammatory chemokines, we have found that LPS enhances the glycolytic phenotype of THP-1 cells and causes S-phase cell cycle arrest after 24 hours ostensibly by inhibiting G2/M progression. The mechanism by which LPS induces cell cycle arrest is still unclear. In murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM), LPS was shown to arrest the cell cycle at G<sub>1</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref038">38</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref039">39</xref>]. Although LPS induces the mutagenic free radical nitric oxide (NO) via the nitric oxide synthase 11 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref040">40</xref>], it is doubtful that NO is responsible for cell cycle arrest in macrophages. Firstly, a study designed to investigate this matter showed that LPS inhibits proliferation of NOS<sup>-/-</sup> murine BMM. Secondly, LPS-induced cell cycle arrest in wild type BMM was not reversed by a NOSII inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref038">38</xref>]. In the present study, THP-1 cells, which represent undifferentiated macrophages, are shown to accumulate at the S-phase when exposed to LPS. It has been shown that inhibition of cyclin A, cyclin E, as well as their kinase CDK-2, causes cells to accumulate at S-phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref041">41</xref>]. However, we have found no reports of LPS inhibiting these checkpoint molecules.</p>
<p>The results as shown here resemble those produced by LPS in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages whereby it inhibited proliferation of NOSII<sup>-/-</sup> mouse macrophages indicating that LPS can promote cell proliferation in the absence of nitric oxide. However, unlike the THP-1 cells, these primary macrophages underwent G1 cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we found that the exogenous pyruvate promotes cell cycle progression in THP-1 cells in contrast to non-myeloid cell lines which were previously shown to be sensitive to reversal of the Warburg Effect by exogenous pyruvate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref042">42</xref>]. Although methyl pyruvate promotes cell cycle progression in a normal cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref005">5</xref>] and in THP-1 cells as shown here, it does not unlock the G2/M cell arrest of LPS-treated THP1 cells. Moreover, enhancing endogenous pyruvate by using DCA does not alter the G<sub>2</sub>/M-phase cell cycle arrest caused by LPS. This suggests that subverting the glycolytic metabolic programme in the myeloid cell line does not activate apoptotic pathways as it does in the non-myeloid cancer cell lines.</p>
<p>Upon activation by LPS, the expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines was induced in THP-1 cells. This is interesting because myeloid lineage cells play a key role in polarizing innate and adaptive immune response through their differential chemokine expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref043">43</xref>]. The significance of the set of induced chemokines needs some evaluation. RANTES and MIP are pro-inflammatory chemokines which are ligands for the CCR5 receptor found on monocytes, macrophages, Th1 cells, activated T cells and on natural killer (NK) cells suggesting that activation of monocytes by LPS would influence these cell types. The MDC chemokine, which is involved in both pro-inflammatory and homeostatic activities is a ligand for CCR4 and is expressed on immature dendritic cells, monocytes, Th2 cells, natural killer and T skin cells. This profile then shows that LPS activation stimulates expression of 3 chemokine effectors with autocrine function. Expression of Interleukin 8, which binds to CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors on neutrophils, is also enhanced.</p>
<p>It is worth considering if this chemokine profile is related to the enhancement of the glycolytic phenotype in LPS-induced THP-1 cells. The pathway prediction study presented here suggests that LPS induces a chemokine profile that is connected to anti-apoptotic signals, cell adhesion molecules, glucose transporters and many glycolysis enzymes. BLC2A1, in particular, is expressed in haematopoietic cells to facilitate the survival of a subset of leukocytes inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref044">44</xref>]. Interestingly the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor is strongly connected to the glycolysis proteins and to many others in the second group such as adrenomedullin and the glucose transporters which are known HIF-1 targets. Although it has been reported that LPS does not induce HIF-1 in undifferentiated THP-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref023">23</xref>], it is a major role player on oxygen homeostasis and on cell survival under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222614.ref045">45</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The data presented here suggest that LPS activation of THP-1 cells enhances their glycolytic phenotype and induces a set of proinflammatory chemokines. LPS also appears to induce S-phase cell cycle arrest at least 6 hours after treatment and minimal cell death even after 24 hours. The reversal of the glycolytic phenotype by exogenous pyruvate does not affect the cells as expected. This raises some complexity about the Warburg Effect in myeloid cells. Altogether, the molecular analysis conducted here suggests that the chemokine induction is linked to glycolysis and cell survival of the LPS-activated monocytic leukaemia cell line but not to proliferation. In future studies, it is necessary to test the impact of this molecular profile on the cell cycle because the mechanism by which the observed cellular dynamics occur is not clear.</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: The authors have tried to address the role of infection on induction of metabolic program in THP-1 cells. Addressed that metabolic changes for these cells does not affect its viability and Warburg effect does not play a role. Interestingly, very few cytokines were expressed upon infection in these cells. I would like the authors to address the following concerns.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>1. I assume fig. 1a is the western blot for TLR protein. It does not seem upon induction with LPS 5ng/ml the protein does not increased while mRNA increased. How many repeats were carried out for western blot and if possible quantify after three repeats, if done.</p>
<p>2. No mention of western blot protocol in material method section. Authors has to be careful in this regard and update it.</p>
<p>3. Fig. 3a- I am not sure how many repeats were carried out for ELISA.</p>
<p>4. Fig. 3b-e &#8211; Again for western blots- I would like to see how many repeats were carried out and if possible can they quantify the western blots that can be comparable with the RT-PCR result.</p>
<p>5. This is because it is confusing for all the Figures in 3, as an example &#8211; the difference between mRNA to protein in Fig. 3b- compared to 5ng/ml+PmB to 10ng/ml LPS the mRNA level is same between these samples while the 10ng/ml LPS the protein level is high.</p>
<p>6. Similarly, for RANTES (Fig. 3C)- as by visualization 10ng/ml LPS has protein while 10ng/ml LPS with PmB no protein while the mRNA profile is different between these samples.</p>
<p>7. Thus, it is important to address this issue upon repeating western for all these genes (Fig. 3c to e) and quantify whether there is any mRNA and protein difference.</p>
<p>8. Since the authors have addressed the impact of cytokines and its linkage with downstream pathways. Why not address few genes that are linked to IL8 or RANTES by knocking down these genes to show its effect on its interactome?</p>
<p>9. I would also like to know NF kappa B expression upon these treats because it will be an important marker to show that even though NF kappa B expression increased in LPS treatment, only few of its target cytokines expression is altered.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In this manuscript, the authors analyzed cytokine production and Warburg effect induced by LPS in THP-1 AML cell line. While it is already widely known that LPS induces inflammatory cytokine production, the authors report an interesting finding in the glycolytic changes in THP-1 cells. The techniques used by the authors are sound, and the results fully demonstrate their conclusion.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: </p>
<p>1. I assume fig. 1a is the western blot for TLR protein. It does not seem upon induction with LPS 5ng/ml the protein does not increased while mRNA increased. How many repeats were carried out for western blot and if possible quantify after three repeats, if done.</p>
<p>Fig 1a is an RT-PCR showing TLR4 mRNA expression and not a Western blot. The reviewer must have made a mistake because the legend clearly indicates this. We have highlighted the section in Figure 1 legend that shows that the blots depict RT-PCR.  No repeats were performed for TLR4 expression since it is well-known that THP-1 cells express TLR4. This was just to confirm expression and induction by LPS at the low concentrations compared to published ones.  The error bars were generated accidentally because the &#8220;error bars&#8221; item was ticked off on the spreadsheet &#8220;Chart Elements&#8221; menu. We apologise for this. We generated a new graph and presented it in Fig 1a.</p>
<p>2. No mention of Western blot protocol in material method section. Authors has to be careful in this regard and update it.</p>
<p>  We did not perform any Western blot experiments. Hence, no Western blot protocol was included.</p>
<p>3. Fig. 3a- I am not sure how many repeats were carried out for ELISA</p>
<p> The ELISA assay was performed in a single experiment as a screening tool as stated in the results and discussion section of the manuscript. We validated this expression profile by using RT-PCR in two biological replicates. We are convinced about the validity of the Array result because the RT-PCR expression profile is consistent with the Array.    </p>
<p>4. Fig. 3b-e &#8211; Again for western blots- I would like to see how many repeats were carried out and if possible can they quantify the western blots that can be comparable with the RT-PCR result.</p>
<p>No Western analyses were conducted in this submission. The legend of Figure 3 indicates that there were two biological replicates (highlighted).</p>
<p>5. This is because it is confusing for all the Figures in 3, as an example &#8211; the difference between mRNA to protein in Fig. 3b- compared to 5ng/ml+PmB to 10ng/ml LPS the mRNA level is same between these samples while the 10ng/ml LPS the protein level is high.</p>
<p>No Western analyses were conducted in this submission.  The source of the confusion could be the lack of explanation for the bar graphs. We have now included in the legend that the lower panels represent quantification of the RT-PCR gels bands. They are not protein measurements.</p>
<p>6. Similarly, for RANTES (Fig. 3C)- as by visualization 10ng/ml LPS has protein while 10ng/ml LPS with PmB no protein while the mRNA profile is different between these samples.</p>
<p> No Western analyses were conducted in this submission. Please see (5) above.</p>
<p>7. Thus, it is important to address this issue upon repeating western for all these genes (Fig. 3c to e) and quantify whether there is any mRNA and protein difference.</p>
<p>No Western analyses were conducted in this submission. Please see (5) above.</p>
<p>8. Since the authors have addressed the impact of cytokines and its linkage with downstream pathways. Why not address few genes that are linked to IL8 or RANTES by knocking down these genes to show its effect on its interactome?</p>
<p>We do agree that this study reveals a broad view and complexity of the molecular pathways induced by infection in the tumour microenvironment.  However, at this stage the primary questions were about nature of the Warburg Effect in monocytes. The finer studies suggested by the reviewer are being considered for new studies where the tumour microenvironment is simulated in 3D cultures.  We do appreciate these comments because they reinforce our views about the future experiments.  </p>
<p>9. I would also like to know NF kappa B expression upon these treats because it will be an important marker to show that even though NF kappa B expression increased in LPS treatment, only few of its target cytokines expression is altered.</p>
<p>NF Kappa B regulates multiple aspects of innate immunity and has two broad mechanisms: the (i) canonical and (ii) non-canonical pathways. It is not too surprising that not all effectors known to be mediated by it are induced as its activity is contextual (temporal and cell specific). It is, however, notable that in the profile we present, the chemokines (known to be NF-Kappa B targets) are induced but the cytokines (some known known to be NF Kappa B targets) are poorly induced or not at all). We have addressed the NF kappa B influence in the discussion section. Although we appreciate the interest of the reviewer in NF kappa B expression, we do not think that a focussed study on NF kappa be would be useful in understanding the Warburg Effect at this stage. It could probably enlighten us about cytokine expression pathways &#8211; which is not the primary interest of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: </p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors analyzed cytokine production and Warburg effect induced by LPS in THP-1 AML cell line. While it is already widely known that LPS induces inflammatory cytokine production, the authors report an interesting finding in the glycolytic changes in THP-1 cells. The techniques used by the authors are sound, and the results fully demonstrate their conclusion.</p>
<p> We are grateful for these comments.</p>
