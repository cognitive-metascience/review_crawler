<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since 2011, Kenya has been evaluating ShangRing device for use in its voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) program according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Compared to conventional surgical circumcision, the ShangRing procedure is shorter, does not require suturing and gives better cosmetic outcomes. After a pilot evaluation of ShangRing in 2011, Kenya conducted an active surveillance for adverse events associated with its use from 2016&#8211;2018 to further assess its safety, uptake and to identify any operational bottlenecks to its widespread use based on data from a larger pool of procedures in routine health care settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>From December 2017 to August 2018, HIV-negative VMMC clients aged 13 years or older seeking VMMC at six sites across five counties in Kenya were offered ShangRing under injectable local anesthetic as an alternative to conventional surgical circumcision. Providers described both procedures to clients before letting them make a choice. Outcome measures recorded for clients who chose ShangRing included the proportions who were clinically eligible, had successful device placement, experienced adverse events (AEs), or failed to return for device removal. Clients failing to return for follow up were sought through phone calls, text messages or home visits to ensure removal and complete information on adverse events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Out of 3,692 eligible clients 1,079 (29.2%) chose ShangRing; of these, 11 (1.0%) were excluded due to ongoing clinical conditions, 17 (1.6%) underwent conventional surgery due to lack of appropriate device size at the time of the procedure, 97.3% (1051/1079) had ShangRing placement. Uptake of ShangRing varied from 11% to 97% across different sites. There was one severe AE, a failed ShangRing placement (0.1%) managed by conventional wound suturing, plus two moderate AEs (0.2%), post removal wound dehiscence and bleeding, that resolved without sequelae. The overall AE rate was 0.3%. All clients returned for device removal from fifth to eleventh day after placement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>ShangRing circumcision is effective and safe in the Kenyan context but its uptake varies widely in different settings. It should be rolled out under programmatic implementation for eligible males to take advantage of its unique benefits and the freedom of choice beyond conventional surgical MMC. Public education on its availability and unique advantages is necessary to optimize its uptake and to actualize the benefit of its inclusion in VMMC programs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="sec006" sec-type="intro">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Devices for medical male circumcision (MMC) have the potential to accelerate provision of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) services by reducing the time it takes to perform the procedure, simplifying the procedure thereby allowing task shifting to lower cadre health care workers and increasing uptake of MMC among men who are averse to conventional surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref001">1</xref>]. In 2011 the World Health Organization (WHO) established a program for prequalification of male circumcision (MC) devices to promote and facilitate access to safe, appropriate and affordable MC devices of good quality in an equitable manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref002">2</xref>]. This was followed in 2012 by publication of the WHO framework for clinical evaluation of devices for MC after prequalification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref003">3</xref>], which outlines the criteria and assessments that countries should fulfill before endorsing any device for widespread use in national VMMC programs for HIV prevention. The necessary assessments fall into three broad phases namely, implementation pilot, active adverse events (AE) surveillance and passive AE surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>In June 2015, WHO prequalified the ShangRing device (Wuhu SNNDA Medical Treatment Appliance Technology Co, Ltd, Wuhu City, China) for use in circumcision of adolescent and adult males ages 13 years and older after determining that it meets international standards of quality, safety and demonstrated efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref004">4</xref>]. The device consists of two concentric plastic rings, the inner of which has a silicon lined non bio reactive surface with a shallow groove on its outer surface against which the outer ring clamps to crush the foreskin when closed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref004">4</xref>]. The outer ring consists of two halves that are hinged together at one end and on the other, a ratchet mechanism for tight closure such that there is rapid compression of the foreskin between the two rings and occlusion of blood flow to distal tissues when locked. The ShangRing compression force is sufficient to prevent slippage of tissue so that the foreskin can be excised at the time of device placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on the WHO prequalification of ShangRing and results of pilot studies in Kenya and other African counties, which demonstrated its safety, ease of use and good cosmetic outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref005">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref011">11</xref>], the Kenya national VMMC technical working group endorsed its rollout under an active AE surveillance protocol. The surveillance activity was conducted according to the WHO framework for clinical evaluation of MC devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref003">3</xref>] and was consistent with similar previous initiatives, notably by Mavhu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref012">12</xref>]. The goal was to assess the feasibility of ShangRing device use in Kenya&#8217;s VMMC program based on better understanding of the potential clinical and operational challenges or opportunities associated with its widespread use in routine clinical settings. The purpose was to guide the Ministry of Health&#8217;s decision on whether to adopt ShangRing or not. The specific objectives were to (1) provide circumcision using ShangRing device as an alternative to other available methods of circumcision for males 13 years or older seeking VMMC services, (2) detect any new or rare AEs associated with ShangRing based on accumulation of a larger sample in addition to those in earlier pilot studies, (3) determine the proportion of men who choose circumcision through ShangRing device in routine VMMC service delivery settings when it is offered as an equally effective alternative to conventional surgical methods and (4) generate consumption data for different device sizes to guide forecasting of the proportions of different ShangRing device sizes to be procured to meet Kenya&#8217;s VMMC program needs.</p>

<title>Evaluation sites</title>
<p>Six health facilities offering routine VMMC services in five counties with support from PEPFAR:-Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching &amp; Referral Hospital (JOOTRH), Bondo Sub County Hospital (SCRH), Got Agulu Dispensary, Loco Dispensary, Khunyangu Sub District Hospital, Mbita District Hospital were selected to implement the active adverse events surveillance (AAES) for ShangRing circumcision in Kenya. Key criteria for site selection included (1) location within a densely populated catchment area with well-established VMMC services so travel time between service point and most clients&#8217; residences was short, (2) health care workers competent in conventional surgical MC available to be trained on the ShangRing method, and (3) access to county or sub-county referral hospitals with skilled providers to manage rare complications. These facilities were selected in five counties:-(Siaya, Kisumu, Busia, Homabay, and Nairobi) to capture variations in VMMC service delivery contexts in Kenya. Each site was to contribute about 167 procedures towards an overall target of at least 1,000 ShangRing circumcisions.</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Training</title>
<p>A total of 21 certified VMMC surgeons were trained to perform circumcision using ShangRing. The training included a 2-day didactic session covering theory, AE management and documentation plus 1-day clinical observation of procedures performed by the trainers. Subsequently, each trainee performed 8 placements and 8 removals to attain certification.</p>
<p>Non-participating health care workers within the selected health facilities and from surrounding sites were sensitized on ShangRing AAES to enable them support and refer clients appropriately. Sensitization sessions were in form of half day meetings with the management and staff of all health facilities within the target area. Trained mobilizers sensitized the general public and potential VMMC clients on the availability of ShangRing as an alternative to conventional surgical circumcision.</p>

<title>Recruitment</title>
<p>Healthy males aged 13 years or older seeking VMMC at the sites implementing ShangRing AAES or their outreach points were counseled and voluntarily tested for HIV and these testing negative were offered ShangRing as an alternative to conventional surgical MC. All ShangRing circumcisions were performed at the designated fixed sites according to eligibility criteria and guidance in the product user manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref004">4</xref>]. Clients who chose ShangRing at outreach points were transported to the fixed site for the procedure.</p>
<p>Clients who chose ShangRing but were found clinically ineligible for the device (due to conditions like adhesions and thick or short foreskins) while remaining eligible for surgery were circumcised through conventional surgery according to the WHO and Kenya clinical manual for male circumcision under local anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref014">14</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Prior to device placement, clinically eligible clients who chose ShangRing gave consent for the procedure including permission for active follow up through telephone or home visits and for use of their records in the active AE surveillance. They underwent the procedure conducted by trained clinicians using the flip technique with injectable local anesthesia per the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions for use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref004">4</xref>]. Clients were discharged with instructions to keep the wound clean and dry, abstain from sex until complete wound healing, return on day seven for device removal and to contact the clinic or return at any time in case of concerns. Clients who failed to return for device removal on day seven or any other appointment were traced actively through phone calls and text messaging starting at close of business on the date of missed appointment until the end of day eight. Clients not successfully traced by the end of day eight would be traced physically through home visits and the outcomes documented. Similar to conventional surgical circumcision, AEs were classified based on the PSI/WHO Adverse Event Action Guide for VMMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref015">15</xref>] and moderate or severe AEs were reported then included in calculations of AE rate.</p>

<list-item><p>Uptake
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Proportion of HIV uninfected males 13 years or older who chose ShangRing when offered as an alternative to conventional surgery. The numerator was all clients circumcised through ShangRing plus those screened out due to clinical ineligibility and those who missed the correct device size. The denominator used to compute uptake was the sum of HIV-negative clients aged 13 years or older circumcised conventionally or through ShangRing, screened out for clinical ineligibility and those who lacked appropriate device (presuming that all were given a choice between ShangRing and conventional surgery). Reasons for choosing or declining ShangRing were not collected because this evaluation was implemented in routine service delivery settings in conditions that were unfavorable for collection of additional elaborate information.</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>Additional outcomes collected to inform program planning included duration of procedure; time until return for removal, classified as timely (one day before until one day after the scheduled day 7 removal), early (up till five days after placement), or late (day 9 and beyond); and device size.</p>
<p>Data analysis was primarily descriptive, using totals and disaggregation as appropriate by site, client age and device specific variable including size and days from placement to removal. The relationship between device size and age was analysed using generalized additive models with a line of best fit plus confidence bands generated then overplayed on a scatter plot.</p>
<p>This surveillance activity was reviewed and approved by the Kenya ministry of Health plus the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Center for Global Health (CGH) human research protection procedures and determined to be non-research (CDC CGH HSR Tracking # D-14-2015; 2016&#8211;173).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>From December 2016 to August 2018, a total of 3,692 HIV negative males aged 13 years and older seeking VMMC at six health facilities across five counties in Kenya were offered ShangRing. Of these, 1,079 (29.2%) chose ShangRing while 2,613 opted for surgical circumcision.

<p>Out of 1,079 clients who chose ShangRing, 11 (1.0%) were screened out due to clinical reasons (1 adhesion, 2 thick foreskins; 3 short foreskins; 2 hypospadias; 1 sickle-cell disease; 1 urethral discharge and 1 genital herpes). Five out of the 11 clients found ineligible for ShangRing were however eligible for dorsal slit method and were circumcised surgically. Ten out of the 11 clients who were clinically ineligible for ShangRing were 18 years or older. Seventeen (1.6%) of ShangRing eligible clients crossed over to conventional surgery due to lack of appropriate device size at the time of the procedure. Overall, 97.4% (1,051/1,079) of the clients who chose ShangRing underwent device placement.</p>

<title>Adverse Events</title>
<p>Of the 1,051 clients who underwent ShangRing procedure, one had severe and two had moderate AEs for an overall AE rate of 0.3% (3/1,051). The first AE was a failed device placement due to incompletely locked outer ring noticed after excision of the foreskin (classified as a severe AE) managed by immediate removal of the device with completion of the procedure through conventional surgical suturing. The second AE, classified as moderate, was wound dehiscence after device removal and the third AE, also moderate, was immediate post-operative bleeding, managed through sustained application of pressure with the device in place. All AEs resolved without long term sequelae. There were no previously undescribed ShangRing related AEs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This evaluation examined the safety, uptake and overall feasibility of ShangRing device for use in Kenya&#8217;s VMMC program based on 1,051 procedures conducted in routine health care settings. Overall, the device was effective, safe, with limited operational bottlenecks for roll out but had wide variation in uptake across different sites. The results corroborate findings from previous studies in Uganda, Kenya and Zambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref010">10</xref>] which showed that the device is effective, safe and client compliance with appointments for device removal on day seven is excellent.</p>
<p>The percentage of clients for whom the device is not suitable was quantified. Only 11 (1%) of the 1,079 clients who chose ShangRing were found to be clinically ineligible for the device and of these, five were moreover eligible for surgery leaving only five clients ineligible for both ShangRing and conventional surgery. Comparable low rates of clinical ineligibility for the device have also been reported in other studies; two out of 500 (0.4%) in Zambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref016">16</xref>], one out 200 (0.25) in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref013">13</xref>] and five out of 1,211 (0.4%) men in a field study in Kenya and Zambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref009">9</xref>]. This is reassuring because only a small proportion of men will be clinically unsuitable for ShangRing circumcision as the device is rolled out, but it highlights the necessity of maintaining some availability of conventional surgical services.</p>
<p>The moderate and severe AE rate in this evaluation was low (0.3%) and corroborates reports from earlier studies across Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref014">14</xref>]; suggesting that widespread use of ShangRing in the VMMC program would be safe.</p>
<p>The ShangRing uptake rate of 29.2% observed in this evaluation is much lower than was reported in Uganda by Kigozi et al. from comparable evaluations among adults (81.8%) and adolescents (82.8%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref017">17</xref>]. Some previous studies reported high ShangRing acceptability rates based on client satisfaction with the procedure and whether they said they would recommend the procedure to friends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref011">11</xref>] which is not comparable to this evaluation. Possible explanations for the overall low uptake and its wide variation across sites (11.1%-97.2%) include variable recruitment practices across different counties with some sites only offering ShangRing at static facilities where both conventional surgery and ShangRing procedure would be performed on-site while others additionally offered ShangRing at outreach intake points from where clients would be transported to different fixed sites for the procedure. The need for transfer of ShangRing clients to a different location for placement may have discouraged clients served at outreach sites from choosing the device. The presentation of ShangRing as a different but equally effective alternative to conventional surgery rather than a superior option may not have been enough motivation for clients to switch from the widely known surgical methods to a new device. When people are offered something new and are expected to make a choice immediately, the natural tendency is to err on the side of caution. Finally, the computation of uptake is based on an assumption that all HIV negative clients aged 13 years or older who were circumcised through conventional surgery at the evaluation sites actively declined ShangRing without recording each individual&#8217;s choice; it is possible that in high demand seasons, some clients slipped through to conventional surgery without being offered ShangRing leading to underestimation of uptake.</p>
<p>Eventually, uptake of ShangRing will likely increase through information diffusion as more men experience the clinical advantages of the device such as short procedure time, absence of suturing and better cosmetic outcomes. Further, implementation of the March 2019 WHO amendment of ShangRing prequalification to include use of topical anesthesia and no-flip technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref018">18</xref>] may stimulate incremental demand from men who dislike injection and prefer a faster procedure.</p>
<p>The complete range of 18 ShangRing device sizes for adolescents and adults ranging from S (18mm) to A (40mm) were used in this evaluation with 17 (1.6%) clients missing the correct device at the time of the procedure. This was the most significant logistical challenge experienced during this AAES. The need to continuously stock all adult and adolescent device sizes may pose a challenge for procurement because the relative consumption rate of different devices sizes depends on daily service uptake by different age bands which is unpredictable. Similar challenges of device stock outs have been reported in other ShangRing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref014">14</xref>] and may require large stock of buffer supplies in the roll out phase. An important new development that addresses this challenge is the approach of using reduced number of ShangRing sizes which was evaluated by Feldblum et al. in Zambia and found to be effective and safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref016">16</xref>]. The results showed that using half the number (every other size) of adult ShangRing device sizes is sufficient for safe service delivery. WHO subsequently amended the prequalification of ShangRing in March 2019 to include availability and use of every other device size; this may alleviate some of the challenges around need to stock a large number of different devices sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222942.ref018">18</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec021">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>ShangRing uptake in this evaluation should be interpreted with caution because it is based on clients who presented for VMMC at the health facilities implementing AAES and their outreaches; uptake by the unreached broader target communities may be different.</p>
<p>The observed wide variation in uptake of ShangRing across different sites cannot be explained fully because the reasons for not choosing ShangRing were not recorded. Additional efforts combining qualitative and mixed methods are therefore recommended to explore possible reasons for low and variable uptake of ShangRing. This will guide effective demand creation for the device in areas where uptake is low.</p>
<p>Overall, a trajectory of increasing uptake for ShangRing is likely because its prequalification has been updated to include no flip technique and topical anesthesia, which may attract more clients.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the documentation of AE rate based on client-provider interaction during placement and at day 7 removal only. The protocol did not include additional visits beyond day 7 removal, therefore any AEs occurring post-removal may have been missed if the client failed to seek help at the designated ShangRing evaluation facilities. This could result in underestimation of AE rate.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>ShangRing circumcision is effective and safe in the Kenyan context and should be rolled out under programmatic implementation for men to take advantage of its unique benefits and the freedom of choice beyond conventional surgical MMC. Public education on its availability and advantages is necessary to increase its uptake and realization of public health benefits of its inclusion in VMMC programs. The WHO amendment of its prequalification in March 2019 to include its use among younger adolescents 10&#8211;12 years, application under topical anesthesia and no-flip technique may stimulate incremental demand for VMMC.</p>

<p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</p>
<p>This is a well-written manuscript describing active surveillance of the ShangRing device as per the WHO framework. I have a few comments:</p>
<p>1) In response to reviewers, authors should state that conduct of the active surveillance was consistent with the WHO framework and similar, previous initiatives (e.g. Mavhu 2016; 2019). The working definition of "acceptability" is consistent with both WHO and similar, previous initiatives. Of note active surveillance is not a study per se. Other reviewers comments are however, relevant and need to be addressed.</p>
<p>2) Possible reasons for variability in acceptability (11-97%) need to be provided. In other instances, this was because providers were actively sabotaging a device as more VMMCs in a shorter time meant less remuneration. If possible reasons are unavailable, this should be stated as a limitation and future initiatives should explore these. If it was due to absence if systematic demand creation, a recommendation would be that device-specific demand creation should be intensified and/or target those sites/communities with low acceptance.</p>
<p>3) Also, future initiatives (including qualitative/mixed methods) should explore possible reasons for not taking up ShangRing - these will be critical in informing demand-creation for the device.</p>
<p>4) Active tracing procedures need to be described in detail (see previous device active surveillance papers) - How many call/text attempts and when?</p>
<p>5) Rest of comments are editorial - most have been raised by reviewers</p>
<p>.Authors vacillate between UK &amp; US English (e.g. anesthesia/anaesthesia, program/programme, analysed) - should use one consistently</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Major comments:</p>
<p>This is an interesting paper on safety and acceptability of ShangRing in Kenya. It is clear that devices are an important part of VMMC scale up and efficiency. The paper would be of interest to your readers and is timely. The data could inform a critical component of HIV prevention programs.</p>
<p>However with the multiple purposes of this evaluation including assessment of ShangRing safety and acceptability, the authors fail to completely address that they could not demonstrably show acceptability. Safety was assessed and ShangRing demonstrated safe. An average acceptability of only 29% is poor &#8211; half of the 6 sites had acceptance rates of 25% or less. This result, in contrast to previous research, is diminished and ShangRing scale up repeatedly suggested, although premature based on these data. The abstract, discussion, and conclusions are, therefore, misleading. As acceptability was not demonstrated, the investment in training, devices, and alternatives to surgical MC for ShangRing roll out are not supported in this paper. Related, the results &#8211; only one sentence on acceptability (a major outcome) are not well balanced. It is explained in the methods and limitations that they did not collect information from clients on reasons not to want ShangRing as this was largely routine data collection; however, this major limitation should be better explained. Although they posit some potential explanations in a discussion paragraph, the lack of further exploration of this interesting result severely limits the utility of this research.</p>
<p>Attention and revision with an eye to the results on acceptability is needed to strengthen the paper. The authors should return to clinics, focal persons, or other key VMMC informants to illuminate these findings and give some further rational for this interesting result. This is the key piece of the paper that could inform scale in Kenya and the region. This would not take long and would help make the results more informative.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>Line 101: Fix references. This is distracting and poor editing: &#8220;other African counties, which demonstrated its safety, ease of use and good cosmetic outcomes [5, 6, 7, 8, 9 102 10, 11, 12], the Kenya national VMMC technical working group endorsed 103 its rollout under an active AE surveillance protocol in line with the WHO framework for clinical 104 evaluation of MC devices[Error! Bookmark not defined.].&#8221; Line 304/334 reference as well.</p>
<p>Line 114: Rephrase: It is not an &#8220;equivalent alternative.&#8221; This phrase seems misleading.</p>
<p>Line 134: Please provide more details on the training ShangRing. How long was training? How was proficiency attained? How many procedures did the trainees watch or perform? Was AE identification, treatment, management, and documentation included?</p>
<p>Please clarify. Evaluation sites were noted to be chosen for dense populations with persons living close to MC sites. However, you later note in lines 155+, that clients receiving ShangRing were transported from additional outreach intake points to the fixed sites. This seems to contradict your evaluation site criteria.</p>
<p>Line 161: This is the basis for the paper and needs more detail in this section. How was active surveillance conducted and when? Were phone calls the first line of active surveillance and then home visits? Or either? Or both? Were they triggered on Day 7 or Day 8? Please clarify the active tracing procedures.</p>
<p>Line 190: Follow up rate outcome includes outcomes of active follow up efforts for clients who failed to return for follow up. Does this include only those with observed outcomes or also those who reported outcomes by phone?</p>
<p>211: This is a large limitation to the usefulness of the study to inform scale up. &#8220;Reasons for choosing or declining ShangRing were not collected because this evaluation was implemented in routine service delivery settings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Table 2: Why do you think that Mbita District Hospital had the majority of the missing ShangRIng sizes?</p>
<p>238: The fact that acceptability of ShangRing varied widely is suggestive of highly varied recruitment or demand creation procedures. How were demand creation officers trained? How did that training vary across sites? Were the mobilizers paid to recruit? Was that the same across sites?</p>
<p>259: No need to repeat outcome measures of timing.</p>
<p>Line 267 spelling error, &#8220;avialble&#8221; is an example of the need for grammar, spacing, and spelling review throughout. There are many examples of sloppy copy editing. Another: Line 276, &#8220;and age is may have been obscured due to the small number of clients in this age bracket.&#8221; Line 330 &#8220;experienced during this AES.&#8221; Even ShangRing is not consistently spelled throughout (check your tables and figures). Many more missing punctuation and errors to be addressed that show lack of close editing review.</p>
<p>Results lines 300+. This lower acceptability seems like the major result. This paragraph could be strengthened. What different in lower and higher acceptance sites? Just urban/rural? Was it only lack of ShangRing availability at the sites? If the transportation was a factor, this also shows that the sites were poorly selected as the criteria for inclusion suggested that close proximity to sites was a reason for site selection. Please explain.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Thank you to the authors for the manuscript that focuses on the active surveillance of the Shang Ring device in Kenya across 6 sites in 5 counties. While I consider the manuscript to be valuable it does require some revision and points of clarity.</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>1. Conclusion in the abstract reads as a direct copy of the main manuscript conclusion.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>1. Where it is written medical circumcision recommend amending to read medical male circumcision (MMC) to be specific</p>
<p>2. There are sentences that require references and reference correction: end of sentence line 88, end of sentence line 92, end of sentence line 94, end of sentence line 97, reference 9 in line 102, reference error in line 104.</p>
<p>3. The authors mention that the goal of the surveillance activity was to &#8220;assess the feasibility of Shang Ring&#8230;&#8221; however, as per the WHO guidelines on evaluating medical male circumcision devices, feasibility is usually assessed during the pilot stage. Therefore, was this a true feasibility assessment? Furthermore, it is not clear what the operational challenges or opportunities were within the broader scope of the manuscript.</p>
<p>4. Were the outlined objectives representative of the overall active surveillance or the manuscript? Recommend revising these objectives to outline the aims of the manuscript under background and the active surveillance objectives can be included under the methods section. However, as it stands the presented objectives do not speak to the results of the manuscript. An example: objective (2) &#8220;detect new or rare AEs&#8230;&#8221; nothing new or rare was reported. None of the objectives clearly talk to operational challenges or operational bottlenecks. Based on the discussion, one can make the assumption that objective 4 makes reference to operational challenges however the link is not clear.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>1. Were the health facilities or counties supported by PEPFAR. Consider re-wording for clarity.</p>
<p>2. Selection criteria for sites: the authors list 3 however it reads as 4. Population density and travel time should be two separate criteria.</p>
<p>3. What was considered to be a &#8216;short&#8217; travel time between site and residence?</p>
<p>4. How did the authors define a &#8216;competent&#8217; healthcare worker in conventional surgical MMC?</p>
<p>5. The target was 167 per site, however some were under and others over? Was the target enrolment controlled across sites? Did all sites start initiation of the Shang Ring at the same time?</p>
<p>6. Under training, the authors touch on sensitization of non-participating health care workers and the general public how was this achieved, through workshops, information sessions, pamphlets&#8230;</p>
<p>7. The study only enrolled HIV uninfected clients, does this mean that clients were tested at the facility prior to being offered the Shang Ring or was HIV status considered under screening?</p>
<p>8. Line 146 to 149 is unclear, recommend rephrasing to: Clients who chose ShangRing but were found clinically ineligible for the device (due to conditions like adhesions and thick or short foreskins) while eligible for surgery were circumcised through conventional surgery according to the Kenya clinical manual for male circumcision under local anaesthesia (13).</p>
<p>9. Under procedure it mentions that clients consent to &#8220;active follow-up&#8221; however the study does not continue to follow clients after device removal. This needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>10. Provide additional information to explain why some clients had to be transported to a service delivery point to receive the Shang Ring. Was this the same at those sites for clients opting for conventional MMC?</p>
<p>11. How was wound healing determined?</p>
<p>12. There is no description of how the data was collected and captured. Were these clinic files that were reviewed daily, logs that were assessed retrospectively and where was the information captured and stored?</p>
<p>Outcome measures</p>
<p>13.1. Proportion of AEs was calculated by adding the severe and moderate not severe or moderate</p>
<p>13.2. Under outcomes: safety is reported by the AE rate, acceptability is reported by device uptake. However, it is not clear how clinical eligibility, effectiveness, follow-up rate, device placement duration are related to operational challenges.</p>
<p>13.3. Does time until return for removal fall under follow up rate? This is confusing considering that the study has no formal follow-ups</p>
<p>14. Data analysis section should be a separate paragraph</p>
<p>15. Provider experience as a measurement only features under analysis description and does not appear in the results, discussion or background. Not clear how it is relevant.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>1. The study dates in the abstract are different from the dates in the results</p>
<p>2. In line 211-212 authors provide justification for why acceptability data is not collected, this is misplaced and should be moved from results to methods.</p>
<p>3. Figure 1: 11 clinically ineligible with not description in figure for why however 17 circumcised through conventional surgery with a description for why. Be consistent with how you represent your information.</p>
<p>4. What happened to the other 6 who were ineligible for Shang Ring and conventional surgical circumcision, were they referred for care?</p>
<p>5. Move sentence &#8220;Ten out of the 11 clients who were&#8230;&#8221; (line 222-223) before sentence starting with &#8220;Seventeen (1.6%)&#8230;&#8221; (line 220)</p>
<p>6. Be consistent with decimals when reporting percentages 1.6% vs 97%</p>
<p>7. It is not clear what the authors mean by &#8220;There were no previously undescribed ShangRing related AEs&#8221; (line 250-251)</p>
<p>8. What is the significance on reporting on duration of device placement? Device placement is not included in the discussion section. Furthermore, there is no data provided on duration of device removal.</p>
<p>9. Check Table of ShangRing device sizes: in table, A4 is 36 mm while in text A4 is 40mm.</p>
<p>10. Figure 3: The distribution of device sizes by age using the scatter plot is good. As the authors describe the plot is biphasic (13-20 years) and 20+ years regarding distribution of need for different device sizes. Device size variability is required in the younger age categories.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>1. Consider re-working the sections of the discussion to follow the order in which the results are reported. Current order of results: Eligibility, Acceptability, AE, Placement duration, follow-up rate, size distribution. The discussion sections are: Eligibility, AE, Acceptability, Size.</p>
<p>2. The authors spend a considerable length of the discussion justifying the reasons for not collecting additional information on acceptability for this reason there are certain sections of the discussion that read like they should be under the &#8216;Limitations&#8217; heading. A recommendation would be to change the wording from acceptability and instead report on uptake of the ShangRing device with a future recommendation for more detailed acceptability studies to be done.</p>
<p>3. The discussion section focuses too much on the 17 cases that did not have the appropriate device sizes available. However, there is no description in the results of what these sizes were or the age categories of the clients. The manner in which the device size is represented in the discussion section renders the scatter plot irrelevant. Recommend finding a way to report on the sizes that were relevant to the active surveillance.</p>
<p>4. The discussion section would benefit from additional literature to substantiate some of the points being made by the authors.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>1. The description of no additional visits should also be reflected in the methodology</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>1. Remove references from conclusion</p>
<p>2. The WHO amendment to the prequalification is mentioned in the Limitations and Conclusions section however it is not in the Discussion section. It&#8217;s link to the overall paper is not clear.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement</p>
<p>1. Acknowledge the clients who participated in the active surveillance</p>
