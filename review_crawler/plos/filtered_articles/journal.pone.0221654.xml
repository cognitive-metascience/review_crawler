<abstract>
<p>The diagnosis of chronic wasting disease (CWD) relies on demonstration of the disease-associated misfolded CWD prion protein (PrP<sup>CWD</sup>) in brain or retropharyngeal lymph node tissue by immunodetection methods, e.g. ELISA and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The success of these methods relies on a quality sample of tissues, which requires both anatomical knowledge and considerable dissection to collect. As the prevalence of CWD continues to increase globally, the development of fast and cost-effective methods to detect the disease is vital to facilitate CWD detection and surveillance. To address these issues, we have evaluated third eyelids from CWD-infected deer and elk using real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC). We identified prion seeding activity in third eyelids in 24 of 25 (96%) CWD-infected white-tailed deer (<italic>Odocoileus virginianus</italic>). We detected RT-QuIC positivity in the third eyelid as early as 1 month after experimental CWD exposure. In addition, we identified prion seeding activity in third eyelids of 18 of 25 (72%) naturally exposed asymptomatic CWD-positive rocky mountain elk (<italic>Cervus canadensis nelson</italic>). We compared CWD detection by RT-QuIC and IHC in third eyelid, retropharyngeal lymph node, and brain in 10 deer in early symptomatic stage of disease. IHC detected PrP<sup>CWD</sup> deposition in third eyelid lymphoid follicles in 5 of 10 deer (50%) whereas third eyelids of all 10 animals were positive by RT-QuIC. This difference reflected in part a lower requirement for lymphoid follicle presence for seeding activity detection by RT-QuIC. In conclusion, RT-QuIC analysis of the third eyelid, an easily accessed tissue, has potential to advance CWD detection and testing compliance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a fatal contagious prion disease affecting cervid species (deer, elk, and moose) that is characterized by neurodegeneration, emaciation, and abnormal behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref001">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref005">5</xref>]. CWD, first identified in Colorado, now is found in North America, South Korea, and Scandinavia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref003">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref005">5</xref>]. Natural infection and transmission likely occurs through oral and nasal mucosal contact with infectious prions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref006">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref011">11</xref>]. Disease begins when the infectious prion induces continuous misfolding of the normal cellular protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into a disease-associated, protease-resistant form (PrP<sup>RES</sup>) which aggregates into amyloid fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref012">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref014">14</xref>]. In several prion diseases, including scrapie in sheep and CWD in cervids, prions accumulate first in the systemic lymphoid tissues before entering the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref015">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref017">17</xref>]. Polymorphisms in the <italic>PRNP</italic> gene sequence (most notably G96S in deer and M132L in elk) are known to prolong the disease course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref018">18</xref>]. The more common <italic>PRNP</italic> G96G and M132M genotypes are the most common polymorphisms and are associated with higher frequencies of CWD infection in deer and elk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>The standard diagnosis of CWD is identification of CWD protease resistant prion protein (PrP<sup>CWD</sup>) by immunodetection methods such as ELISA and IHC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref021">21</xref>]. More recently developed real-time seeding and amyloid amplification methods have increased CWD detection sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref022">22</xref>]. In real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC) a prion seed converts recombinant normal prion protein, PrP<sup>C</sup>, into amyloid fibrils, an event detectable by the binding of thioflavin T (ThT). Alternating cycles of incubation and shaking are used to facilitate fibril fragmentation and re-seeding, thus amplifying minute amounts of prion seed to a detectable level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref023">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref025">25</xref>]. Previous studies have validated RT-QuIC for the identification of PrP<sup>CWD</sup> in brain, lymph nodes, and other tissues, as well as in secretions and excretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>The increasing prevalence of CWD globally makes critical the development of fast, cost-effective methods to detect the disease in deer and assist with disease management. The third eyelid is a nictitating membrane found in many animal species located between the globe of the eye and the lower eyelid, thereby easily accessible without special anatomical training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref026">26</xref>]. In ruminants, including cervids, the membrane contains lymphoid tissue organized into the lymphoid follicles with germinal centers where prion protein can accumulate at early stages of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref027">27</xref>]. Here we have explored the potential of the third eyelid for rapid detection of CWD infection, based on the work of O&#8217;Rourke et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref029">29</xref>] for detection of scrapie in sheep. We use both RT-QuIC and IHC examination of third eyelids to detect CWD infection in symptomatic and pre-symptomatic white-tailed deer and rocky mountain elk to demonstrate the utility of this accessible tissue for rapid diagnosis of CWD in cervids.</p>

<title>RT-QuIC analysis of third eyelids from symptomatic deer</title>
<p>To evaluate whether RT-QuIC could detect CWD in third eyelid tissue, we examined third eyelids collected at necropsy from n = 25 white-tailed deer (WTD) experimentally exposed to CWD-positive saliva or brain homogenate, usually by the oral, or in one study, the aerosol route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref027">27</xref>]. Dose protocols included oral inoculation of either: (a) 300ng, 0.001g, 0.01g, or 1.0g of CWD-positive brain homogenate; or (b) 30 mL of CWD-positive saliva containing 300ng brain equivalent seeding activity in RT-QuIC; or (c) aerosolization of 0.1g of CWD-positive brain homogenate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref031">31</xref>]. CWD infection was confirmed in all of these animals by IHC detection of PrP<sup>CWD</sup> in the obex region of the brain and the retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RPLN). Third eyelid homogenates from 20 of 21 deer (95%) containing the <italic>PRNP</italic> codon 96GG genotype displayed significant amyloid seeding activity by RT-QuIC (****p &lt; 0.0001, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test vs. negative control eyelids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221654.g001">Fig 1A&#8211;1D</xref>). The same 21 deer also were positive for RT-QuIC seeding activity in obex and RPLN. Third eyelids from the 4 deer of 96GS genotype also demonstrated significant amyloid seeding activity by RT-QuIC (****p &lt; 0.0001, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221654.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and were likewise positive in systemic tissues. False positive wells in negative control third eyelids were well below a level of significance (2 false positive replicates of 44 total replicates (4.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221654.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). These results demonstrated that the third eyelid can be used in RT-QuIC assay to consistently detect PrP<sup>CWD</sup> amyloid seeding activity from a variety of CWD-infected, symptomatic WTD with little false positivity. Additionally, we found that detection of amyloid seeding activity in the third eyelid is not confined to 96GG genotype, demonstrated by the seeding activity found in all four 96GS deer.</p>

Despite RT-QuIC identifying PrP<sup>CWD</sup> seeding activity in third eyelids of 20 of 21 (95%), only 5 of the 10 (50%) third eyelid samples demonstrated PrP<sup>CWD</sup> immunoreactivity in germinal centers of the limited number of lymphoid follicles present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221654.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221654.t001">Table 1</xref>). Clear PrP<sup>CWD</sup> staining was seen in follicles of the third eyelid and RPLN and larger aggregate plaques were present in the obex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221654.g002">Fig 2</xref>). These results demonstrated that RT-QuIC detection of seeding activity in third eyelids from CWD-infected, symptomatic WTD correlated with IHC positivity in retropharyngeal lymph node and brain obex samples. Additionally, IHC showed less consistent detection in the third eyelid when compared with RT-QuIC, in part due to insufficient presence of lymphoid follicles in the tissue.</p>

<title>RT-QuIC analysis of third eyelids from pre-symptomatic deer</title>
<p>In order to determine whether third eyelids accumulated PrP<sup>CWD</sup> early in the disease course, we evaluated samples from two groups of asymptomatic deer. The first group of pre-symptomatic deer were collected 1 to 4 months after oral CWD inoculation (0.5 g of CWD-positive brain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref015">15</xref>]. In these deer, RT-QuIC seeding activity and IHC immunoreactivity was detected in upper alimentary tract lymphoid tissues as early as 1-month post-inoculation but was not detected in the obex region of the brain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221654.t002">Table 2</xref>). In one 96GG deer at 1-month post-inoculation (MPI) and 4 of 8 96GG additional deer at 2, 3, and 4 MPI, third eyelids contained significant amyloid seeding activity (*p &lt; 0.05, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221654.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221654.t002">Table 2</xref>). In n = 3 96GS deer, PrP<sup>CWD</sup> was not significantly detected in third eyelids at these same early time points. This latter disparity likely reflects the slower disease onset and course in this genotype as seeding activity was also not detected in retropharyngeal lymph nodes of these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221654.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221654.t002">Table 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref015">15</xref>]. These results demonstrated that in addition to detecting significant third eyelid amyloid seeding activity at early time points in 96GG deer, detection was also possible in the third eyelid of an asymptomatic 96SS genotype deer.</p>

<title>Detection of PrP<sup>CWD</sup> in third eyelids of pre-symptomatic deer by RT-QuIC.</title>
<p>CWD prions were detected by RT-QuIC in the third eyelid of a 96GG deer as early as 1 month post-inoculation. RT-QuIC analysis of 96GG negative-control (black), 96GG (blue), 96GS (red), and 96SS (green) third eyelids collected in chronological order of months post-inoculation (MPI). 6 samples displayed statistically significant RT-QuIC amyloid seeding: 1219, 1218, 1207, 1203, 1215, and 1205 (****p &lt; 0.0001, ***p &lt; 0.001, **p &lt; 0.01, *p &lt; 0.05, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) when compared with respective negative control tissues. Each third eyelid sample is represented by the mean and standard deviation from at least eight replicate wells.</p>

<title>RT-QuIC analysis of third eyelids from asymptomatic elk</title>
<p>To investigate whether PrP<sup>CWD</sup> accumulates in third eyelids of other cervid species, we examined samples from asymptomatic, naturally exposed elk.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The work of O&#8217;Rourke and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref005">5</xref>] demonstrated that scrapie prions can accumulate in third eyelid lymphoid germinal centers and constitute a USDA-approved method for scrapie diagnosis in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref029">29</xref>]. We show here that the seeding of the third eyelid in deer may be a basis for detection of CWD as well. RT-QuIC detected CWD seeding activity in third eyelids as early as one month post inoculation and in most (28/29) deer and elk that were IHC positive in both obex and RPLN, even if they were not displaying clinical signs. In the present study, detection of CWD by IHC on third eyelids of deer was less sensitive (8/15) compared with detection of scrapie in sheep wherein 41/42 samples were positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref028">28</xref>]. There are several potential reasons for the detection discrepancy between these two methods in deer. One is that RT-QuIC employs whole homogenized samples, which increases the possibility that lymphoid content is included in the sample. Another is that lymphoid follicles are usually required for unequivocal IHC detection, which was compromised when follicle number was low. Finally, previous studies have demonstrated that RT-QuIC can enhance CWD detection in tissues or excreta samples in which prion concentrations are quite low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref022">22</xref>]. Thereby, the amplification provided by RT-QuIC may account for increased detection sensitivity in eyelids as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>We observed higher CWD prion detection in deer eyelid samples compared with elk samples. One potential reason for this is that the elk samples used in this study were collected from asymptomatic elk in a CWD-infected herd involved in a herd management program and thereby a variety of early infection states may be been represented. By contrast, the majority of the deer used for this study were in or approaching a symptomatic disease state. In addition, previous investigations into CWD pathogenesis found greater PrP<sup>CWD</sup> accumulation in lymphoid tissues of infected deer than do elk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref033">33</xref>]. Deer also display a greater distribution of PrP<sup>CWD</sup> in lymphoid tissues compared with elk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221654.ref034">34</xref>]. Such species differences in prion lymphoid tissue accumulation may contribute to the variation in third eyelid detection and highlight the advantage of more sensitive testing methods in herd management programs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that RT-QuIC performed on third eyelid tissue can be used to detect CWD in deer and elk, including those in pre-symptomatic stages of infection. As third eyelid is an easily accessible tissue, it has potential to aid in surveillance and screening programs.</p>

<title>Deer tissue collection and processing</title>
<p>Each tissue was collected at necropsy with separate prion-free instruments and were divided into two halves; one-half was stored at -80&#8201;&#176;C and the other half was fixed in periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) before being transferred to 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 70% ethanol for long-term storage. Following fixation, tissues were trimmed and placed in histology cassettes, for processing into paraffin-embedded blocks. Third eyelids were trimmed longitudinally from the apical part of the tissue in proximity to where lymphoid tissue is located. The dissected third eyelid tissues were homogenized at 10% (wt/vol) in 1X PBS using a Bead Ruptor 24 (Omni International). The homogenates were stored at -80&#8201;&#176;C until further use.</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript applies the third eyelid assay for prions (previously described for scrapie-infected sheep) to the detection of CWD in deer, adding RT-QuIC as a means to enhance detection. The test shows relatively good sensitivity in clinical deer with the 96GG Prnp genotype. The test is less effective in preclinical animals, particularly those with polymorphisms at amino acid 96.</p>
<p>1) A table comparing all the samples would be very helpful (providing times post-infection or symptomatic/pre-symptomatic) to clarify all the various incubation periods/genotypes etc.</p>
<p>2) Were any live animals tested? Will this assay work as an ante-mortem test?</p>
<p>3) Any thoughts as to why the seeding activity is much higher in GS and SS than GG third eyelids late in the disease course but not detectable in the early samples? Does this affect the utility of the test on field samples?</p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>Line 141-142: The sentence "However, RT-QuIC analysis..." needs rewriting, it is awkwardly phrased.</p>
<p>Line 252: Clarification needed--was the test performed by the USDA or just required to be done by the USDA?</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This study is proposed to diagnose CWD in deer by detecting accumulation of disease associated PrPCWD in the 3rd eyelid lymphoid follicles by RT-QuIC to ease the sample collection protocol over the current protocol which requires detailed anatomical knowledge and dissection skills to collect precise retrophyngeal lymph node tissues. This study showed that PrPCWD detection as early as one month after inoculation of CWD inoculated deer in the 3rd eyelid by RT-QuIC. Interestingly, CWD infected deer with 96GG started accumulating PrPCWD earlier than CWD infected deer with 96GS in the 3rd eyelid. This finding might be expanded in future to address whether the 3rd eyelid is appropriate test samples for all types of CWD infected deer or deer with specific genotypes.</p>
<p>Even though this is an interesting study, insufficient labels and explanations of the figures and table, it is hard to understand the data. For instance, in abstract, line 36 -37 &#8221;IHC detected&#8230;5 of 10 deer (50%) whereas third eyelids of all these animals&#8230;&#8221;, which data shows 5/10 by IHC and 10/10 by RT-QuIC in the third eyelids in clinical deer?</p>
<p>In Introduction, add a rational(s) behind comparing 96GG, GS, and SS genotypes in CWD disease development in deer.</p>
<p>Line 48-50, &#8220; Disease begins when &#8230;. (PrPC) into a disease-associated, protease-resistant form (PrPCWD) which&#8230;.&#8221; This is a general definition of PrPRES, and references sited here (12-14) are also covered a general term. So change PrPCWD to PrPRES and add another sentence to define PrPCWD, which is PrPRES found in CWD infected corvid.</p>
<p>Line 64 &#8220;&#8230;the third eyelid, a nictitating membrane found in&#8230;.&#8221; after defined what is the third eyelid, use one for the rest of the manuscript. For example, Line 65-69 used &#8220;the third eyelid&#8221; and line 70 used &#8220;nictitating membrane&#8221; in the same paragraph. Line 120 is another example. Please check the entire manuscript to be consistent in terminology.</p>
<p>Results, request to improve figure and table labels and legends in order to easily understand data.</p>

<p>- Figure 1 B-E, which samples are 96GG or GS? If all GG, explain.</p>

<p>Dr. Byron Caughey</p>
<p>Academic Editor, PLOS ONE </p>
<p>Re. ms. #PONE-D-19-16699</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Caughey:</p>
<p>We thank the reviewers for their comments and suggestions for revision of this manuscript.  We have addressed each comment in the text below and made pertinent changes to the manuscript in accord with their comments.</p>
<p>Our responses are in italics after each reviewer comment.</p>
<p>Reviewer 1:</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 1: A table comparing all the samples would be very helpful (providing times post-infection or symptomatic/pre-symptomatic) to clarify all the various incubation periods/genotypes etc.</p>
<p>Response 1: These points are well taken.  We have accordingly replaced Table 1 with Table 2 to include these comparisons to clarify all incubation periods, genotypes, and clinical status.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 2:  Were any live animals tested? Will this assay work as an ante-mortem test?</p>
<p>Response 2:  Good question.  We did not test live animals as it was important not to risk any negative consequences for longitudinal studies.  We suspect the assay would work for live animals using biopsy methods similar to those in O&#8217;Rourke et al. 2002 with sheep.  For use with RT-QuIC or other amplification assay, new or prion decontaminated instruments and probably short general anesthesia would be required for deer.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 3: Any thoughts as to why the seeding activity is much higher in GS and SS than GG third eyelids late in the disease course but not detectable in the early samples? Does this affect the utility of the test on field samples?</p>
<p>Response 3: Based on the low number of especially GS animals tested in this study, we are hesitant to conclude the pattern observed is representative overall.  The overall similar pattern of systemic lymphoid tissue involvement in 96GG and GS deer also might suggest that this might also be expected for the lymphoid tissue in the nictitating membrane.  We also would suspect that less frequent detection of seeding activity in would be expected for early samples from GS or SS deer. </p>
<p>Minor points: </p>
<p>Comment: Line 141-142: The sentence "However, RT-QuIC analysis..." needs rewriting, it is awkwardly phrased.</p>
<p>Response:  We agree. The wording has been improved to match the syntax of the rest of the paper.</p>
<p>Comment:  Line 252: Clarification needed--was the test performed by the USDA or just required to be done by the USDA?</p>
<p>Response: The sentence was restructured to clarify the test was performed and required by the USDA.</p>
<p>Reviewer 2: </p>
<p>Reviewer 2, comment 1: Even though this is an interesting study, insufficient labels and explanations of the figures and table, it is hard to understand the data. For instance, in abstract, line 36 -37 &#8221;IHC detected&#8230;5 of 10 deer (50%) whereas third eyelids of all these animals&#8230;&#8221;, which data shows 5/10 by IHC and 10/10 by RT-QuIC in the third eyelids in clinical deer?</p>
<p>Response 1: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this lack of clarity. We have accordingly added an additional table to more clearly demonstrate the data described in line 36-37. More specific labels and explanations have been added to all figures and tables to clarify the data presentation. </p>
<p>Reviewer comment 2: In Introduction, add a rational(s) behind comparing 96GG, GS, and SS genotypes in CWD disease development in deer.</p>
<p>Response 2: In the Introduction we have clarified the importance of genotypes of deer and elk as these polymorphisms pertain to CWD disease development in cervids. (Lines 50 to 54).</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 3: Line 48-50, &#8220; Disease begins when &#8230;. (PrPC) into a disease-associated, protease-resistant form (PrPCWD) which&#8230;.&#8221; This is a general definition of PrPRES, and references sited here (12-14) are also covered a general term. So change PrPCWD to PrPRES and add another sentence to define PrPCWD, which is PrPRES found in CWD infected cervid.</p>
<p>Response 3:  We appreciate this comment and have adjusted the text referred to in lines 12-14 to properly define PrPCWD.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 4: Line 64 &#8220;&#8230;the third eyelid, a nictitating membrane found in&#8230;.&#8221; after defined what is the third eyelid, use one for the rest of the manuscript. For example, Line 65-69 used &#8220;the third eyelid&#8221; and line 70 used &#8220;nictitating membrane&#8221; in the same paragraph. Line 120 is another example. Please check the entire manuscript to be consistent in terminology.</p>
<p>Response 4: All uses of nictitating membrane have been replaced with third eyelid to maintain consistent terminology.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 5: Results, request to improve figure and table labels and legends in order to easily understand data.</p>
<p>Response 5: Thank you.  Figure and table labels have been added and improved and legends have been made more specific to improve clarity. </p>
<p>Reviewer comment 6: Figure1A-E</p>
<p>- Explain what was compared using two-tailed Mann-Whitney test?</p>
<p>- Figure 1 B-E, which samples are 96GG or GS? If all GG, explain.</p>
<p>Response 6: Thank you.  We have adjusted each figure legend to clarify what was compared to determine statistical significance. Genotypes have been added to each section of the figure.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 7: Figure 1B</p>
<p>- 812 looked like a negative control in Fig 1E, are there any reasons behind? Explain.</p>
<p>Response 7: Other tissues of this animal were unequivocally positive for seeding activity and PrPRES.  So other than individual animal variation, we do not know the reason why 812 looked like a negative control (i.e. negative) based on third eyelid analysis.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 8: Line 91 define an abbreviation first time you use, &#8220;Brain per os,&#8221; oral administration</p>
<p>Response 8: A definition for &#8216;brain per os&#8217; has been added.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 9: Line 100-102, hard to follow. Please make points clear.</p>
<p>Response 9: The sentence in question has been re-written to improve clarity. (Lines 116 to 118).</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 10: Line 102 &#8220;&#8230;in the RPLN, obex, and the third eyelid.&#8221; Be consistent in order of the Figure 2, &#8220; the obex, RPLN, and third eyelid&#8230;&#8221; or change the order of the IHC images.</p>
<p>Response 10: The order of text has been changed to be consistent with the order displayed in Figure 2.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 11: Line117-119, adding the genotype GG, GS, SS labels to Table 1 will help to understand &#8220;4 of 8 96GG deer&#8221; data in the table.</p>
<p>Response 11: Thank you for this comment.  We have replaced Table 1 with Table 2 to clarify all incubation periods, genotypes, and clinical status.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 12: Figure 3, report significant values for one star, three stars and four stars.</p>
<p>Response 12: Significant values for 1-4 stars have been reported and added to each figure legend.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 13: Line285-289, &#8220;A two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was&#8230; to corresponding negative controls.&#8221; and p-values should be in figure legend.</p>
<p>Response 13: A more specific explanation of the statistics performed have been added to each figure legend.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 14: Explain case 1305 in Figure 4 for lower seeding activity unlike others</p>
<p>Response 14: The lower seeding activity in the third eyelid of animal 1305 we presume to reflect an earlier stage of infection.  Unlike other animals in this group, 1305 was positive by IHC only in the retropharyngeal lymph node, whereas other animals in this cohort were IHC-positive in not only in retropharyngeal lymph nodes, but also in other systemic lymph nodes, and the brain.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 15: Figure 5 and its results section needs to be improved.</p>
<p>Response 15: Figure 5 and its results section (lines 203 to 224) have been revised to improve clarity. </p>
<p>Reviewer comment 16: The first paragraph in Discussion should be in Introduction.</p>
<p>Response 16: The first paragraph in the Discussion was removed and important aspects were added to the Introduction. (Lines 65 to 70).</p>
<p>Finally, as requested, here we provide additional information in regard to the Funding Statement and Competing Interests Statement.  Dr. Clare E. Hoover is currently employed by a commercial company, AstraZeneca.  However, this company played no role in this study, did not provide funding for Dr. Clare Hoover&#8217;s salary when this work was conducted ,nor did AstraZeneca have any role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, nor preparation of the manuscript.  The specific roles of this author are articulated in the &#8216;author contributions&#8217; section.&#8221; This does not alter our adherence to PLoS One policies on sharing data and materials.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to submit our revised manuscript for your further consideration for publication in PLoS One.</p>
