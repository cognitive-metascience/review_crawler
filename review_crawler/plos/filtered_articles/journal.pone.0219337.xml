<abstract>
<p>The dissemination of resistant pathogenic microbes has become one of the most challenging problems that modern medicine has faced. Developing novel drugs based on new molecular targets that previously were not targeted, is therefore the highest priority in antibiotics research. One approach that has been recently suggested is to inhibit copper transporters in prokaryotic systems. Copper is required for many biological pathways, but sometimes it can harm the cell. Pathogenic systems have a highly sophisticated copper-regulation network; therefore, a better understanding of how this network operates at the molecular level should assist in developing the next generation of antibiotics. The CusB protein is part of the CusCBA periplasmic Cu(I) efflux system in Gram-negative bacteria, and was recently reported to play a key role in the functioning of the whole CusCBA system, in which conformational changes as well as the assembly/disassembly process control the opening of the transporter. More knowledge of the underlying mechanism is needed to attain a full understanding of CusB functioning, which is associated with targeting specific and crucial residues in CusB. Here, we combine in-vitro structural measurements, which use EPR spectroscopy and UV-Vis measurements, with cell experiments to explore the role of the various methionine residues in CusB. We targeted two methionine residues (M227 and M241) that are essential for the proper functioning of CusB.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Copper is an essential nutrient for aerobic organisms; its ability to exchange electrons as it cycles between cuprous and cupric states has been harnessed by enzymes that catalyze a wide variety of biochemical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref002">2</xref>]. However, this redox activity also confers copper with toxic properties when it is present in the free ionic form: free copper can participate in Fenton-like chemical reactions to generate the highly toxic hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide and superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref003">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref005">5</xref>]. Owing to its toxicity, copper has been known as an antimicrobial agent for thousands of years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref006">6</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising that microbes have developed tightly regulated mechanisms for copper transport and intracellular distribution, to maintain negligible changes (subfemtomolar concentrations) in their intracellular levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref007">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref009">9</xref>]. Selective inhibition of the copper efflux in microbes is expected to raise their copper levels, accelerate the Fenton reaction, and augment the production of free radicals. Ultimately, this chain of events kills the microbes.</p>
<p>Four different mechanisms regulate cellular Cu(I) in prokaryotic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref010">10</xref>]: (i) the cytoplasmic CueR- metal sensor initiates the transcription process of CueO and CopA associated with Cu(I) coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref011">11</xref>]; (ii) CopA uses the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to drive the efflux of Cu(I) from the cytoplasm to the periplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref012">12</xref>]; (iii) CusF, a metallochaperone, transfers Cu(I) from CopA to the CusCBA efflux system, which pumps Cu(I) from the periplasm to the extracellular region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref013">13</xref>]; and (iv) CueO oxidizes Cu(I) to its less toxic oxidation state, Cu(II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref014">14</xref>]. Although homologs of CopA and CueO also exist in the human cells ATP7b and SOD, respectively, the CusCFBA and CueR systems are unique to prokaryotic systems. Thus, targeting the latter two copper transport systems with antibiotics might be very beneficial in terms of freedom from an antibiotic effect on human copper-transport systems. CueR is a metal sensor that senses the Cu(I) ion with high affinity and induces a transcription process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref015">15</xref>]. Metal sensors such as CueR exist in all microbes, but their structure and functionality vary among microbe types. In contrast, Cus efflux systems are found in many pathogenic microbes such as Legionella, Salmonella, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and many other Gram-negative bacteria. The sequence identity among all species is about 30%, and their structures and functions should be similar in all microbes.</p>
<p>The Cus complex comprises an inner membrane proton-substrate carrier (CusA) and an outer membrane protein (CusC). The inner and the outer membrane proteins are connected by a linker protein, CusB, in the periplasm, which is composed of CusA:CusB:CusC in a oligomerization ratio of 3:6:3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref016">16</xref>]. Owing to the large size of the system, the structure of the entire complex has not been elucidated; however, the crystal structures of the individual components (CusC, CusA, and CusB) and the CusBA complex have been determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref017">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref019">19</xref>]. Padilla-Benavides <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref020">20</xref>] have successfully demonstrated a specific interaction between the CopA transporter extracellular domain and CusF. Based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Chac&#243;n <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref021">21</xref>] suggested that the CusB-CusF interaction functions as a switch for the entire Cus efflux system and facilitates the transfer of copper to the CusA component. Taken together, these findings indicate that in the periplasm, Cu(I) is transferred from CopA to CusF and then to the CusCBA complex through direct and specific interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The crystal structure of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> CusB indicates that the protein is folded into an elongated narrow structure that comprises four domains with a flexible hinge between domains 2 and 3 of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref018">18</xref>]. Recently, we used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy-based nanometer distance measurements to show that CusB undergoes major structural changes associated with Cu(I) binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref022">22</xref>]; this results in two structures for the CusB dimer in solution: apo-CusB and holo-CusB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The EPR data suggests a more compact structure upon Cu(I) binding, in agreement with the gel filtration chromatography experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref023">23</xref>]. Moreover, Chen <italic>et al</italic>. showed that under copper stress, CusB changes its conformation and shifts the equilibrium from a disassembled CusCBA complex to an assembled one. Methionine residues in the CusB play a critical part in Cu(I) binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref024">24</xref>]. Bagai <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that four out of ten methionine residues (M49, M64, M66, and M311) in CusB are conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref023">23</xref>]. Moreover, the crystal structure suggests that there are two methionine residues ((i) M190, domain 4, and (ii) M324, domain 1), which are not conserved, yet take part in Cu(I) binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref018">18</xref>]. The most studied region in CusB is the N-terminal domain (CusB_NT), which comprises 60 amino acids (residues 28&#8211;88) that were shown to interact directly with CusF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref025">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref027">27</xref>]. Studies on CusB knockout (&#916;CusB) and CusB&#916;NT have revealed a Cu(I)-sensitive phenotype in cells and indicated that M64 and M66 of CusB_NT are important residues, both for Cu(I) coordination to CusB_NT as well as for its interaction with CusF, whereas M49 of CusB_NT is important for interacting with CusF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref026">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref028">28</xref>]. Coupled with various constructs of &#916;CusB, the McEvoy group found that CusB_NT is not fully functional by itself without the remaining part of the protein, and ruled out the idea that CusB acts only as a metal chelator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref026">26</xref>]. They found that it is also involved in conformational changes resulting in a more compact form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref023">23</xref>]. To date, Cu(I) binding sites in domain 2 and domain 3 of the CusB have not been reported. Since this region was found to undergo structural changes upon Cu(I) binding, we suspect that there may be additional Cu(I) sites that have not been targeted yet.</p>

<p>In the present study, we use a combination of in-vitro spectroscopic measurements and cell experiments to study the significance of each single methionine residue in CusB and its effect on cell survival. We demonstrate that two additional methionine residues of CusB, namely M227 (Domain 3), and M241 (Domain 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), are essential for cell growth and viability. Pulsed EPR spectroscopy confirms that the conformational changes in CusB, which were associated with Cu(I) binding, depend on these Met residues. This study emphasizes the role of domains 2 and 3 of CusB in the functioning of CusCBA transporter and regulation of in-cell copper concentration.</p>

<title>Copper stress in CusB mutants during cell growth</title>
<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the various Cu(I) binding sites in CusB; we hypothesized that deletion of single methionine (Met) residues in CusB, which possibly play a role either in Cu(I) coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref025">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref027">27</xref>] in the Cus channel assembly process, or in the transfer mechanism, may also affect cell viability upon Cu(I) stress. Ten Met residues exist in CusB; in order to determine which of them are essential for cell growth, each time one methionine residue was mutated to isoleucine. Initially, we knocked out CusB (&#916;CusB) in the native <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells and then transformed either WT or a mutated gene into the knocked out cells. The protein expression level was identical for all clones; therefore, we could compare the growth rates of the various mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219337.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We used Cu(II) in the cell experiments because it can penetrate into the cell and is reduced to Cu(I) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219337.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219337.s003">S3</xref> Figs). However, our conditions are not fully anaerobic; therefore, we also repeated the experiments in the presence of Cu(I), and the results were found to be similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219337.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219337.s005">S5</xref> Figs). This indicates that Cu(II) was reduced to Cu(I). The various clones were grown in M9 medium for 16 hr and their cell growth was compared in the absence and presence of Cu(II) in the medium. Growth rate values after 14 hr of cell growth for various CusB clones are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g002">Fig 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The ability of wild-type (WT) CusB to grow under Cu(II) stress was found to be 3 &#177; 0.4% less than in the absence of Cu(II) after 14 hr of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We also monitored the cell growth of each single mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g002">Fig 2</xref>). All mutants grew less well than WT-CusB even before adding Cu(II) to the growth solution, due to the slight effect of the minimal copper concentration naturally present in the M9 bacterial growth medium (0.5 &#956;M), and the significance of the methionine residues in CusB for preserving copper homeostasis. However, the cell growth experiments succeeded in targeting three Met residues that mostly affect the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cell growth after 14 hr under Cu(II) stress: CusB_M64I &#8211;a reduction of 30 &#177; 3%; CusB_M241I &#8211;a reduction of 25 &#177; 4%, and CusB M227I &#8211;a reduction of 18 &#177; 3%. CusB_M398I resulted in a reduction of 7 &#177; 2% after 14 hr with 3 &#956;M Cu(II), which was the largest reduction among the remaining clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g002">Fig 2</xref>). All other mutants affected cell growth by less than 5%. M11I shows the lowest effect on the growth rate as expected, since it is located in CusB signal (residues 1&#8211;28) peptide which is cleaved upon maturation, suggesting that M11I does not affect this cleavage process. Interestingly, in comparison with previous results, smaller reductions in growth rate were observed for the conserved methionine residues and for the M190 and M324 residues, which were suggested to play a role in Cu(I) binding by crystallography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref026">26</xref>]. In addition, previous in-vitro ITC measurements were not able to detect the functionality of M227 and M241 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref023">23</xref>]. Based on the cell experiments, we decided to focus on the four methionine residues which showed the largest effect on the growth rate, and may therefore form additional Cu(I) sites that were not identified earlier.</p>

<title>Targeting conformational changes in CusB mutants by DEER measurements</title>
<p>Over the last decade, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, coupled with site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), has been found to be an excellent means of obtaining structural and dynamic information on complex systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref029">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref036">36</xref>]. Hubbell <italic>et al</italic>. were the first to introduce the SDSL methodology in which they attached nitroxide spin labels to cysteine residues at selected positions within the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref038">38</xref>]; the most commonly used nitroxide spin label is the 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSSL). The DEER technique, also called pulsed electron double resonance (PELDOR), is a pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique used to measure dipolar interactions between two or more electron spins. Thus, it can provide nanometer-scale interspin distance information in the range of 1.5&#8211;8.0 nm. By using DEER and SDSL, we recently succeeded in targeting conformational changes in WT-CusB associated with Cu(I) binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref022">22</xref>]. We showed that CusB assumed a more compact structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) upon Cu(I) binding, whereas most of the structural changes occurred in CusB domains 2 and 3. In order to explore the effect of methionine mutations on CusB conformation, we spin-labeled the protein at two sites: one at A236C (domain 3) and the second at A248C (domain 2). The DEER time domain signals are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and the corresponding distance distribution functions are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g003">Fig 3B</xref>. Because CusB was found to be a dimer in solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref022">22</xref>], the distance distribution consists of all distances derived from the four spin-labels attached to the CusB dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). For WT-CusB, distance distributions of 2.5 &#177; 0.5 nm for the apo-state and 2.8 &#177; 0.3 nm for the holo-state (CusB+Cu(I)) were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To compare the DEER data with the structure of CusB, we used the MMM software (2015 version) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref039">39</xref>]. The software requires an entry PDB file, and the residues where the spin-labels are attached to the protein. This method describes spin labels by a set of alternative conformations or rotamers, which can be attached without serious clashes with atoms of other residues or cofactors. The rotamer library is derived from molecular dynamic simulation with a total length of 100 ns at a temperature of 175K, which is an estimate of the glass transition of a protein sample. Here we used the two structures of apo-CusB and holo-CusB, which were previously constructed based on various DEER constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) as an input PDB files for the MMM software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref022">22</xref>]. The dashed black-line distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g003">Fig 3B</xref> denotes the distance distribution obtained from MMM. The apo-state exhibits a broad distance distribution that is consistent with the calculated model structure of CusB, whereas in the holo-state the structure is more compact and rigid, which results in a much narrower distance distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref022">22</xref>]. The orientation of the spin-labels in the two structures are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219337.s006">S6 Fig</xref>. DEER also confirmed that when one specific methionine residue among M64, M227, and M241 was mutated, structural changes in CusB protein associated with Cu(I) binding were affected. For simplicity, we used a linear composition of the apo-WT-CusB distance distribution with the holo-WT-CusB distance distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219337.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Although the effect of each mutation on conformational changes may not be a simple two-step model between the apo- and holo-states, this approach can still provide us with an overview on how much each mutation disturbs the conformation and function of the CusB protein. In the case of CusB_M64I + Cu(I), the distance distribution is very similar to the apo WT-CusB distance distribution, suggesting that Cu(I) did not affect the conformation of CusB in the presence of M64I mutation. In contrast, for holo CusB_M398I, the distribution is slightly broader than the holo WT-CusB. However, the best fit was still obtained with 100% holo WT-CusB distance distribution, indicating that M398I did not affect the conformational changes of CusB upon Cu(I) binding. For CusB_M227I and CusB_M241I, the best fit was obtained with convolutions of 50% and 90%, respectively, of the apo-WT-CusB distance distribution with the holo-WT-CusB distance distribution. This suggests that both mutations affect the conformational changes of CusB in the presence of Cu(I), while M241I has a larger effect on conformation of CusB than the M227I mutation. The DEER agrees well with the cell experiments. When M398I, which hardly affects the cell growth, was mutated, the conformational changes induced by the Cu(I) binding was almost not affected. In contrast, M64I largely affected the cell growth consistent with the DEER data that showed that CusB did not assume any conformational changes upon Cu(I) binding. This suggests that Cu(I) needs to first bind to the N-terminal domain of CusB and then to transfer to the next site. Mutations in M227 and M241 which showed partial effects on cell growth, disturb the conformational changes induced by CusB in the presence of Cu(I), but do not completely inhibit it as does the M64I mutation. The DEER data indicate that mutations of M64, M227, and M241 affect both the cell growth and conformational changes in CusB and that the conformational changes presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g001">Fig 1B</xref> are essential for the protein to function.</p>

<p>Cu(I) ions binding BCA with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:2. Cu(I)-(BCA)<sub>2</sub> show a characteristic high absorption at 562 nm. The binding affinity of proteins for Cu(I) can be calculated by monitoring the change in the absorption peak intensity of the Cu(I)-(BCA)<sub>2</sub> complex at 562 nm, which is associated with protein titration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>When the solution of the Cu(I)-(BCA)<sub>2</sub> complex was titrated with CusB mutants, the CusB mutant competed for Cu(I) with BCA, thereby decreasing the concentration of Cu(I)-(BCA)<sub>2</sub>, which lowered the absorption peak intensity at 562 nm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> show the absorption spectra recorded for the titration of Cu(I)-(BCA)<sub>2</sub> with WT-CusB and CusB_M64I, respectively. The decrease in the absorption peak at 562 nm suggests that both WT-CusB and CusB_M64I may compete for Cu(I) with BCA. However, the affinity of CusB_M64I for Cu(I) is weaker than that of WT-CusB. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g004">Fig 4C</xref> presents changes in the absorption peak at 562 nm for various CusB mutants, as affected by Cu(I) concentration; it shows that WT-CusB binds Cu(I) with the highest affinity, whereas CusB_M64I has the lowest affinity for Cu(I).</p>

<p>An increase in the K<sub>D</sub> value indicates that the Cu(I) binding to CusB is weaker. The lowest K<sub>D</sub> value was observed for WT-CusB; the highest value was for CusB_M64I; however, CusB_M241I had a slightly higher K<sub>D</sub> value than that of CusB_M227I. This result is very consistent with the DEER measurement, which showed more significant inhibition of the conformational changes in CusB associated with Cu(I) binding for CusB_M241I than for CusB_M227I.</p>

A comparison of cell images of the WT clone with those of the CusB_M64I clone at the late lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) indicates a 62 &#177; 7% increase in the dead cell count before incorporating Cu(II) into the growth medium and a 100 &#177; 1% increase for clones grown under Cu(II) stress. With CusB_M241I and CusB_M227I, there were increases of 30 &#177; 3 and 23 &#177; 4%, respectively, in the dead cell count before incorporating Cu(II) into the growth medium and increases of 90 &#177; 2% and 75 &#177; 1%, respectively, for the same clones grown under Cu(II) stress.</p>

<p>Monitoring the cell viability, as a function of time, revealed that changes in growth rates were followed by cell deaths and not merely slower cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219337.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). After 8 hr of growth in 3 &#181;M Cu(II), 60 &#177; 7% of cells containing WT-CusB remained alive and 18 &#177; 2% remained alive for CusB_M64I. The percentages of living cells after 8 hr of growth in 3 &#181;M Cu(II) were 16 &#177; 2% and 20 &#177; 1% for CusB_M241I and CusB_M227I, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The CusCBA efflux system plays an indispensable role in copper homeostasis and cell viability within <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells, and CusB controls the opening of the whole CusCBA complex. Understanding how CusB functions at the molecular level could facilitate the design of an inhibitor for the whole CusCBA efflux system. The trigger for opening the channel was shown to be the interaction between the metallochaperone CusF and the N-terminal domain of CusB (CusB_NT) associated with Cu(I) binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref025">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref044">44</xref>]. Previously, we and others studied CusB_NT and elucidated the significance of the three conserved methionine residues (M49, M64, and M66) for Cu(I) binding within CusB_NT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref027">27</xref>]. In another study on full-length CusB, we found that CusB dimer had to adopt a specific conformation in association with Cu(I) binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219337.ref022">22</xref>]. Importantly, we showed that domains 2 and 3 underwent major structural changes associated with Cu(I) binding, in agreement with the crystal structure reported; this suggests that an additional Cu(I) site exists in this region. In the present study, we initially performed cell growth experiments. Each time, we mutated a different methionine residue. All mutants affected the cell growth rate. However, four of them had a slightly larger effect on the cell growth compared to the others, and therefore we focused on these mutants. By coupling in-vitro and cell experiments, we highlighted the importance of three methionine residues: M64 (N-terminal domain), M227 (domain 3), and M241 (domain 2) for the growth rate and viability of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells, and for the proper conformational changes in CusB. Pulsed EPR spectroscopy (DEER) showed that when one of the three methionine residues was replaced, it affected the conformational changes of CusB in the presence of Cu(I). Evaluating the K<sub>D</sub> value using UV-vis spectroscopy has shown that CusB binds Cu(I) ions with diminished affinity when it lacks one of the Met residues. Live/dead fluorescence cell imaging assisted in confirming that a mutation in one of the CusB methionine residues largely affects the cell viability. Time-dependent live/dead cell fluorescence imaging confirmed that CusB mutations lead to cell death and not merely to decreased cell growth. This finding indicates that introducing mutations in CusB results in toxicity that eventually leads to cell death within 8 hr. Our experimental data clearly indicates that at least one Cu(I) binding site exists in domain 2 and 3 of CusB. However, further study is required in order to better resolve this issue. Combining cell experiments with in-vitro experiments provided us with a deeper insight into the mechanism underlying the efflux system and an enhanced understanding of why point mutations decrease cell viability.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>By combining in-vitro structural measurements with cell experiments, we obtained better understanding of the mechanism of action underlying the adapter protein within the copper efflux system in Gram-negative bacteria, at the molecular and nanoscale levels. Our experiments in both solution and cells suggest that besides the essential methionine residues reported before, there are two additional methionine residues at CusB domains 2 and 3 (M227 and M241) that are important for proper function of the CusCBA transporter. Mutating these methionine residues affects the conformational changes of CusB in the presence of Cu(I) and reduces the functionality of the CusB protein, which decreases copper resistance and increases cell toxicity in pathogenic cells.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Developing novel drugs to eliminate new pathogenic bacteria is one of the highest priority in antibiotics research. One of the best approaches is to inhibit copper transporters in prokaryotic systems which is required for many crucial biological pathways. Pathogenic systems contain a highly sophisticated copper-regulation network. Recently, it was revealed that the CusB protein part of the CusCBA periplasmic Cu(I) efflux system in Gram-negative bacteria, play an important key role in the functioning of the whole CusCBA system</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors targeted two methionine residues (M227 and M241) that are essential for the proper function of CusB of Escherrichia coli. The authors used a combination of in-vitro spectroscopic measurements and cell experiments to study the significance of each single methionine residue in CusB and its effect on cell survival. Indeed, they used pulsed EPR spectroscopy to study the conformational changes of CusB associated with Cu(I) binding.</p>
<p>The combination of the in-vitro structural measurements comprised of double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, coupled with site directed spin labeling (SDSL). Also, the DEER technique pulsed electron double resonance (PELDOR) was used to measure the dipolar interactions between two or more electron spins. The authors compared the DEER data with the structure of CusB and used multiscale modeling of macromolecular systems.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors evaluated the binding affinity of CusB proteins for Cu(I) by using the spectrophotometric competition assay with bicinchoninic acid (BCA) as a ligand. Furthermore, the authors conducted live/dead fluorescence cell imaging experiments to determine whether point mutations might lead to cell death or only to a reduction in E. coli cell growth.</p>
<p>In this excellent rationale, they showed that beside essential methionine residues reported before, there were two additional methionine residues at CusB domains 2 and 3 (M227 and M241) that are important for proper function of the CusCBA transporter. Mutating these methionine residues inhibits conformational changes in CusB in the presence of Cu(I) and results in a non-functional CusB protein, decreased copper resistance, and increased cell toxicity in pathogenic cells.</p>
<p>This manuscript is very well written and it was a pleasure reading it. The biochemical analytical work and associated single-point mutation genetics is outstanding.</p>
<p>Tow minor comments are indicated:</p>
<p>1. There are lots of scientific abbreviation like: multicopper oxidase CueO, CopA, CusCBA that should be defined for the non- biochemistry expert.</p>
<p>2. In page ,lines 71 and 72 you have written the following;</p>
<p>The inner and the outer membrane proteins are connected by a linker protein, CusB, in the periplasm, and are at a CusA: CusB: CusC oligomerization ratio of 3:6:3 [16].</p>
<p>QUERY: Do you mean that the inner and the outer membrane proteins are connected by a linker protein, CusB, in the periplasm, which is composed of a CusA: CusB: CusC oligomerization ratio of 3:6:3 [16].</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s what you mean, than my correction seems better</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The study by Meir et al. described in this manuscript focuses on the effects of Cu(I) binding to CusB, being part of the periplasmic CusCBA copper-I efflux system of (pathogenic) gram-negative bacteria. The authors combined structural investigations using EPR (DEER) spectroscopy, photometric Cu(I)-binding assays and live cell experiments to obtain insights into the functional relevance of several methionine residues in CusB.</p>
<p>The subject of this study is of high relevance for the field of antibiotics research, opening pathways to new antibiotics specifically targeting the Cus system of pathogenic bacteria that is not present in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>The concept of this study is well elaborated, the experiments appear to be performed expertly from a technical point of view, and the results obtained in this study reveal valuable insights into the function of the CusB protein, esp. its Cu(I) binding properties.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, interpretation of the data and its representation in the form of the present manuscript do not appear appropriate for publication without major revisions as detailed in the following.</p>
<p>1. Major points to address:</p>
<p>- The authors state that expression levels (Fig. S5) and secondary structure (Fig. S4, stated in l. 127/8 and l. 156) of all mutant clones are identical. Apart from the fact that this is only shown for 4 of the 10 mutants prepared, the CD spectra depicted in Fig. S4 do show clear differences between wt and the mutants. These differences are obvious and if it is stated that the secondary structure is not affected by the met mutations, this should be clearly shown by quantitative analyses of the CD spectra in terms of secondary structure content.</p>
<p>- Analysis and interpretation of the DEER data needs to be elaborated in more detail. The statement "..., whereas in the holo-state the spin labels are found in a symmetrical orientation, which results in a much narrower distance distribution" is not clear. What do you mean by "symmetrical orientation" of the labels and what does that mean for the overall structure of the protein (dimer).</p>
<p>I also do not see, that the structural changes are "inhibited" in the mutants 227, 241 and 64 to various extents, as I cannot clearly identify a simple shift in an equilibrium between two populations in the distance distributions. Especially when comparing the distance distributions for CusB_M241I, M227I and M64I with holo- and apo-CusB, it appears that the structural alterations upon Cu(I) binding are more complex for the mutants than a simple two-state equilibrium.</p>
<p>Another minor point concerning the comparison with the RLA results: It has been shown that the RLA for MTSSL calculated at 298 K performs better than the one for 175 K.</p>
<p>- Refering to the structural models shown in Fig. 6 with the positions of M227 and M241, the authors predict two Cu(I) binding sites in the CusB dimer comprised by these residues, respectively. Nevertheless, as stated in the text, these residues exhibit Calpha-Calpha distances &gt; 2 nm, making it very unlikely that e.g. the two M241 residues in the dimer (2.05 nm in the holostate) can together coordinate one Cu(I) ion. Thus I do not see any indications for such Cu binding site based on the results shown here.</p>
<p>Also, the prediction for another binding site comprised by M227 residues from interacting dimers in the CusCBA complex is not supported by any structural model or experimental data obtained with the assembled complex. The major question concerning this predicted binding site, that is if the CusB dimers could assemble in an appropriate orientation for bringing two M227 residues in close proximity, could be addressed for example with docking approaches.</p>
<p>- In the discussion section the authors state that mutation of M227 or M241 lead to "nonfunctional" CusB, what is simply not true. Both mutants still bind Cu(I) (cf. Table 1), and the affinities are only reduced ~2-fold. Thus I would describe it as reduced or impaired functionality, what is also reflected in the clear but not dramatically decreased growth rates observed in the cell experiments.</p>
<p>- English writing is poor in some parts of the manuscript, often leading to sentences that are difficult to understand (see below for the most relevant examples). I recommend to let a native speaker revise the manuscript.</p>
<p>2. Formal (textual) points to address:</p>
<p>- Fig. 1: the domain structure of CusB should be indicated (e.g. by different colors for the 4 domains) in the structure in panel B. It would also be very helpful to indicate the positions of the Met residues (esp. of the four mutants addressed in detail in this manuscript) in this figure. The same for Fig. 3C.</p>
<p>- Fig. 2: Panels A and B are "horrible". Esp. in panel A one cannot identify the single growth curves. I would suggest to show only the growth curves of the four "relevant" mutants in this figure and shift the other curves to the SI. Furthermore, in the main text only the final OD's after 14 h of growth are discussed (panel C) and not the growth kinetics. Thus, Fig. 2 could be reduced to show only panel C and all growth curves could be placed in the SI. Alternatively, the growth kinetics need to be (at least briefly) described in the text.</p>
<p>- l. 70/71: I guess you mean "...and an outer membrane protein (CusC)".</p>
<p>- l. 125: "..., we introduced a single point mutation in one of them." - not clear, please reformulate</p>
<p>- l. 136/7: " ...under Cu(II) was reduced by..., compared with wild-type (WT) CusB after 14 h..." - I guess you mean that the growth rate of the WT was reduced under Cu(II) stress compared to Cu-free growth conditions.</p>
<p>- l. 181: I do not understand what you mean with "...the distance distribution between four spin labels was consumed"!</p>
<p>- ll. 183-190: The description of the rotamer library approach implemented in MMM and used here is not well described. First, the authors did not perform multiscale modeling, they only used the RLA apprach implemented in the software. Second, MMM is not a computational approach that was used to derive the rotamer library. The RLA is only implemented in MMM.</p>
<p>- l. 248: An increased kD value does not weaken the binding, the weaker binding is reflected by the increased kD.</p>
<p>- l. 274: What is "An identical imaging comparison..." ?</p>
<p>- l. 305/6: I do not understand what "...it indicates that within 8 hr of selective CusB Met residue inhibition" means.</p>
<p>- l. 311: omit "numerically"</p>
<p>- SI, tables S1, S2, S3: Please reduce the number of decimal digits (Max. 1-2) for columns [Cu(I)-BCA2] and [Cu(I)-protein].</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: This study seeks to extend the understanding of the role of the various methionine residues present in copper efflux system (CusCBA). In addition to the important residues identified in previous studies the authors have identified two additional residues of importance for the function of the CusB protein. In particular, mutations of these residues led the authors to identifying an important inhibition of a conformational change upon Cu binding.</p>
<p>This is a very nice multi-technique study that uses a combination of cell growth studies, DEER (to probe conformational changes), and spectrophotometric assays to determine Cu(I) binding. The entire package presents a very convincing argument and strongly suggests further study as to the detailed role of the residues identified. I have some minor comments below but the manuscript is fit for publication.</p>
<p>Comments</p>
<p>Cell growth studies</p>
<p>I do not feel especially qualified to comment on the cell growth studies, however they appear to be well done and support the conclusions drawn in the paper.</p>
<p>I have one question in re: to the comment: &#8220;&#8230;slight effect caused by the minimal copper concentration naturally present&#8230;and the significance of the methionine residues&#8230;&#8221; Is it known how much copper is present in the growth medium?</p>
<p>DEER studies</p>
<p>This is an ideal use of DEER, and is well done. Some comments:</p>
<p>Line 181: &#8220;&#8230;the distance distribution was consumed&#8230;&#8221; I am not sure what this sentence is saying. Do the authors mean conserved?</p>
<p>Figure 3B caption: missing space after &#8220;&#8230;CusB+Cu(I)&#8221;. Should read &#8220;&#8230;+Cu(I) structure models.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cu(I) affinity studies by UV-Vis</p>
<p>Some concerns with the data:</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Developing novel drugs to eliminate new pathogenic bacteria is one of the highest priority in antibiotics research. One of the best approaches is to inhibit copper transporters in prokaryotic systems which is required for many crucial biological pathways. Pathogenic systems contain a highly sophisticated copper-regulation network. Recently, it was revealed that the CusB protein part of the CusCBA periplasmic Cu(I) efflux system in Gram-negative bacteria, play an important key role in the functioning of the whole CusCBA system</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors targeted two methionine residues (M227 and M241) that are essential for the proper function of CusB of Escherrichia coli. The authors used a combination of in-vitro spectroscopic measurements and cell experiments to study the significance of each single methionine residue in CusB and its effect on cell survival. Indeed, they used pulsed EPR spectroscopy to study the conformational changes of CusB associated with Cu(I) binding.</p>
<p>The combination of the in-vitro structural measurements comprised of double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, coupled with site directed spin labeling (SDSL). Also, the DEER technique pulsed electron double resonance (PELDOR) was used to measure the dipolar interactions between two or more electron spins. The authors compared the DEER data with the structure of CusB and used multiscale modeling of macromolecular systems.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors evaluated the binding affinity of CusB proteins for Cu(I) by using the spectrophotometric competition assay with bicinchoninic acid (BCA) as a ligand. Furthermore, the authors conducted live/dead fluorescence cell imaging experiments to determine whether point mutations might lead to cell death or only to a reduction in E. coli cell growth.</p>
<p>In this excellent rationale, they showed that beside essential methionine residues reported before, there were two additional methionine residues at CusB domains 2 and 3 (M227 and M241) that are important for proper function of the CusCBA transporter. Mutating these methionine residues inhibits conformational changes in CusB in the presence of Cu(I) and results in a non-functional CusB protein, decreased copper resistance, and increased cell toxicity in pathogenic cells.</p>
<p>This manuscript is very well written and it was a pleasure reading it. The biochemical analytical work and associated single-point mutation genetics is outstanding.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: thank you very much.</p>
<p>Two minor comments are indicated:</p>
<p>1. There are lots of scientific abbreviation like: multicopper oxidase CueO, CopA, CusCBA that should be defined for the non- biochemistry expert.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: Abbreviation table was added to the manuscript</p>
<p>2. In page ,lines 71 and 72 you have written the following;</p>
<p>The inner and the outer membrane proteins are connected by a linker protein, CusB, in the periplasm, and are at a CusA: CusB: CusC oligomerization ratio of 3:6:3 [16].</p>
<p>QUERY: Do you mean that the inner and the outer membrane proteins are connected by a linker protein, CusB, in the periplasm, which is composed of a CusA: CusB: CusC oligomerization ratio of 3:6:3 [16].</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s what you mean, than my correction seems better</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: thanks - we corrected the sentence according to your suggestion.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The study by Meir et al. described in this manuscript focuses on the effects of Cu(I) binding to CusB, being part of the periplasmic CusCBA copper-I efflux system of (pathogenic) gram-negative bacteria. The authors combined structural investigations using EPR (DEER) spectroscopy, photometric Cu(I)-binding assays and live cell experiments to obtain insights into the functional relevance of several methionine residues in CusB.</p>
<p>The subject of this study is of high relevance for the field of antibiotics research, opening pathways to new antibiotics specifically targeting the Cus system of pathogenic bacteria that is not present in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>The concept of this study is well elaborated, the experiments appear to be performed expertly from a technical point of view, and the results obtained in this study reveal valuable insights into the function of the CusB protein, esp. its Cu(I) binding properties.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, interpretation of the data and its representation in the form of the present manuscript do not appear appropriate for publication without major revisions as detailed in the following.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: Thank you for your comments &#8211; they are very helpful, we addressed them below based on your suggestions.</p>
<p>1. Major points to address:</p>
<p>- The authors state that expression levels (Fig. S5) and secondary structure (Fig. S4, stated in l. 127/8 and l. 156) of all mutant clones are identical. Apart from the fact that this is only shown for 4 of the 10 mutants prepared, the CD spectra depicted in Fig. S4 do show clear differences between wt and the mutants. These differences are obvious and if it is stated that the secondary structure is not affected by the met mutations, this should be clearly shown by quantitative analyses of the CD spectra in terms of secondary structure content.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: The quantitative analysis of the CD spectra was added to the SI (Figure S5). Ten mutations were prepared for the cell experiments, in vitro experiments were performed on four mutations, and therefore for the CD we used them. The CD suggests less than 3% effect on the secondary structure. We revised the conclusion in the SI, and deleted the above statement from the text.</p>
<p>- Analysis and interpretation of the DEER data needs to be elaborated in more detail. The statement "..., whereas in the holo-state the spin labels are found in a symmetrical orientation, which results in a much narrower distance distribution" is not clear. What do you mean by "symmetrical orientation" of the labels and what does that mean for the overall structure of the protein (dimer).</p>
<p>I also do not see, that the structural changes are "inhibited" in the mutants 227, 241 and 64 to various extents, as I cannot clearly identify a simple shift in an equilibrium between two populations in the distance distributions. Especially when comparing the distance distributions for CusB_M241I, M227I and M64I with holo- and apo-CusB, it appears that the structural alterations upon Cu(I) binding are more complex for the mutants than a simple two-state equilibrium.</p>
<p>Another minor point concerning the comparison with the RLA results: It has been shown that the RLA for MTSSL calculated at 298 K performs better than the one for 175 K.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: We rewrote the DEER section, Figure S2 was added to the SI, and we hope that with these changes it is more clear. The DEER section was written as follow: &#8220;To compare the DEER data with the structure of CusB, we used the MMM software (2015 version) [39]. The software requires an entry PDB file, and the residues where the spin-labels are attached to the protein. This method describes spin labels by a set of alternative conformations or rotamers, which can be attached without serious clashes with atoms of other residues or cofactors. The rotamer library is derived from molecular dynamic simulation with a total length of 100 ns at a temperature of 175K, which is an estimate of the glass transition of a protein sample. Here we used the two structures of apo-CusB and holo-CusB, which were previously constructed based on various DEER constraints (Figure 1B) as an input PDB files for the MMM software [22]. The dashed black-line distribution in Figure 3B denotes the distance distribution obtained from MMM. The apo-state exhibits a broad distance distribution that is consistent with the calculated model structure of CusB, whereas in the holo-state the structure is more compact and rigid,  which results in a much narrower distance distribution [22]. The orientation of the spin-labels in the two structures are presented in Figure S2, SI.  DEER also confirmed that when one specific methionine residue among M64, M227, and M241 was mutated, structural changes in CusB protein associated with Cu(I) binding were affected. For simplicity, we used a linear composition of the apo-WT-CusB distance distribution with the holo-WT-CusB distance distribution (see Figure S2, SI). Although the effect of each mutation on conformational changes may not be a simple two-step model between the apo- and holo-states, this approach can still provide us with an overview on how much each mutation disturbs the conformation and function of the CusB protein. In the case of CusB_M64I + Cu(I), the distance distribution is very similar to the apo WT-CusB distance distribution, suggesting that Cu(I) did not affect the conformation of CusB in the presence of M64I mutation. In contrast, for holo CusB_M398I, the distribution is slightly broader than the holo WT-CusB. However, the best fit was still obtained with 100% holo WT-CusB distance distribution, indicating that M398I did not affect the conformational changes of CusB upon Cu(I) binding. For CusB_M227I and CusB_M241I, the best fit was obtained with convolutions of 50% and 90%, respectively, of the apo-WT-CusB distance distribution with the holo-WT-CusB distance distribution. This suggests that both mutations affect the conformational changes of CusB in the presence of Cu(I), while M241I has a larger effect on conformation of CusB than the M227I mutation.&#8221;</p>
<p>We calculated the RLA both at 175K as well as 298K, there were no large differences. The 175K is a bit better fit for our data.</p>
<p>- Refering to the structural models shown in Fig. 6 with the positions of M227 and M241, the authors predict two Cu(I) binding sites in the CusB dimer comprised by these residues, respectively. Nevertheless, as stated in the text, these residues exhibit Calpha-Calpha distances &gt; 2 nm, making it very unlikely that e.g. the two M241 residues in the dimer (2.05 nm in the holostate) can together coordinate one Cu(I) ion. Thus I do not see any indications for such Cu binding site based on the results shown here.</p>
<p>Also, the prediction for another binding site comprised by M227 residues from interacting dimers in the CusCBA complex is not supported by any structural model or experimental data obtained with the assembled complex. The major question concerning this predicted binding site, that is if the CusB dimers could assemble in an appropriate orientation for bringing two M227 residues in close proximity, could be addressed for example with docking approaches.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: We agree with the reviewer that based on the results presented in this manuscript, we cannot offer the structural model presented in Figure 6, therefore we deleted this part from the manuscript. However, we do think that the results clearly support the conclusion that M227 and M241 residues are important for proper function of CusB, which is the main conclusion of this study. </p>
<p>- In the discussion section the authors state that mutation of M227 or M241 lead to "nonfunctional" CusB, what is simply not true. Both mutants still bind Cu(I) (cf. Table 1), and the affinities are only reduced ~2-fold. Thus I would describe it as reduced or impaired functionality, what is also reflected in the clear but not dramatically decreased growth rates observed in the cell experiments.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: Yes we agree, and it was corrected in the text.</p>
<p>- English writing is poor in some parts of the manuscript, often leading to sentences that are difficult to understand (see below for the most relevant examples). I recommend to let a native speaker revise the manuscript.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: A native speaker checked and revised the manuscript</p>
<p>2. Formal (textual) points to address:</p>
<p>- Fig. 1: the domain structure of CusB should be indicated (e.g. by different colors for the 4 domains) in the structure in panel B. It would also be very helpful to indicate the positions of the Met residues (esp. of the four mutants addressed in detail in this manuscript) in this figure. The same for Fig. 3C.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: As suggested, we revised Figure 1, and added the domains to Figure 3C.</p>
<p>- Fig. 2: Panels A and B are "horrible". Esp. in panel A one cannot identify the single growth curves. I would suggest to show only the growth curves of the four "relevant" mutants in this figure and shift the other curves to the SI. Furthermore, in the main text only the final OD's after 14 h of growth are discussed (panel C) and not the growth kinetics. Thus, Fig. 2 could be reduced to show only panel C and all growth curves could be placed in the SI. Alternatively, the growth kinetics need to be (at least briefly) described in the text.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: We moved Figure 2A and 2B to the SI as suggested by the referee.</p>
<p>- l. 70/71: I guess you mean "...and an outer membrane protein (CusC)".</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: Corrected.</p>
<p>- l. 125: "..., we introduced a single point mutation in one of them." - not clear, please reformulate</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: We rephrased it: &#8220;Ten Met residues exist in CusB; in order to determine which of them are essential for cell growth, each time one methionine residue was mutated to isoleucine.&#8221;</p>
<p>- l. 136/7: " ...under Cu(II) was reduced by..., compared with wild-type (WT) CusB after 14 h..." - I guess you mean that the growth rate of the WT was reduced under Cu(II) stress compared to Cu-free growth conditions.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: yes, we corrected it. </p>
<p>- l. 181: I do not understand what you mean with "...the distance distribution between four spin labels was consumed"!</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: The DEER section was rewritten &#8211; see the answer above.</p>
<p>- ll. 183-190: The description of the rotamer library approach implemented in MMM and used here is not well described. First, the authors did not perform multiscale modeling, they only used the RLA apprach implemented in the software. Second, MMM is not a computational approach that was used to derive the rotamer library. The RLA is only implemented in MMM.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: The DEER section was rewritten &#8211; see the answer above.</p>
<p>- l. 248: An increased kD value does not weaken the binding, the weaker binding is reflected by the increased kD.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: Corrected</p>
<p>- l. 274: What is "An identical imaging comparison..." ?</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: thanks - we deleted it (it was out of context).</p>
<p>- l. 305/6: I do not understand what "...it indicates that within 8 hr of selective CusB Met residue inhibition" means.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: We rephrased it: &#8220;This finding indicates that introducing mutations in CusB results in toxicity that eventually leads to cell death within 8 hr.&#8221;</p>
<p>- l. 311: omit "numerically"</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s replay: Corrected.</p>
<p>- SI, tables S1, S2, S3: Please reduce the number of decimal digits (Max. 1-2) for columns [Cu(I)-BCA2] and [Cu(I)-protein].</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: Was revised as suggested by the referee.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: This study seeks to extend the understanding of the role of the various methionine residues present in copper efflux system (CusCBA). In addition to the important residues identified in previous studies the authors have identified two additional residues of importance for the function of the CusB protein. In particular, mutations of these residues led the authors to identifying an important inhibition of a conformational change upon Cu binding.</p>
<p>This is a very nice multi-technique study that uses a combination of cell growth studies, DEER (to probe conformational changes), and spectrophotometric assays to determine Cu(I) binding. The entire package presents a very convincing argument and strongly suggests further study as to the detailed role of the residues identified. I have some minor comments below but the manuscript is fit for publication.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Comments</p>
<p>Cell growth studies</p>
<p>I do not feel especially qualified to comment on the cell growth studies, however they appear to be well done and support the conclusions drawn in the paper.</p>
<p>I have one question in re: to the comment: &#8220;&#8230;slight effect caused by the minimal copper concentration naturally present&#8230;and the significance of the methionine residues&#8230;&#8221; Is it known how much copper is present in the growth medium?</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: Thanks - we added it to the text &#8211; it is 0.5 &#65533;M.</p>
<p>DEER studies</p>
<p>This is an ideal use of DEER, and is well done. Some comments:</p>
<p>Line 181: &#8220;&#8230;the distance distribution was consumed&#8230;&#8221; I am not sure what this sentence is saying. Do the authors mean conserved?</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: We rephrased it in the text.</p>
<p>Figure 3B caption: missing space after &#8220;&#8230;CusB+Cu(I)&#8221;. Should read &#8220;&#8230;+Cu(I) structure models.&#8221;</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: thanks &#8211; we corrected it.</p>
<p>Cu(I) affinity studies by UV-Vis</p>
<p>Some concerns with the data:</p>
<p>Figure 4A: While the peak height is decreasing there appears to be a baseline shift as well. Figure 4B shows clean isobestic points, but these appear absent in 4A. Could the authors comment about this? The derived Kd values appear reasonable, however.</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: The spectra were baselined according to the absorption value at 800 nm, which is zero &#8211; we added it to the SI.</p>
<p>Cell viability studies</p>
<p>Similar to above, I am not qualified to comment in a significant way, but these appear to be well done and support the overall conclusions.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to merge these studies with the cell growth studies? May shorten the manuscript in a useful way. They seem highly related (though this very well may just be my lack of experience with these types of microbiological studies).</p>
<p>Author&#8217;s reply: The cell viability tests are complimentary to the cell growth experiments since they show that point mutations do not only affect cell growth but also are toxic to the cell. Therefore, we decided to leave this section to the end, since this is very important conclusion towards development of new antibiotics.</p>
