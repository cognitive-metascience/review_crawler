<abstract>
<p>Atonal homolog 8 (Atoh8) is a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein family, which is expressed in the cartilaginous elements of endochondral bones. To analyze its function during chondrogenesis we deleted Atoh8 in mice using a chondrocyte- (<italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Col2a1-Cre</italic>) and a germline- (<italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup>) specific Cre allele. In both strains, Atoh8 deletion leads to a reduced skeletal size of the axial and appendicular bones, but the stages of phenotypic manifestations differ. While we observed obviously shortened bones in <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Col2a1-Cre</italic> mice only postnatally, the bones of <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup> mice are characterized by a reduced bone length already at prenatal stages. Detailed histological and molecular investigations revealed reduced zones of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes. In addition, Atoh8 deletion identified Atoh8 as a positive regulator of chondrocyte proliferation. As increased Atoh8 expression is found in the region of prehypertrophic chondrocytes where the expression of Ihh, a main regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, is induced, we investigated a potential interaction of Atoh8 function and Ihh signaling. By activating Ihh signaling with Purmorphamine we demonstrate that Atoh8 regulates chondrocyte proliferation in parallel or downstream of Ihh signaling while it acts on the onset of hypertrophy upstream of Ihh likely by modulating Ihh expression levels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During endochondral ossification, bones are formed by a multistep process, which includes the formation of a cartilage template of the later skeletal element and its subsequent replacement by bone. The cartilage anlagen originate in mesenchymal cells, which condense and differentiate into chondrocytes. These chondrocytes proliferate and express the extracellular matrix protein Collagen type 2 (Col2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref001">1</xref>]. Two subtypes of proliferating chondrocytes can be distinguished: round, slow proliferating cells at the end of the cartilage elements (round/resting chondrocytes) and flat, highly proliferating cells organized in columns towards the hypertrophic region (columnar chondrocytes). When the cartilage anlagen reach a critical size, proliferating chondrocytes in their center exit the cell cycle and differentiate into Indian hedgehog (Ihh) producing, prehypertrophic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref003">3</xref>] and, subsequently, Collagen type 10 (Col10) expressing, hypertrophic chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref004">4</xref>]. Eventually, blood vessels invade the zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes and the hypertrophic cells are replaced by bone and bone marrow. Postnatally, secondary ossification centers (SOC) are formed at the ends of the endochondral long bones. Between the two regions of ossification, parts of the embryonic cartilage, the so-called growth plates, remain to organize longitudinal growth after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref005">5</xref>]. As longitudinal bone growth depends on the balance between chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophic differentiation, both processes are tightly regulated. Although many regulators have been identified, clarifying the detailed molecular mechanisms is still in progress.</p>
<p>Atonal homolog 8 (Atoh8, also known as Math6 in mouse) is a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref006">6</xref>]. The helix-loop-helix region of these proteins mediates the interaction with other bHLH proteins, while their basic region binds to a specific DNA sequence, the E-box element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>In contrast to other atonal-related proteins, which show a tissue restricted pattern of expression, Atoh8 is broadly expressed in many organs including the brain, kidney and skeletal muscles and regulates proliferation and differentiation of distinct cell types. For instance, overexpression of Atoh8 in retinal explant cultures promotes the differentiation of neuronal progenitors towards the neuronal versus the glial cell lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref006">6</xref>]. Consistent with this, Atoh8 is necessary for the differentiation of the hypaxial muscles of the trunk in chicken embryos, which underpins its importance for the proliferation-to-differentiation transition in embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref008">8</xref>]. In mice, loss of Atoh8 expression leads to podocyte dedifferentiation during kidney development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref009">9</xref>]. In addition, Atoh8 has been described as an activator of proliferation during muscle regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref010">10</xref>] and in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In the developing skeleton, Atoh8 has been shown to be expressed in avian growth plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref012">12</xref>] and in mouse limb buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref014">14</xref>], but its molecular role has not been investigated.</p>
<p>In this study, we show that Atoh8 deficiency results in reduced zones of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes and, consequently, in a decreased length of endochondral bones. In addition, we observed a reduced proliferation rate due to Atoh8 depletion suggesting Atoh8 positively regulates chondrocyte proliferation. Moreover, the altered domain of proliferating chondrocytes indicates an additional function as a regulator of hypertrophy. In limb explant cultures, we found Atoh8 to regulate the onset of chondrocyte differentiation upstream of Ihh, while it acts independent or downstream of Ihh in the regulation of proliferation.</p>

<p>Probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> (effect direction probabilities) that Atoh8 deletion is associated with a negative or positive effect, respectively, on the measured quantities were estimated by Bayesian inference with Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Specifically, if the measured quantities were continuous and positive (distances, or, in qPCR measurements, relative expressions), we modeled the measurements as generated by a linear model linked to the measurement scale by a logarithm, and with a normal noise distribution; if the measured quantities were counts (BrdU experiments), measurements were considered as generated by a linear model linked by a logit-function to a binomial probability parameter, and finally a binomial distribution producing the observed data. In all linear parts of the GLMs, effects coming from batches, litters, or animals were treated as separate intercepts in the linear model. Priors for all fitted parameters were chosen much broader than the distribution of the actual data so that the posteriors are mainly determined by the data. Models were fitted with the default sampler of the Stan software, version 2.17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref031">31</xref>], typically with three Markov chains, each of several thousand iterations. Convergence of Markov chains was monitored with the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic parameter &#530;, which was lower than 1.02 in all cases, and the effective sample size, typically in the hundreds or thousands. Posterior predictive checks were carried out to test consistency of all fitted models with the data of the respective experiments. Finally, <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> values were computed by sampling from the fitted posterior the strength of the effect of interest (e.g. the effect of the genotype) on the measured quantity. All <italic>p</italic><sub>-</sub> and <italic>p</italic><sub>+</sub> values are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218230.s005">S1 Table</xref>. The interpretation of effect direction probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> is simple: e.g. if we are interested in the effect of Atoh8 on Col2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), the value <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> = 0.984 at day 7 means that a negative effect of the Atoh8-knockout on Col2 expression has a probability of 0.984; accordingly, the probability of a positive effect is <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> 1-<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> = 0.016. All effect direction probabilities are given to 3 digits. Effect direction probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> &#8805; 0.950 and <italic>p</italic><sub>+</sub> &#8804; 0.050 or vice versa are regarded to be significant. To analyze if the effects of the Purmorphamine treatment varied between the genotypes, two GLMs were developed.

<title>Atoh8 is expressed in proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes</title>
<p>To receive first insight into the role of Atoh8 in skeletal development, we investigated its detailed expression pattern in mouse skeletal tissues. Whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of E12.5 embryos confirmed the expression in early limb buds, particularly in the developing cartilage anlagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g001">Fig 1A&#8211;1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref014">14</xref>]. In order to determine the specific expression of Atoh8 in chondrocytes, we compared its expression to that of Col2 and Col10, markers of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes, respectively. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization on parallel sections of E14.5 wild-type limbs revealed that Atoh8 is expressed in both, proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>) with an increased level of expression in prehypertrophic chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, arrows). Furthermore, we analyzed Atoh8 expression during the differentiation of primary chondrocytes in micromass cultures by qRT-PCR. High Atoh8 expression was detected at day 7 of culture, while it continued to be expressed at lower levels until at least day 28 when hypertrophic differentiation has taken place as demonstrated by the decrease in Col2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to Atoh8, no other <italic>Atoh</italic> gene is expressed in chondrocytes, as no noteworthy mRNA expression is detectable via qRT-PCR in control or Atoh8-deficient developing skeletal elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218230.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Chondrocyte-specific deletion of Atoh8 results in reduced bone length due to disturbed chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation at postnatal stages</title>
<p>In order to determine the role of Atoh8 during endochondral ossification we analyzed mice carrying a chondrocyte-specific deletion of Atoh8. For this purpose, we used a conditional allele of Atoh8, in which Exon1 is flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218230.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref017">17</xref>], and deleted Exon1 of <italic>Atoh8</italic> specifically in chondrocytes using a Col2a1-Cre driver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref015">15</xref>]. Both, hetero- and homozygous mutants were born in Mendelian ratios and were viable and fertile. Besides a slightly reduced body size, <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Col2a1-Cre</italic> mutants did not show any obvious phenotypes.</p>
<p>To investigate the skeletal phenotype of the mutants in detail, we analyzed Safranin-Weigert stained forelimb sections of embryonic and juvenile mice and Alcian blue/Alizarin red stained adult skeletons. We could not detect distinct differences between mutant and control mice at prenatal stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218230.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). However, from early postnatal stages (P7 and P14) until adulthood (6 month) the skeletal size was reduced in <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Col2a1-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

<p>To determine the molecular basis for the reduced bone length in <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Col2a1-Cre</italic> mice, we analyzed the size of the cartilage region including proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes on sections of P7 mice after Safranin-Weigert staining.

To investigate which step of the differentiation program is affected, we analyzed the expression of Col2 and Col10, markers for proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes, respectively, on parallel sections of P7 forelimbs by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. In order to determine if the onset of hypertrophy is disturbed, we measured the distance of the Col10 expression zone to the joint as well as the length of the Col2 expression zone, which demarcate the region of proliferating chondrocytes. Both zones were decreased in P7 <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Col2a1-Cre</italic> mutants (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> = 0.009 and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> = 0.025) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g003">Fig 3B&#8211;3D</xref>) pointing to a premature onset of hypertrophic differentiation.

<p>To investigate if Atoh8 also affects the differentiation of chondrocytes prenatally, we analyzed the regions of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes after <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization with <italic>Col2</italic>, <italic>Ihh</italic> and <italic>Col10</italic> antisense probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) in <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup> mice at E16.5. Measuring the size of the Col2 expression domain (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> = 0.016) and the distance of the Col10 (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> &lt; 0.001) and Ihh (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> = 0.020) expression domains to the joint, we found a reduced region of proliferating chondrocytes at E16.5, while the region of hypertrophy demarcated by the Col10 expression domain was also reduced at this stage but not as clearly (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> = 0.062) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Morphological analysis of Safranin-Weigert stained sections of E14.5 control and <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup> forelimbs revealed a reduced size of the skeletal elements and a reduced region of proliferating chondrocytes already at this early time. In addition, the hypertrophic region is significantly shorter in mutant radii (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). To test if chondrocyte proliferation is also affected prenatally, we labeled proliferating cells of E14.5 mice with BrdU. We found that compared to control littermates the proliferation rate of columnar chondrocyte of <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup> mice was reduced by 2.4% (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). As the initiation of hypertrophic differentiation requires a critical size of the skeletal element, the observed reduced hypertrophic region is likely a consequence of the reduced proliferation rate. In accordance, Alcian blue staining of micromass cultures revealed a reduced differentiation capacity of <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup> chondrocytes under differentiation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Since Col2 expression is generally decreased in Atoh8-deficient micromass cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), the reduced formation of cartilage nodules seems also be a consequence of decreased chondrocyte proliferation.</p>
<p>To investigate if the more severe phenotype in <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup> mice is based on defects in mesenchymal condensation, we analyzed cartilage anlagen of E12.5 limb buds, but could not detect differences between mutant and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g005">Fig 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, ubiquitous deletion of Atoh8 results in a reduced proliferation rate and consequently a delayed initiation of hypertrophic differentiation at early stages. At later stages the proliferation rate remains reduced, while the switch from proliferation to hypertrophy is accelerated leading to reduced regions of proliferating chondrocytes. Since the condensation of mesenchymal cells is not obviously affected, the increased severity of the phenotype compared to that of <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Col2a1-Cre</italic> mice is likely due to a temporal delay in Atoh8 inactivation by the Col2a1 driven recombination.</p>

<title>Calcineurin does not regulate nuclear localization of Atoh8 in chondrocytes</title>
<p>The calcium- and calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase Calcineurin has been identified as an interaction partner of Atoh8 regulating its nuclear localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref030">30</xref>]. The authors showed that in HEK293 cells Calcineurin inhibition by Cyclosporine A (CsA) prevents the translocation of Atoh8 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref030">30</xref>]. Since Calcineurin is known to regulate chondrogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref033">33</xref>], we asked if Calcineurin also controls the nuclear localization of Atoh8 in chondrocytes. For this purpose, we overexpressed an Atoh8-ECFP fusion protein in the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref029">29</xref>] and treated the cells with different concentrations of CsA. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that Atoh8-ECFP is primarily located in the nucleus in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Interestingly, while treatment with CsA clearly reduced nodule formation in micromass cultures as published previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref034">34</xref>], we could not detect an increased cytoplasmic localization of Atoh8 due to Calcineurin inhibition in ATDC5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In conclusion, our results indicate that in contrast to HEK293 cells the cellular localization of Atoh8 is not regulated by Calcineurin in chondrocytes.</p>

<title>Atoh8 regulates onset of hypertrophic differentiation upstream and chondrocyte proliferation independent or downstream of Ihh signaling</title>
<p>Since Atoh8 shows an increased expression in prehypertrophic chondrocytes where the expression of Ihh is initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) and both, the region of proliferating chondrocytes and the proliferation rate, are regulated by Ihh signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref003">3</xref>], we analyzed a potential interaction of Atoh8 and Ihh signaling. To activate Ihh signaling, we treated limb explant cultures of E16.5 control and <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup> mice with the Smoothened agonist Purmorphamine. We used <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization with a <italic>Col2</italic> antisense probe to identify the domain of proliferating chondrocytes, and BrdU incorporation to determine the proliferation rate. As expected, the size of the Col2 expression domain was significantly increased by Purmorphamine treatment in control mice (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the region of proliferating chondrocytes was significantly enlarged in Purmorphamine-treated <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup> limb explants (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). In contrast, the effect of the Purmorphamine treatment on chondrocyte proliferation was significantly reduced in <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup> compared to control limb explants. While the activation of Ihh signaling caused an upregulation of the proliferation rate by 1.1% in round (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> &lt; 0.001) and by 3.2% in columnar (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> &lt; 0.001) chondrocytes of control embryos, it did not or only slightly increase the proliferation rate of round (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> = 0.397) and columnar chondrocytes (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>-</italic></sub> = 0.010) in <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup> limb explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). These results indicate that Atoh8 acts independent or downstream of Ihh signaling in determining the rate of chondrocyte proliferation. In contrast, the size of the domain of proliferating chondrocytes seems to be regulated by Ihh downstream of Atoh8. This was supported by qRT-PCR analyses of E14.5 and E16.5 forelimb skeletal elements revealing a significantly reduced Ihh expression in <italic>Atoh8</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;Prx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>female</italic></sup> mutants at both stages (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> = 0.014 and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>+</italic></sub> = 0.008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218230.g007">Fig 7E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Members of the <italic>Atonal</italic> gene family, e.g. <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Atoh7</italic>, have been associated with the development of sensory neurons and are typically classified as proneuronal genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref035">35</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref037">37</xref>]. Here we have investigated the role of Atoh8, a less well characterized member of the protein family, which is widely expressed in the developing embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>The general role of Atoh8 during embryonic development has been controversially discussed, since the phenotypic spectrum of mouse mutants reaches from early embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref039">39</xref>] to no severe phenotypical alterations in an independently derived loss of function mouse line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref040">40</xref>]. A mild phenotype has also been described after pancreas-specific inactivation of a conditional Atoh8 allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref041">41</xref>]. In this study, we have used an independently generated conditional Atoh8 allele to induce a chondrocyte-specific and a ubiquitous inactivation of Atoh8 in mice. Both mutants show a reduced skeletal size, but are viable and survive until adulthood. Since no other <italic>Atoh</italic> gene is expressed in control or Atoh8-deficient developing skeletal elements, it can be excluded that the bone phenotype of Atoh8-deficient mice is diminished due to a functional redundancy or compensation by other Atoh proteins. This strongly supports a role of Atoh8 in fine tuning developmental processes rather than being required for survival.</p>
<p>Detailed analysis revealed a decreased chondrocyte proliferation rate, which is likely responsible for the decreased bone length. Furthermore, both mutant lines show reduced regions of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes indicating an additional role of Atoh8 in controlling the differentiation process. To exclude that the reduced skeletal size is due to defects in the condensation we analyzed mice at E12.5, but could not detect any differences in skeletal size. Consistent with this, deleting Atoh8 under the Col2-promoter, which is active after the chondrocyte fate is established, also reduces the proliferation rate and accelerates hypertrophic differentiation strongly indicating a direct role of Atoh8 in both processes.</p>
<p>Corresponding to our results, Atoh8 has been identified as a regulator of proliferation and differentiation in other tissues. Nevertheless, its function seems to be quite variable depending on the tissue type. For instance, in endothelial cells and podocytes Atoh8 has been identified as a negative regulator of proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref042">42</xref>] while in chondrocytes (this study), in regenerating mouse myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref010">10</xref>] and in colorectal cancer Atoh8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref011">11</xref>] seems to activate the proliferation rate. Different sets of interacting factors are thus likely to determine the cell type specific function of Atoh8 as a regulator of proliferation.</p>
<p>Although little is known about the proteins that interact with Atoh8, the serine/threonine protein phosphatase Calcineurin has recently been shown to regulate its nuclear localization in HEK293 cells. While in untreated cells Atoh8 was mainly located in the nucleus, inhibition of Calcineurin by CsA led to the retention of Atoh8 in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref030">30</xref>]. Interestingly, Calcineurin has also been identified as a regulator of chondrocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref033">33</xref>]. In chondrocytes Calcineurin controls the nuclear localization of Nfat transcription factors and consequently the expression of chondrocyte-specific regulators including Sox9, Bmp2, Fgf18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref044">44</xref>] and a large number of extracellular matrix components like Acan, Col2a1, Col9a1, Col11a1 and Col10a1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref046">46</xref>]. To test if Calcineurin regulates the cellular localization of Atoh8 in chondrocytes, we inhibited its function by CsA treatment in the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5, but could not detect any indication of an increased cytoplasmic Atoh8 localization. The dependency of nuclear Atoh8 localization on Calcineurin activity seems thus be specific for other cell types.</p>
<p>To integrate Atoh8 into the regulatory network of chondrocytes, we next investigated a potential interaction with Ihh signaling, which regulates the proliferation rate and the pool of proliferating chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref047">47</xref>]. Ihh is expressed in prehypertrophic chondrocytes and its expression domain overlaps with the region of increased Atho8 expression at the border between proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes. While chondrocyte proliferation is directly regulated by Ihh secreted from prehypertrophic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref049">49</xref>], the pool of proliferating chondrocytes is regulated indirectly by the Ihh-dependent expression of parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) in round chondrocytes. PTHrP in turn acts back on proliferating chondrocytes, where it prevents the onset of hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref050">50</xref>]. Interestingly, the expression of Ihh detected by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and qRT-PCR and, subsequently, the region of proliferating chondrocytes is reduced in Atoh8 mutants indicating that the Ihh/PthrP system acts downstream of Atoh8 on the onset of differentiation. This is supported by limb explant cultures treated with the hedgehog agonist Purmorphamine, which rescued the reduced region of proliferating cells in Atoh8-deficient explants. In contrast, activation of Ihh signaling by Purmorphamine did not fully rescue the proliferation rate in limb explant cultures of Atoh8-deficient mice strongly supporting an Ihh independent role of Atoh8 in regulating chondrocyte proliferation. If Atoh8 really acts in parallel or alternatively downstream of Ihh has to be investigated in future studies.</p>
<p>Similar to Atoh8, Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) and Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling have been shown to regulate chondrocyte proliferation independent of Ihh, whereas they modulate the onset of hypertrophy by affecting Ihh expression. While Bmp signaling induces proliferation and Ihh expression, Fgf signals inhibit both processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref052">52</xref>]. Atoh8 might thus act downstream of either signaling system or act on proliferation and differentiation as an independent regulator downstream of yet not identified mechanisms.</p>
<p>With respect to a potential interaction of Ihh signaling and Atoh8 function it is interesting to note that E-box elements, the typical target sequence of bHLH proteins, have been identified as unusual targets of Gli transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref053">53</xref>], the main mediators of Ihh signaling. Accordingly, Atoh8 and Gli might interact at these elements to regulate target gene expression. In preliminary co-immunoprecipitation experiments we could, however, not detect an interaction of Atoh8 and Gli3 (unpublished). Nevertheless, the proteins might interact in larger complexes or competitively bind to these target sequences. Alternatively, Atoh1 has been reported to regulate the transcription Cep131 and thereby influences the maintenance of the primary cilium, an essential organelle for Ihh signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218230.ref054">54</xref>]. Aoth8 might have a similar function and regulate Ihh/Gli3 via modification of cilia structure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified Atoh8 as a regulator of endochondral ossification, which increases the pool of proliferating chondrocytes by activating the rate of chondrocyte proliferation and inhibiting the onset of hypertrophic differentiation. Our data further demonstrate that Atoh8 acts upstream and in parallel or downstream of Ihh in regulating the onset of hypertrophy and the proliferation rate, respectively. Atoh8 thus represents a new factor controlling the tight balance between proliferation, cell cycle exit and hypertrophy, a critical step to coordinate bone growth.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: Atoh8 is a broadly expressed transcription factor affecting differentiation in many organs. Its expression in avian growth plate and mouse limb buds prompted the present study of any role in limb development.</p>
<p>The investigators have knocked out Atoh8 using both Prx-Cre for germline and Col2a1-Cre for chondrocytes. The stages of phenotype development were different for the two. Zones of proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes were reduced for both, but the chondrocyte-specific knockouts had shortened bones postnatally whereas the Prx-Cre mice did so already at birth. Evidence was presented of interaction of Atoh8 with IHH signalling and expression levels.</p>
<p>1. The paper is descriptive only , revealing a contributory role for Atoh8 in limb endochondral bone formation but no mechanistic insights. In its technical aspects the work has been carried out to a high standard.</p>
<p>2. The insertion of figure legends in the text is unusual. Maybe it is a policy of the journal? It is a distraction, interrupts the flow of description of Results.</p>
<p>3. Figure 1 needs a better description. Its details and interpretation would not necessarily be obvious to readers of the journal. The zones of limb buds need to be specified clearly in the figure. It is stated that Atoh8 is expressed in the proliferating and hypertrophic zones but especially in prehypertrophic, but it is not so clear in 1C that Atoh8 is expressed in the hypertrophic zone (Col X). Another interpretation is that Atoh8 is not expressed in hypertrophic but appears to be so in prehypertrophic.</p>
<p>4. Fig 1D and E. What do the micromass culture data mean, apart from showing the knockdown of Atoh8?</p>
<p>5. Fig 4C and P 13 lines 366 -373. This explanation of Fig 4C is difficult to understand, especially lines 369-371. The authors might explain carefully just exactly how these measurements were made.</p>
<p>6. Fig 4C. It is impossible to discern any detail in 4C, to the extent that there seems little point in including it iof better images are not available. . This is particularly so in view of the extremely small . although statistically significant, difference between columnar cells of control and Atoh-deficient (Fig 5D).</p>
<p>7. Fig 6 and Discussion, lines 501-510. The negative outcome of this experiment is not conclusive. Atoh8 is located primarily in the nucleus and cannot be detected in cytoplasm with Csa treatment. Excluding the possibility of Csa outside the nucleus would require more throrough investigation, rather than concluding as has been done in Discussion lines 501 et seq.</p>
<p>8. Fig 7 . The quantitative data in Fig 7 are unconvincing, and in 7C the same comment is made as for Fig 4C (above) &#8211; it is impossible to discern any detail in 7C. Furthermore the quantitative data is so weak that it is difficult to accept the conclusions that Atoh 8 acts upstream andin parallel or downstream of Ihh in regulating the onset of hypertrophy and proliferation rate, respectively ( Discussion lines 547-550). Indeed the linkage between Ihh and PTHrP is so strong physiologically that any attempt to reach conclusions about Atoh8 - Ihh relationship in isolation is beset with difficulty.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The aim of this study is to uncover the role of atonal homolog 8 (Atoh8) transcription factor in endochondral skeletal growth. The authors first studied expression of Atoh8 in developing limbs by whole mount ISH and conventional ISH on tissue sections, and the qPCR analysis of RNA prepared from micromass cultures of control and Atoh8 CKO. The authors then carried out histological and morphometric analyses of various parameters of control (Cre negative litter mates) and conditional Atoh8 deficient mutant samples (either Col2a1Cre, Atoh8 floxed or Prx1-Cre, Atoh8floxed mice). Expression analysis revealed that Atoh8 was expressed in cartilage in developing skeleton. In addition, ablation of the gene resulted in marked reduction in collagen 2 expression at least in cultured chondrocytes. In contrast, histological and various morphometric analyses of the mutant mice showed very modest differences compared to those in control mice. Though the authors claim the possible role of Atoh8 in regulation of skeletal growth and interaction with Ihh signaling, the reviewer thinks that the study is inconclusive due to a small size of sample number and insufficient information on the mouse strains. They should also consider functional redundancy among other family members and more carefully interpret the results. Otherwise, their conclusion and discussion potentially mislead the readers.</p>
<p>The culturs prepared from E12.5 limb buds contain various cell populations. The results from this culture system should not be interpreted as the phenotype of chondrocytes.</p>
<p>To identify and establish very modest differences in size of skeleton and histomorphometric parameter of growth-plate, the authors need to have appropriate control and analyze enough number of specimens. In this study, the authors always used Cre negative littermates as control, but the strains of the parent mice are not given. If the compound mice generated in this study came from more than 2 strains, they need to consider impact of genetic drift on skeletal growth difference. Col2Cre could be an another control mouse. The sample size for analysis of skeleton length is 3-4, which may not be enough to conclude the growth retardation in the mutant mice. It is not provided how many biological different samples were used for histological analysis although the sample size ranges 10-12?. It should be provided how they define the anatomical landmark to orient the limbs and to secure the longest or same tissue level for measurement of various histological parameters.</p>
<p>By searching &#8220;GenePaint&#8221; database, the reviewer found other members of Atoh families are also expressed in developing skeleton. Are there functional redundancy among other family members? Have you checked expression of other Atoh transcription factors? These points are required to reach conclusion on the exclusive role of Atoh 8 in endochondral ossification.</p>

<p>Response to reviewer #1:</p>
<p>1. The paper is descriptive only, revealing a contributory role for Atoh8 in limb endochondral bone formation but no mechanistic insights. In its technical aspects the work has been carried out to a high standard.</p>
<p>In our publication, we initially describe the bone phenotype of mice with a chondrocyte-specific or a ubiquitous Atoh8 deletion and we show that Atoh8 regulates endochondral bone growth by activating chondrocyte proliferation and inhibiting chondrocyte differentiation. Additionally, functional data from in vivo and in vitro experiments indicates that Atoh8 regulates Ihh expression and in this way modulates the onset of differentiation, while it regulates chondrocyte proliferation either downstream or independent of Ihh. Although the data includes a morphological analysis, it clearly reveals first mechanistic insights into the interaction of Ihh and the transcription factor Atoh8.</p>
<p>2. The insertion of figure legends in the text is unusual. Maybe it is a policy of the journal? It is a distraction, interrupts the flow of description of Results.</p>
<p>The insertion of figure legends in the text corresponds to the guidelines of PLOS ONE.</p>
<p>3. Figure 1 needs a better description. Its details and interpretation would not necessarily be obvious to readers of the journal. The zones of limb buds need to be specified clearly in the figure. It is stated that Atoh8 is expressed in the proliferating and hypertrophic zones but especially in prehypertrophic, but it is not so clear in 1C that Atoh8 is expressed in the hypertrophic zone (Col X). Another interpretation is that Atoh8 is not expressed in hypertrophic but appears to be so in prehypertrophic.</p>
<p>For a better visualization of the data summarized in Figure 1, we included a whole-mount in situ hybridization using a Col2 probe (1C, revised version) to demarcate the cartilage templates in the limb buds. Moreover, we added a schematic model showing the zones of proliferating, prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes as well as the Col2 and Col10 expression domains (1E, revised version). Atoh8 can be detected in all three chondrocyte populations with stronger expression in prehypertrophic chondrocytes. The hybridization signal is clearly visible in the high-resolution images of the manuscript (tiff file Fig. 1C in the first version or Fig. 1D in the revised version). </p>
<p>4. Fig 1D and E. What do the micromass culture data mean, apart from showing the knockdown of Atoh8?</p>
<p>As the reviewer states correctly, the verification of the Atoh8 knockdown is one important reason for showing the qPCR data obtained from micromass cultures (Figure 1D and E in the first version or Fig. 1F and G in the revised version). In addition, these data show that Atoh8 expression is maintained during the differentiation process in vitro. Although the expression is very low at d14, it increases again at later stages. This is in line with the results of the Atoh8 in situ hybridization revealing Atoh8 expression in proliferating, prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes and with the observation that Atoh8 regulates not only the onset, but also the process of hypertrophic differentiation. Furthermore, the decreased Col2 expression in Atoh8-deficient micromass cultures indicates that the reduced nodule formation is at least partly based on the decreased proliferation of Atoh8-deficient chondrocytes as mentioned on p. 15 lines 385-387 (first version).</p>
<p>5. Fig 4C and P 13 lines 366 -373. This explanation of Fig 4C is difficult to understand, especially lines 369-371. The authors might explain carefully just exactly how these measurements were made.</p>
<p>For a better representation of our data, we added a schematic representation of the analyzed bone showing the zones of proliferating, prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes and the Col2, Ihh and Col10 expression domains in Figure 4 (4D, revised version). We also included a detailed description of how we performed the measurements in the materials and methods section. </p>
<p>6. Fig 4C. It is impossible to discern any detail in 4C, to the extent that there seems little point in including it if better images are not available. This is particularly so in view of the extremely small. Although statistically significant, difference between columnar cells of control and Atoh-deficient (Fig 5D).</p>
<p>We agree that it is difficult to discern details in Fig. 5C in the PDF file generated upon submission. However, in the original high-resolution image submitted (tiff file) the labeled cells are clearly visible. As the reviewer states correctly, the differences between mutant and control mice are only small at this developmental stage (around 2.5 %). Nevertheless, a slight, but continuously reduced proliferation rate will ultimately lead to a reduced skeletal size. </p>
<p>7. Fig 6 and Discussion, lines 501-510. The negative outcome of this experiment is not conclusive. Atoh8 is located primarily in the nucleus and cannot be detected in cytoplasm with Csa treatment. Excluding the possibility of Csa outside the nucleus would require more throrough investigation, rather than concluding as has been done in Discussion lines 501 et seq.</p>
<p>It has been shown before that the nuclear Atoh8 translocates to the cytoplasm upon CsA treatment in HEK cells (Chen et al., 2016). In contrast, the results presented here demonstrate that under the same experimental conditions (the same CsA and the same Atoh8-Flag expression construct as used in Chen et al., 2016) the nuclear localization of Atoh8 is not altered by CsA treatment in ATDC5 cells indicating a cell type specific regulation of Atoh8 by Calcineurin. In fact, the potential regulation of Atoh8 by CsA and the corresponding connection to NFAT was one of the reasons we decided to investigate Atoh8 function in chondrocytes. As the reviewer states the result was negative concerning the localization dependency of Atoh8 on Calcineurin. Nevertheless, we thought it is important to publish the cell type specific regulation of Atoh8 localization, while the localization and activity of Calcineurin was not the scope of this study. </p>
<p>8. Fig 7. The quantitative data in Fig 7 are unconvincing, and in 7C the same comment is made as for Fig 4C (above) &#8211; it is impossible to discern any detail in 7C. Furthermore the quantitative data is so weak that it is difficult to accept the conclusions that Atoh 8 acts upstream and in parallel or downstream of Ihh in regulating the onset of hypertrophy and proliferation rate, respectively (Discussion lines 547-550). Indeed the linkage between Ihh and PTHrP is so strong physiologically that any attempt to reach conclusions about Atoh8 - Ihh relationship in isolation is beset with difficulty.</p>
<p>As discussed for figure 5C, the low quality of Fig. 7C is based on the conversion of a high-resolution tiff file visualizing details to a PDF file. </p>
<p>We fully agree that the interaction of Ihh and Pthrp is complex. While Ihh regulates chondrocyte proliferation independent of Pthrp, the onset of hypertrophic differentiation/pool of proliferating chondrocytes is regulated by the upregulation of Pthrp. Importantly, the expression of Pthrp is strongly dependent on Ihh and reduced Ihh signaling or activation by Purmorphamine treatment is followed by the respective alterations in the Pthrp levels (Han et al., 2016). </p>
<p>Our hypothesis that Atoh8 differentially interacts with Ihh in regulating chondrocyte differentiation and hypertrophy is based on several lines of evidence: The data in Fig. 7E show that the Ihh expression is significantly decreased in Atoh8 mutants (around 40 % at E14.5 and around 70 % at E16.5) indicating that Atoh8 activates Ihh expression. The reduced Ihh expression is linked to an accelerated onset of hypertrophic differentiation as shown in Fig. 3D and 4E placing Atoh8 upstream of the Ihh/Pthrp system. This is supported by data from the limb explant cultures (Fig. 7A and B) demonstrating that activation of the Ihh/PthrP system by Purmorphamine increases the pool of proliferating chondrocytes independent of Atoh8 function. </p>
<p>Reduced Ihh levels will also lead to a reduced chondrocyte proliferation rate. However, the data shown in Fig. 7C and D indicate that activation of Ihh signaling does not rescue the proliferation rate downstream of Atoh8 strongly pointing to an Ihh independent or downstream function of Atoh8. A similar relationship has also been observed for FGF signaling which acts upstream of Ihh on the differentiation (inhibits Ihh expression) and independent or downstream on the proliferation rate (Minina et al. 2002). </p>
<p>In order to clarify the interdependency of Ihh and Pthrp, we changed the discussion in lines 516-528 (first version, see lines 548-561 in the revised version).</p>
<p>Response to reviewer #2:</p>
<p>1. The cultures prepared from E12.5 limb buds contain various cell populations. The results from this culture system should not be interpreted as the phenotype of chondrocytes.</p>
<p>We agree that micromass cultures can only supplement morphological in vivo data. In this context, we used this culture system to complement the observations made in the Atoh8 mutants (Fig. 5). The reduced Col2 expression and the reduced nodule formation in Atoh8-deficient cultures are in line with the reduced chondrocyte proliferation and the defects in initial chondrocyte differentiation we found in Atoh8 mutant mice (see also point 4 reviewer 1).</p>
<p>2. To identify and establish very modest differences in size of skeleton and histomorphometric parameter of growth-plate, the authors need to have appropriate control and analyze enough number of specimens. In this study, the authors always used Cre negative littermates as control, but the strains of the parent mice are not given. If the compound mice generated in this study came from more than 2 strains, they need to consider impact of genetic drift on skeletal growth difference. Col2Cre could be another control mouse. The sample size for analysis of skeleton length is 3-4, which may not be enough to conclude the growth retardation in the mutant mice. It is not provided how many biological different samples were used for histological analysis although the sample size ranges 10-12? It should be provided how they define the anatomical landmark to orient the limbs and to secure the longest or same tissue level for measurement of various histological parameters.</p>
<p>As stated in our discussion Atoh8 deletion results in a modest bone phenotype, which due to the biological variability is difficult to analyze using conventional statistical analyses. Therefore, we implemented a Bayesian probability based statistical analysis, which takes differences between litters and experiments into account and allows to generate meaningful data with relatively low sample sizes and animal numbers. </p>
<p>In addition, we added detailed information about the sample numbers (see figure legends), the numbers of sections analyzed and a more detailed description about how the measurements were performed (see lines 118, 131, 146). </p>
<p>Both Cre lines have been used in multiple studies and no effect of the Cre allele has been published to our knowledge. To further exclude effects of the Cre driver line, we compared the bone length of mutant, heterozygous and control mice (Fig. S2). These data show, that the reduced bone length is based on the Atoh8 deletion and not on the Cre recombinase (Fig. S2). Moreover, we analyzed two mouse strains with different Cre recombinases at different stages in our study (Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5) and found comparable differences between mutants and controls making it unlikely that the effect observed is due to two different Cre alleles. </p>
<p>To exclude strain differences all mouse lines were kept on a C57BL/6J background and mutants were compared to littermates.</p>
<p>3. By searching "GenePaint" database, the reviewer found other members of Atoh families are also expressed in developing skeleton. Are there functional redundancies among other family members? Have you checked expression of other Atoh transcription factors? These points are required to reach conclusion on the exclusive role of Atoh 8 in endochondral ossification.</p>
<p>As the reviewer mentioned, in situ hybridization data of sagittal E14.5 sections available at &#8220;GenePaint&#8221; indicate an expression of other Atoh genes in the developing skeleton. Based on this, we performed qPCR analyses to test the expression of Atoh1, Atoh2, Atoh3, Atoh4, Atoh5 and Atoh7 in forelimb skeletal elements of E14.5 control and Atoh8-deficient embryos. We could however not detect expression of any of these Atoh genes in control or Atoh8-deficient mice indicating that there is no functional redundancy or compensation during endochondral ossification. We added these results as Fig. S4 to the supplementary material.</p>
