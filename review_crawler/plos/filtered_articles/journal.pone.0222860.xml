<title>Background</title>
<p>Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women. However, there remains no consensus in current literature on the incidence of autoimmune diseases among breast cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risks of major autoimmune diseases (MAD) including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sj&#246;gren's syndrome (SS) and dermatomyositis (DMtis)/polymyositis (PM) in female breast cancer patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Using the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) records from 2003 to 2013, we identified newly-diagnosed female breast cancer patients and randomly selected females without breast cancer in the period 2007 to 2013 into a control group. We matched the two cohorts using a 1:4 ratio based on age, and the year of index date for comparison of the risk of major autoimmune diseases. We estimated and compared the relative risks of autoimmune diseases in female breast cancer patients and females without breast cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 54,311 females with breast cancer and 217,244 matched females without breast cancer were included in this study. For SLE, the incidence rates were 2.3 (breast cancer group) vs. 10.0 (control group) per 100,000 women years; for RA rates were 19.3 (breast cancer group) vs. 42.7 (control group) per 100,000 women years; and for SS rates were 20.5 (breast cancer group) vs. 38.2 (control group) per 100,000 women years. After adjusting for potential confounders, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for female breast cancer patients vs. control group were 0.04 (0.01&#8211;0.24) for SLE; 0.03 (0.02&#8211;0.04) for RA; and 0.21 (0.09&#8211;0.48) for SS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Female breast cancer patients had lower risks of SLE, RA and SS when compared to female individuals without breast cancer. However, there was no significant difference in the risk of developing DMtis/PM between both groups.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women. In Taiwan, autoimmune diseases were three to four times more common in women than in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref001">1</xref>]. However, there remains no consensus on the incidence rates of autoimmune diseases among breast cancer patients.</p>
<p>Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref002">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref004">4</xref>] have demonstrated that breast cancer patients showed an increased spontaneous expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte&#8211;associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) on T lymphocytes in breast tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, leading to impaired T cell activation. T cell activation is involved in the development of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref005">5</xref>], systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref006">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref007">7</xref>], Sj&#246;gren's syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref008">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref009">9</xref>], dermatomyositis (DMtis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref010">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref011">11</xref>] and polymyositis (PM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref010">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref011">11</xref>]. Abatacept is a fusion protein, which links the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 to the Fc region of immunoglobulin IgG1. Abatacept, which works by interfering with the immune activity of T cells, has been used in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref012">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref015">15</xref>], and is approved for RA therapy. DMtis/PM has been found to be associated with various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref016">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref019">19</xref>], including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref020">20</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that breast cancer patients may have a lower risk of major autoimmune diseases, except DMtis and PM.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) is available for research purposes and has facilitated nationwide, population-based longitudinal studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of major autoimmune diseases in female breast cancer patients using the NHIRD.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>The study was permitted by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Taichung Veterans General Hospital (IRB number: CE17100B). The requirement for informed consent was waived, since personal information was anonymized.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>This study was a retrospective cohort study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Data source</title>
<p>The data set were extracted from the NHIRD database using data from the period 2003 to 2013. In 1995, Taiwan initiated a compulsory National Health Insurance (NHI) program. The NHI program currently covers over 99% of the Taiwanese population. The NHIRD includes comprehensive data regarding medication prescription, ambulatory care services, admission services and traditional medical services. Some personal data and history such as body weight, body length, alcohol use, and smoking, are not available in the NHIRD. By updating original medical records regularly, the Bureau of NHI has improved the accuracy of data in the NHIRD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref021">21</xref>]. The NHIRD is managed by the National Health Research Institute (NHRI). The NHRI provides research data from the database to researchers after anonymizing all personal information.</p>
<p>We utilized multiple NHIRD datasets in this study, including data on both inpatients and outpatients, as well as enrollment data from 2003 to 2013. In 2000, the NHRI randomly selected and enrolled one million representative individuals from the NHIRD, establishing the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID2000). Since we were unable to get all the data in NHIRD, we selected the non-breast cancer control group from the LHID cohort. We used LHID2000 claims data from 2003 to 2013 for analysis of the comparison cohort.</p>
<p>The Bureau of NHI also established a registry of patients with possible fatal illnesses, such as malignancies, SLE, RA, SS and DMtis/PM. Patients with a possible fatal illness were issued a catastrophic illness certificate and were exempt from copayment for all medications prescribed for a corresponding possible fatal illness diagnosis. However, a catastrophic illness certificate was issued only after a thorough review and validation of original medical records by two or more qualified specialists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Definition of female breast cancer patients</title>
<p>Female breast cancer patients were defined as having a catastrophic illness certificate for breast cancer [International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 174].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>Definition of major autoimmune diseases</title>
<p>Major autoimmune diseases in this study included SLE, RA, SS and DMtis/PM. Patients with major autoimmune diseases were defined as having a catastrophic illness certificate for SLE (ICD-9-CM code 710.0), RA (ICD-9-CM code 714.x), SS (ICD-9-CM code 710.2) or DMtis (ICD-9-CM code 710.3)/PM (ICD-9-CM code 710.4).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Study outcome</title>
<p>The study outcome was the time from the index date to the time of the first diagnosis for major autoimmune diseases. We defined the censor date as December 31, 2013 (the last date of the database used) or the date of withdrawal from the NHI for emigration or death.</p>

<title>Study subjects</title>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Newly-diagnosed female breast cancer patients from entire Taiwanese population</title>
<p>Using NHIRD information from 2003 to 2013, we identified 67,552 newly-diagnosed female breast cancer patients between 2007 and 2013 as the female breast cancer cohort. The index date for female breast cancer patients was defined as the first date of application for a female breast cancer catastrophic illness certificate. After excluding patients with a history of an ambulatory or inpatient visit resulting in diagnosis of any autoimmune disease including SLE (ICD-9-CM 710.1), RA (ICD-9-CM 714.0), SS (ICD-9-CM 710.2), DMtis (ICD-9-CM 710.3) and PM (ICD-9-CM 710.4), we included 62,570 newly-diagnosed female breast cancer patients as our female breast cancer cohort.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec015">
<title>Matched non-breast cancer female individuals selected from a one million representative population</title>
<p>Using LHID2000 information from 2003 to 2013, we identified 430,530 female individuals without breast cancer as the control group. After excluding patients with a history of an ambulatory or inpatient visit resulting in diagnosis of any autoimmune disease including SLE (ICD-9-CM 710.1), RA (ICD-9-CM 714.0), SS (ICD-9-CM 710.2), DMtis (ICD-9-CM 710.3) and PM (ICD-9-CM 710.4), 409,340 female non-breast cancer individuals were included before matching.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec016">
<title>Matching female breast cancer patients and female non-breast cancer individuals with a 1:4 ratio</title>
<p>We recorded baseline differences between the female breast cancer cohort and the female non-breast cancer individuals to conduct propensity score matching (1:4). We used a multivariable logistic regression model to calculate the propensity score. The baseline variables for calculating the propensity score included age and year of index date (index year). We used the date of the first ambulatory or inpatient visit for any reason in the index year as the index date for female non-breast cancer individuals. Those who had a major autoimmune disease diagnosis before the index date were excluded. Finally, we included 54,311 female breast cancer patients and 217,244 matched female non-breast cancer individuals as the study subjects.</p>

<title>Potential confounders</title>
<p>Potential confounders included age, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and concomitant medications including hormone therapy (i.e., Tamoxifen, anastrozole and letrozole) and chemotherapy (i.e., cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, methotrexate, fluorouracil, cisplatin, carboplatin). The CCI, as adapted by Deyo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref022">22</xref>], was used to represent the level of general comorbid medical conditions. For female breast cancer patients, breast cancer was not included for calculating CCI. The presence of a comorbidity was defined as having at least three ambulatory visits or one inpatient visit with a corresponding ICD-9-CM code within 1 year before the index date. Use of concomitant medication was defined as prescription of corresponding medications during the follow-up period.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Continuous variables are shown as a mean &#177; standard deviation and categorical variables as a percentage of subjects. We tested the differences between continuous variables by using Student&#8217;s <italic>t</italic>-test and between categorical variables by using Pearson&#8217;s &#967;<sup>2</sup> test. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the incidences of major autoimmune diseases between groups. We quantified the associations between breast cancer and the development of SLE, RA, SS, DMtis /PM by estimating hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs using Cox regression analysis adjusting for age, CCI, hormone therapy and chemotherapy. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>The incidence rates of autoimmune diseases in both the female breast cancer cohort and female non-breast cancer cohort are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222860.t002">Table 2</xref>. Among female breast cancer patients, the incidence rate of SLE was 2.3 per 100,000 women years, the incidence rate of RA was 19.3 per 100,000 women years, the incidence rate of SS was 20.5 per 100,000 women years and the incidence rate of DMtis/PM was 2.3 per 100,000 women years. In the female non-breast cancer cohort, the incidence rate of SLE was 10.0 per 100,000 women years, the incidence rate of RA was 42.7 per 100,000 women years, the incidence rate of SS was 38.2 per 100,000 women years and the incidence rate of DMtis/PM was 1.7 per 100,000 women years. After adjusting for age, CCI, hormone therapy and chemotherapy, the HZs with corresponding 95% CIs for females breast cancer patients vs. control group were 0.04 (0.01&#8211;0.24) for SLE; 0.03 (0.02&#8211;0.04) for RA; and 0.21 (0.09&#8211;0.48) for SS. However, the risk of DMtis/PM was not significantly different between the female breast cancer group and the control group (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.08&#8211;1.80).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This nationwide, population-based, matched cohort study was the first to investigate the risks of developing major autoimmune diseases including SLE, RA, SS, DMtis /PM, among female breast cancer patients. After adjusting for age, CCI, hormone therapy and chemotherapy, we found that patients with female breast cancer had a significant lower risk of developing SLE, RA, and SS, but not DMtis/PM compared to the control group.</p>
<p>The mechanism of lower autoimmune disease incidence rates in female breast cancer patients remains unknown. Jaberipour et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref002">2</xref>] showed higher CTLA-4 expression and higher activity of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of female breast cancer patients. Mao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref003">3</xref>] demonstrated abnormal expression and dysregulation of CTLA-4 in female breast cancer patients. Khalife et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref004">4</xref>] found overexpression of Treg-related markers and higher activity of Treg cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of female breast cancer patients. Treg cells play an important role in the regulation of immune activities and maintain tolerance to self-antigens by suppressing antigen-presenting cells via CTLA-4. Overexpression of Treg-related markers and higher activity of Treg cells affect the immune system in female breast cancer patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that female breast cancer patients may have a decreased risk of autoimmune diseases and our results showed female breast cancer patients had a significant lower risk of developing SLE, RA and SS. On the other hand, several clinical immunotherapy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref023">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref024">24</xref>] used Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody which targeted to CTLA-4 and activated the immune system, and showed rheumatic and musculoskeletal adverse effects in their trials.</p>
<p>DMtis and PM are chronic inflammatory diseases, and DMtis/PM patients have skeletal, muscle and skin symptoms. After reviewing DMtis/PM patients, Fang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref020">20</xref>] demonstrated a high frequency of malignancies (17.2%), and found the most common malignancies were nasopharyngeal cancer and female breast cancer. The cause of DMtis/PM is not clear. However, pathology studies have shown autoantibody in muscle biopsies, as discussed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref025">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref026">26</xref>]. According to Engel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref027">27</xref>], muscle biopsies showed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B cells in DMtis/PM patients. Of the other autoantibodies discussed in recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref028">28</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref029">29</xref>], the most common in DMtis and PM patients were anti-SSA, anti-Ro-52 and anti-PMScl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref030">30</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref031">31</xref>]. Shah et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222860.ref032">32</xref>] demonstrated that DMtis-associated autoantibodies were detectable in female breast cancer patients who had clinically specific rheumatic diseases. These cancer-associated autoantibodies may explain why the incidence rates of DMtis/PM were not significantly different between the female breast cancer cohort and the female non-breast cancer cohort.</p>
<p>This study has some limitations that should be addressed. Firstly, the accuracy of diagnoses based on data from NHIRD was of concern. However, the use of the catastrophic illness certificate to confirm the diagnosis of breast cancer and MADs may have increased the accuracy of diagnoses. Secondly, some potential confounders including smoking, drinking and over-the counter medications were not included in the claims data. Thirdly, treatment options varied depending on the particular disease, patients&#8217; condition, physicians&#8217; discretion and period of diagnosis. All of these could have affected individual immune responses, the incidence rates and risks of developing autoimmune diseases. Finally, these results may not be generalized to non-Taiwanese populations. In order to eliminate confounding factors, we adjusted for variables, including age, CCI, hormone therapy and chemotherapy. Further studies are still required to clarify the mechanisms of different autoimmune diseases in breast cancer patients.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This nationwide, population-based cohort study showed that female breast cancer patients had lower risks of SLE, RA and SS when compared to female individuals without breast cancer. However, there was no significant difference in the risk of developing DMtis/PM between both groups. Further studies are warranted to clarify the mechanisms of these diseases in female breast cancer patients.</p>

<p>Risk of Major Autoimmune Diseases in Patients with Female Breast Cancer: a Nationwide, Population-based Cohort Study.</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Chien-Chih Chen,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>As you can see in the comments, both reviewers concluded that the basic data deserves to be published&#160;if certain changes, corrections and specifications have been made.&#160;&#160;In addition, both reviewers pay attention to partly erroneous or awkward usage of English language and medical expressions. I agree with the comments and strongly encourage you to&#160;improve the text by proficient language editing and to carefully respond to the detailed comments of Reviewer 2.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by September 7, 2019. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Pirkko L. H&#228;rk&#246;nen, M.D., Ph.D.</p>
<p>Academic Editor</p>
<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Journal requirements:</p>
<p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
<p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>2. We suggest you thoroughly copyedit your manuscript for language usage, spelling, and grammar. If you do not know anyone who can help you do this, you may wish to consider employing a professional scientific editing service. &#160;</p>
<p>Whilst you may use any professional scientific editing service of your choice, PLOS has partnered with both American Journal Experts (AJE) and Editage to provide discounted services to PLOS authors. Both organizations have experience helping authors meet PLOS guidelines and can provide language editing, translation, manuscript formatting, and figure formatting to ensure your manuscript meets our submission guidelines. To take advantage of our partnership with AJE, visit the AJE website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://learn.aje.com/plos/" ns0:type="simple">http://learn.aje.com/plos/</ext-link>) for a 15% discount off AJE services. To take advantage of our partnership with Editage, visit the Editage website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.editage.com" ns0:type="simple">www.editage.com</ext-link>) and enter referral code PLOSEDIT for a 15% discount off Editage services.&#160; If the PLOS editorial team finds any language issues in text that either AJE or Editage has edited, the service provider will re-edit the text for free.</p>
<p>Upon resubmission, please provide the following:</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;The name of the colleague or the details of the professional service that edited your manuscript</p>

<p>Reviewers' comments:</p>
<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Partly</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: I Don't Know</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This study makes use of the large Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to compare the incidence rates of autoimmune diseases in breast patients and propensity score matched non-breast cancer individuals. The study design is well powered, data analysis is clean, and results are unambiguous.</p>
<p>I only have some minor comments&#8212;</p>

<p>2) There is a typo in Abstract &#8220;1:4&#8221; instead of &#8220;1:40&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: General comments</p>
<p>The idea is novel, and inspired by very up-to-date science: the importance of immune responses in breast cancer. In the US, there about 300 clinical studies registered on this issue. This study illustrates the potential for immunotherapy.</p>
<p>The paper needs English editing to give an impression of serious science. Too many typing errors that I can correct them all. I also think many sentences can be written better, for example, I think this heading is better &#8220;Risk of Major Autoimmune Diseases in female breast Cancer: a Population-based Cohort Study&#8221;. First sentence in the abstract &#8220;Breast cancer is one of common malignancy among women&#8221; illustrates the low level of proficiency in English.</p>
<p>Method: The method needs to be better described and justified. Why not using all the data in NHRID? Then they need not to match and later adjust for covariates. This is a case-control cohort study. Breast cancers are recorded during 2007-13, while non-breast cancer patients are recorded during the period 2003-2013. This can make problems, I think. If not, please explain. Why not use all the population in NHRID, split them in breast cancer patients and not breast cancer patients at start, and then follow them up until disease (and censor them). Then you have a prospective cohort study, and less variables to adjust for. The potential risk of biased outcome/false positive reporting in this study is related to the adjustment.</p>
<p>In Table 2, I would like to see estimates before adjustment of adjuvant therapy. Adjustment for CIC and adjuvant therapy may generate over-adjustment. You adjust for the same disease twice, unless you think that adjuvant therapy directly influence on the risk of autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>Minor comments</p>
<p>Abstract, Method: the ratio is 1:4, I think. You are not matching on sex, I think. You are excluding males.</p>
<p>Page numbers are missing. Would be fine with line numbers too.</p>
<p>Introduction, second sentence. Delete &#8220;prevalence&#8221;. Only focus on incidence, because women live longer than men do. Thus, comparing prevalence rates is not meaningful.</p>
<p>Last sentence, last paragraph, introduction (especially 6th last line): bad English, too long sentence. Furthermore, the aim/hypothesis to study has already been presented in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>Data source, first paragraph, forth sentence: The word &#8220;claims&#8221; is not necessary. Sufficient to write &#8220;&#8230; comprehensive data regarding&#8230;&#8221; Last sentence: &#8220;provides data&#8221; and not &#8220;databases&#8221; to researchers.</p>
<p>I think &#8220;catastrophic illness&#8221; is not the proper word to use. &#8220;Possible fatal illness&#8221;, is probably better.</p>
<p>Definition of female breast cancer patients: CIC is not defined. And not MAD either, in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Potential confounders: gender??? I suggest excluding all male breast cancer patients from start and only study women. Then adjusting for gender is not necessary.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses: I think you have done a case-control cohort study.</p>

<p>Response to reviewers:</p>
<p>Dear Editors-in-Chief and Reviewers,</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This study makes use of the large Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to compare the incidence rates of autoimmune diseases in breast patients and propensity score matched non-breast cancer individuals. The study design is well powered, data analysis is clean, and results are unambiguous.</p>
<p>I only have some minor comments&#8212;</p>
<p>1) In title the expression &#8220;in patients with female breast cancer&#8221; is awkward. Please consider rephrase it, for example, as &#8220;in female patients with breast cancer&#8221;?</p>
<p>Response: We had rephrased it as &#8216;in female breast cancer&#8217;.</p>
<p>2) There is a typo in Abstract &#8220;1:4&#8221; instead of &#8220;1:40&#8221;.</p>
<p>Response: We correct it.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: General comments</p>
<p>General comments</p>
<p>The idea is novel, and inspired by very up-to-date science: the importance of immune responses in breast cancer. In the US, there about 300 clinical studies registered on this issue. This study illustrates the potential for immunotherapy.</p>
<p>The paper needs English editing to give an impression of serious science. Too many typing errors that I can correct them all. I also think many sentences can be written better, for example, I think this heading is better &#8220;Risk of Major Autoimmune Diseases in female breast Cancer: a Population-based Cohort Study&#8221;. First sentence in the abstract &#8220;Breast cancer is one of common malignancy among women&#8221; illustrates the low level of proficiency in English.</p>
<p>Response: We have rephrased the title. Changes have been made pertaining to language and grammar.</p>
<p>Method: The method needs to be better described and justified. Why not using all the data in NHRID? Then they need not to match and later adjust for covariates. This is a case-control cohort study. Breast cancers are recorded during 2007-13, while non-breast cancer patients are recorded during the period 2003-2013. This can make problems, I think. If not, please explain. Why not use all the population in NHRID, split them in breast cancer patients and not breast cancer patients at start, and then follow them up until disease (and censor them). Then you have a prospective cohort study, and less variables to adjust for. The potential risk of biased outcome/false positive reporting in this study is related to the adjustment.</p>
<p>Response: </p>
<p>1. Because we were unable to get all the data in NHIRD, the only way to get matched non-breast cancer individuals was to use the one million representative population in the LHID2000. We have added a statement in Line 8 of page 6: &#8220;Because we were unable to get all the data in NHIRD, we selected the non-breast cancer comparison cohort from the population in the LHID2000.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. The periods of datasets for the female breast cancer cohort and the comparison cohort are the same (i.e., from 2003 to 2013). To identify new cases of breast cancer during 2007&#8211;2013, we excluded patients who had a diagnosis of breast cancer before 2007. To eliminate the differences of diagnosis and treatment in different era, the comparison cohort was also matched for the diagnosis date of female breast cancer patients.</p>
<p>In Table 2, I would like to see estimates before adjustment of adjuvant therapy. Adjustment for CIC and adjuvant therapy may generate over-adjustment. You adjust for the same disease twice, unless you think that adjuvant therapy directly influence on the risk of autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>Response: </p>
<p>1. Chemotherapy and hormone therapy may affect lymphocytes and other immune cells, affecting the risk of autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>2. CCI was used to represent the level of general comorbid medical conditions. For female breast cancer patients, breast cancer was not included for calculating CCI. Therefore, we did not adjust for the same disease twice. We ahve added a statment in Line 8 of page 9: &#8220;For female breast cancer patients, breast cancer was not included for calculating CCI. &#8221;</p>
<p>Minor comments</p>
<p>Abstract, Method: the ratio is 1:4, I think. You are not matching on sex, I think. You are excluding males.</p>
<p>Response: Since we have excluded males, we did not match the sex. We have removed &#8220;sex&#8221; in the list of matched variables.</p>
<p>Page numbers are missing. Would be fine with line numbers too.</p>
<p>Response: We have added continuous page and line numbers.</p>
<p>Introduction, second sentence. Delete &#8220;prevalence&#8221;. Only focus on incidence, because women live longer than men do. Thus, comparing prevalence rates is not meaningful.</p>
<p>Response: We have corrected it according to your suggestion.</p>
<p>Last sentence, last paragraph, introduction (especially 6th last line): bad English, too long sentence. Furthermore, the aim/hypothesis to study has already been presented in the previous paragraph. </p>
<p>Response: We have revised the statement for concision a follows. &#8220;The aim of this study was to investigate the risks of major autoimmune diseases in female breast cancer patients using the NHIRD.&#8221; We have deleted a redundant statement regarding the hypothesis.</p>
<p>Data source, first paragraph, forth sentence: The word &#8220;claims&#8221; is not necessary. Sufficient to write &#8220;&#8230; comprehensive data regarding&#8230;&#8221; Last sentence: &#8220;provides data&#8221; and not &#8220;databases&#8221; to researchers.</p>
<p>Response: We have corrected it based on your suggestions.</p>
<p>I think &#8220;catastrophic illness&#8221; is not the proper word to use. &#8220;Possible fatal illness&#8221;, is probably better.</p>
<p>Response: We have used &#8220;possible fatal illness&#8221; to describe the characteristics of these diseases. However, the official name of the certificate for patients with these &#8220;possible fatal illness&#8221; is &#8220;catastrophic illness certificate&#8221; in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Definition of female breast cancer patients: CIC is not defined. And not MAD either, in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Response: </p>
<p>1. To avoid confusion with CCI, we have removed the abbreviation of CIC and used &#8220;catastrophic illness certificate&#8221; in the manuscript. </p>
<p>2. Because MAD is not a common abbreviation, we have deleted this abbreviation and used the entire definition &#8220;major autoimmune disease&#8221; in manuscript.</p>
<p>Potential confounders: gender??? I suggest excluding all male breast cancer patients from start and only study women. Then adjusting for gender is not necessary.</p>
<p>Response: Because we have excluded males, we have removed &#8220;gender&#8221; in the list of potential confounders.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses: I think you have done a case-control cohort study. </p>
<p>Response: This study is a retrospective cohort study and not case-control study. Therefore, we have used the Cox regression analysis.</p>
