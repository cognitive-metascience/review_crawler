<title>Background</title>
<p>Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems play a key role in upholding human rights and generating data for health and good governance. They also can help monitor progress in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Although many countries have made substantial progress in strengthening their CRVS systems, most low- and middle-income countries still have underdeveloped systems. The objective of this systematic review is to identify national policies that can help countries strengthen their systems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods and findings</title>
<p>The ABI/INFORM, Embase, JSTOR, PubMed, and WHO Index Medicus databases were systematically searched for policies to improve birth and/or death registration on 24 January 2017. Global stakeholders were also contacted for relevant grey literature. For the purposes of this review, policies were categorised as supply, demand, incentive, penalty, or combination (i.e., at least two of the preceding policy approaches). Quantitative results on changes in vital event registration rates were presented for individual comparative articles. Qualitative systematic review methodology, including meta-ethnography, was used for qualitative syntheses on operational considerations encompassing acceptability to recipients and staff, human resource requirements, information technology or infrastructure requirements, costs to the health system, unintended effects, facilitators, and barriers. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018085768. Thirty-five articles documenting experience in implementing policies to improve birth and/or death registration were identified. Although 25 countries representing all global regions (Africa, the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean) were reflected, there were limited countries from the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe regions. Twenty-four articles reported policy effects on birth and/or death registration. Twenty-one of the 24 articles found that the change in registration rate after the policy was positive, with two supply and one penalty articles being the exceptions. The qualitative syntheses identified 15 operational considerations across all policy categories. Human and financial resource requirements were not quantified. The primary limitation of this systematic review was the threat of publication bias wherein many countries may not have documented their experience; this threat is most concerning for policies that had neutral or negative effects.</p>

<sec id="sec003">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our systematic review suggests that combination policy approaches, consisting of at least a supply and demand component, were consistently associated with improved registration rates in different geographical contexts. Operational considerations should be interpreted based on health system, governance, and sociocultural context. More evaluations and research are needed from the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe regions. Further research and evaluation are also needed to estimate the human and financial resource requirements required for different policies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Civil registration is defined as the continuous, permanent, compulsory, and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events in accordance with the legal requirements in each nation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref001">1</xref>]. Vital events captured in civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems include the registration of births, deaths (including cause of death), marriages, adoptions, and divorces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref001">1</xref>]. Civil registration and supporting legal documentation provide individuals with proof of legal identity, help establish their right to acquire nationality, allow individuals to exercise a broad range of rights, and facilitate access to essential services including social welfare, education, health, and legal protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref002">2</xref>]. Systematic compilation of civil registration data into vital statistics also provides the demographic information necessary for good governance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref003">3</xref>]. For example, birth and death data can help monitor population growth and movement and inform fiscal policy. Within the health sector, functioning CRVS systems with a medically certified cause of death both provide an individual with the legal documents they need to access health, inheritance, and legal protection and the country with the data needed to estimate national and subnational burden of disease, the impact of different disease programmes, and the cost-effectiveness of disease interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref004">4</xref>]. Birth and death registration data are also essential to inform health service needs and coverage. These functions are critical to monitoring progress in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The systematic recording of vital events in many countries remains a serious challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref005">5</xref>]. In the absence of reliable CRVS data, household surveys have become a key source of data to monitor levels and trends in births, deaths, and other core population indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref006">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref009">9</xref>]. In most low- and middle-income countries, such surveys represent the sole source of this information. Unfortunately, many of these data sources are time limited, costly, externally supported, and not always current when published. Surveys also lack the local area CRVS data most effective for local public health planning. Locally developed and sustainable CRVS systems can provide a legal identity from birth, the fundamental documentation to claim a nationality, and generate granular strategic information both to successfully deliver services and improve planning, budgeting, and programming for health and other sectors.</p>
<p>Public health authorities primarily focus on notifying births, deaths, and causes of deaths to the civil authority to enter into the registration system used for decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref010">10</xref>]. Global guidelines are useful in establishing CRVS norms and standards for countries. The United Nations Statistics Division provides comprehensive guidance on how CRVS systems can achieve universal coverage, continuity, confidentiality, data quality, and regular dissemination in order to be a dependable and primary source of vital statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref011">11</xref>]. This guidance also suggests alternative sources and interim methods to generate vital statistics when CRVS systems are underdeveloped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref011">11</xref>]. Technical guidance from the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank Group, and various UN regional offices covers CRVS system strategic planning, legal frameworks, registration practices, birth certification, death certification and cause of death, quality of data according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), interim methods for vital statistics, and how to build political and community support for CRVS systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>All countries agreed to achieve the SDGs that specify targets related to CRVS, including (1) by 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration, (2) by 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely, and reliable disaggregated data, and (3) by 2030, build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable development that complement gross domestic product, and support statistical capacity-building in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref014">14</xref>]. CRVS systems also contribute to public health SDG targets, such as measuring progress towards ending the epidemics of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases, reducing maternal and child deaths, and reducing deaths due to noncommunicable diseases and road traffic accidents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref015">15</xref>]. Although there has been some progress in CRVS system development over the past two decades, birth and death registration rates continue to increase at a slow rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref016">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref018">18</xref>]. Worldwide, the proportion of children under five with a registered birth increased from 58% in 2000 to 65% in 2015 whilst the proportion of deaths registered increased from 36% to 38% during the same period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref019">19</xref>]. In addition to informing national mortality and life expectancy trends, death registration is also critical because it is the first step before determining causes of death. Unfortunately, independent assessments indicate that the majority of registered deaths have issues surrounding the quality of cause-of-death ascertainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref020">20</xref>]. For example, the latest data available from WHO indicate that while an average of 48% of registered deaths included cause of death, 18% of ICD cause-of-death reports used ill-defined ICD codes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref021">21</xref>]. Although significant progress was made in evaluating the role of information technology (IT) interventions in CRVS systems, non-technological interventions lack formal reviews and evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref023">23</xref>]. We systematically reviewed the evidence on national policy interventions to improve birth and death registration.</p>

<title>Study conduct</title>
<p>This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines using a predefined protocol (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews identification number, CRD42018085768) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref025">25</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002929.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002929.s002">S2</xref> Texts). The ABI/INFORM, Embase, JSTOR, PubMed, and WHO Index Medicus databases were systematically searched without language, publication, or any other limits on 24 January 2017. Given that the Statistical Commission of the United Nations adopted the <italic>International Programme for Accelerating the Improvement of Vital Statistics and Civil Registration Systems</italic> to assist countries with incomplete registration or entirely lacking a CRVS system in 1991, we included articles implemented and published from 1991 onward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref026">26</xref>]. All sources cited in the 2007 and 2015 CRVS Lancet series were reviewed for inclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref027">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref032">32</xref>]. Global stakeholders, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s International Statistics Program, United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, UN Statistics Division, World Bank Group, and WHO, were also contacted to provide relevant publications on CRVS systems and policies.</p>

<title>Eligibility criteria and search strategy</title>
<p>Per recommendations from the PRISMA group, eligibility criteria were based on key article characteristics: population, intervention, comparator, outcome, and design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref024">24</xref>]. Specifically, sources were included when (1) they comprised a population eligible for birth and/or death registration, (2) the intervention was a new national policy (i.e., novel legislation or change in programme implementation designed to improve birth and/or death registration), (3) the comparator includes the lack of the new policy, (4) the outcome was birth registration rate, death registration rate, timeliness of birth registration, timeliness of death registration, and/or operational considerations (i.e., acceptability to persons registering births or deaths, acceptability to staff managing and implementing birth or death registration, human resource requirements, costs to the health system, adverse events, and/or facilitators or barriers learnt during implementation), and (5) the article design was a cross-sectional, cohort, case-control, or randomised controlled trial. Articles did not require a minimum time period of follow-up to be eligible. Articles describing operational considerations did not require a comparator arm to be included. The search strategies were designed by a librarian to identify articles that met these eligibility criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002929.s003">S3 Text</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Study screening and extraction</title>
<p>Two investigators independently screened titles of all identified articles, followed by screening abstracts from relevant titles. The investigators then matched the full texts of all articles selected during abstract screening against the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third investigator. References for included articles were reviewed for additional reports. Articles failing to meet inclusion criteria were excluded from this review. Two investigators completed the data extraction using a standardised extraction form comprising four tables summarising setting, design, quantitative outcomes and results, and operational considerations.</p>

<title>Quantitative and qualitative syntheses</title>
<p>For the purpose of establishing a policy framework for this systematic review, we used the following mechanisms and definitions to guide our categorisation of individual articles: (1) supply (policies focussed on increasing accessibility, acceptability, and/or affordability of registration services), (2) demand (policies focussed on increasing awareness for registration through information, education, communication, and/or advocacy), (3) penalty (policies that penalise citizens for failing to register a birth or death), (4) incentive (policies that encourage citizens to register a birth or death), and (5) combination (a combination of at least two of the preceding policy mechanisms). Given that numerators and denominators were not provided for most quantitative results, data stabilisation, meta-analyses, and heterogeneity assessment could not be performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref033">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref035">35</xref>]. Instead, we presented individual article results on changes in vital event registration rates during policy implementation. In cases in which multiple articles reported quantitative results on an intervention from the same country, we reported results from the article with the longest period of follow-up.</p>
<p>We used Cochrane qualitative systematic review methodology, including meta-ethnography, to synthesise qualitative data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref036">36</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref040">40</xref>]. Meta-ethnography involved reciprocal translational analysis (comparison), refutational synthesis (contrast), and line of argument synthesis (high-level synthesis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref042">42</xref>]. We developed themes based on quotations from each article. These themes were then categorised into one of our operational considerations: (1) acceptability to staff, (2) human resource requirements, (3) IT or infrastructure requirements, (4) costs to the health system, (5) unintended effects, (6) facilitators, and (7) barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref043">43</xref>]. For reciprocal translation analysis, we compared similar themes from individual articles and synthesised operational considerations reflective of themes from multiple articles. For refutational synthesis, we contrasted themes and noted disagreements. Line of argument synthesis was used to synthesise operational considerations drawn from combination policy approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref042">42</xref>].</p>

In 1999, the Ministry of Health conducted an information campaign for birth registration. In 2000, the government created monetary incentives for civil registrars and health facilities to register births. This initially mandated states to create the monetary compensation themselves at state and local levels so that birth certificates would be issued without a fee. Later, the Ministry of Health issued the monetary incentives to hospitals directly for every birth registered. In addition, birth registration systems were integrated into maternity wards using outreach units. This project was accompanied by training of maternity ward staff. From 2004 to 2008, an online registration system was integrated with the maternity ward processes.</td>

Using this system, staff at hospitals or nursing homes register births and deaths online at the institution. The CSBs serve as a kiosk for individuals to access various identity-related services such as requesting a birth certificate. In 2006, Delhi also launched the project to link immunisation services with the birth registration process. Using maternity wards in Delhi, the registration and immunisation information systems were integrated. This way, healthcare workers at maternity wards provided both services together. This grew to include community-based services by midwives&#8212;which increased the coverage of the birth registration system.</td>

<td align="center">The Turkish Statistical Institute Death Reporting System (TURKSTAT-DRS) has undergone various governmental reforms since 2009. For example, the TURKSTAT system was integrated with the Central Population Administrative System (MERNIS) reporting form. This was useful because many rural areas lacking health practitioners only report the cause of death with this simple one-line MERNIS form, and register the deaths with the village headman instead. These new reforms reconcile between the TURKSTAT and MERNIS system by implementing routine system procedures for interoperability. Additionally, there has been enhanced coordination between the various local agencies responsible for death registration&#8212;with the main aim of improving registration completeness.</td>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This systematic review indicates that new policies have the potential to have positive long-term effects on improving birth and death registration rates. However, there are a variety of considerations needed to interpret these data correctly. For example, an intervention implemented at a subnational scale may face different operational issues and a different direction of effect when implemented nationally. One example of this is use of community-based registration services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref064">64</xref>]. This type of policy would be useful to fill a geographic void in rural settings but may prove redundant in many urban settings. Furthermore, in areas with poor telecommunication platforms and connectivity, mobile registration fills a void; however, in facilities that have computers with connectivity, it may prove redundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Although most articles reported effects on registration rates, registration rates should be contextualised as part of CRVS business processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref078">78</xref>]. The business process for death typically encompasses five steps: (1) the death itself, (2) notification of the death to a designated site, (3) registration of the death by the registration authority, (4) assigning the death a cause of death, and (5) including the causes of death in the national vital statistics system. The order of the steps is different for health facility deaths, for which the notification typically includes the cause of death. The business process for birth registration encompasses the first three steps and includes the issuance of the birth certificate. Future policy evaluations should report effects by steps in the business process. This may help countries understand policies&#8217; effects more comprehensively, identify bottlenecks in the registration process, and work towards improving birth and death registration for their context. For example, Kabadi and colleagues reported that both birth and death registration rates declined after implementing a supply policy in Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref076">76</xref>]. However, closer inspection of the data reveals that birth notifications improved 2-fold, while death notifications improved 5-fold with their intervention. The challenge in Tanzania appeared to be translating these increased notifications to registered events.</p>
<p>Universal access to birth and death registration services is important for clients to register vital events. Supply policy interventions consistently increased birth and death registration rates. The one article that showed a negative direction in the registration of births and deaths from Tanzania, discussed above, found increased birth and death notifications that did not translate into increased registration rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref076">76</xref>]. The policy quantitative and operational considerations synthesised should be considered based on the health system, governance, and sociocultural context of contributing articles. For example, fragile and conflict settings may need to consider a supply policy with community-based registration services, whilst settings with a high proportion of births and deaths occurring in health facilities would likely benefit from integration of registration services into health facilities. Moreover, the role of good governance should not be discounted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref079">79</xref>]. Despite enabling legislation in several countries, enforcement challenges at the subnational levels led to obstacles for clients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref073">73</xref>]. Across operational considerations, caution should be exercised in interpreting the findings due to the small sample size of articles with qualitative data.</p>
<p>Information, education, communication, and effective advocacy through demand-side policies can help strengthen implementation of functional CRVS systems by social and behavioural change. However, this approach may have limited utility without functional CRVS systems in place. Most articles that reported results of demand policies did so for policies that coupled demand along with other approaches. For example, 15 articles reported on a demand policy coupled with at least supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref073">73</xref>]. The single article that reported on a demand-only policy did so in a context, Mongolia, where birth and death registration rates already exceeded 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref057">57</xref>]. Therefore, the challenge in Mongolia was reaching the remaining few rather than increasing wide-scale access. This underscores the need to interpret the findings based on the health system, governance, and sociocultural context of contributing articles.</p>
<p>Countries took different approaches to utilising incentives for vital event registration, most of which included provision of a national identification card (ID) or certificate that was required for public service(s). Thailand and Botswana integrated national ID provision, which is required for a wide range of government services, with birth registration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref077">77</xref>]. Ensuring a life cycle of identity, starting with ensuring that every child is registered and issued a birth certificate and ending with recording the cause of death and providing the family with a death certificate, will maximise the full spectrum of rights and data generated by CRVS systems. For example, infants and young children are able to access life-saving medical interventions, including vaccines and access to early childhood education and nutrition services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref080">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref081">81</xref>]. For children and adolescents, a birth certificate is the first line of defense to be protected against child marriage, labour, and recruitment into armed forces. A birth certificate can also provide the legal identity needed for educational exams and to access higher education and the formal job market. For adults, they enable financial inclusion, social assistance, insurance, inheritance, and land rights. In Brazil, a birth certificate was required to enroll into the Bolsa Familia programme, in which a cash transfer was conditioned upon school enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref063">63</xref>]. In South Africa, birth certificates were required for child support grants and school enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref060">60</xref>]. Botswana and Bangladesh also require birth certificates for school enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref073">73</xref>]. Death certificates provide the evidence needed to access inheritance and land rights, often combined with marriage certificates to prove the legal family ties that establish rights to inheritance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref010">10</xref>]. This is especially important for women whose access to financial services and property are often through their husband. Death certificate use was more rare; Botswana reported requiring a death certificate for body burial, while Bangladesh reported requiring a death certificate to pass on inheritance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref073">73</xref>]. There were no articles evaluating direct financial incentives for registering births or deaths.</p>
<p>Due to limited data, it was not possible to conduct subanalyses. If data permitted, analysing effects by the country CRVS functional level would help inform policy categories that are most relevant based on their current CRVS system functional level. For example, any emerging policy to record births or deaths is unlikely to boost the registration rate if the key elements such as legal framework and national ID are not supported by a current policy. Further research is needed to validate these hypotheses. Nonetheless, combination approaches tailored to country context uniformly and consistently improved birth and death registration rates. Fifteen of the sixteen articles reporting on combination approaches included at least a supply and demand element, while six included a supply, demand, and incentive element. South Africa reported positive experiences collaborating with local universities in order to research how best to design supply policy interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref060">60</xref>].</p>
<p>The exclusion of individuals from registering a birth (establishing their legal identity) or obtaining a birth certificate (proof of legal identity) is often an unintended consequence of policy, rather than a deliberate effort by the state to exclude them. For example, laws (1) requiring documentary prerequisites (e.g. ID, birth/marriage certificates), (2) with paternity requirements (i.e. name or presence of the father), and/or (3) that impose fines/fees to discourage late registration may be designed with the intention of legitimising registration documents but can deter or legally even prevent women and the most vulnerable members of society from being included in civil registration systems. This systematic review did not identify evaluations of these types of policy changes.</p>
<p>There may be limitations with this systematic review. First, there is possibility of publication bias because many countries, or regions such as Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean, may not have documented policy interventions. Other countries may have documented changes in registration rates without explaining contributing policy shifts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref082">82</xref>]. Finally, policies that did not lead to positive effects may not have been documented at all by their investigators. Knowledge of what does not work is also critical for effective CRVS strengthening in countries. Moreover, given that there was no systematic way to search the grey literature, our grey literature search may have been limited in its sensitivity in the global stakeholders contacted. Including additional global stakeholders, such as the European Union, Plan International, United Nations Population Fund, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as well as regional stakeholders such as regional development banks, regional economic commissions of the United Nations, and regional technical assistance institutions, may further expand reach. We may have also missed relevant literature that predated our inclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1002929.ref083">83</xref>]. Because numerators and denominators for registration were not reported, meta-analysis was not possible. There were several methodological limitations of the studies included. First, given the limited amount of methodological detail provided by eligible articles, it was not possible to ascertain the quality of studies as was planned in the protocol. Second, most eligible studies were included on the basis of their qualitative data and did not have a comparator group to quantify policy effects. Finally, both the design and analytical approach of included quantitative articles limited inferences on causality. This underscores the need to carefully design, monitor, evaluate, and document future CRVS policies.</p>
<p>We identified several gaps in this systematic review. First, more information is needed on financial and human resource requirements for different policies. This information was rarely reported and is critical information required for decision-makers considering national or subnational implementation. Second, many of the articles had a short duration; continued monitoring is needed to understand effects of policies over time. Third, the articles did not provide detail on how migratory populations were registered for births and deaths and whether the findings presented were generalisable to them. Fourth, this systematic review focused on birth and death registration data directly collected from CRVS systems; including whether the policies had effects on additional health outcomes merits further research.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to our knowledge this systematic review provides the first comprehensive compilation of national policies to strengthen birth and death registration. Effective and enforced policies will play a critical role in improving birth and death registration globally. Countries will need to understand their barriers to identify which policy approaches are most appropriate to their context. Further research using a more systematic approach to intervention design and evaluation is needed to improve the knowledge of effects, resource requirements, and acceptability of policies for strengthening CRVS systems.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Requests from the editors:</p>
<p>1- Thank you for providing  your PRISMA statement. Please replace the page numbers with paragraph numbers per section (e.g. "Methods, paragraph 1"), since the page numbers of the final published paper may be different from the page numbers in the current manuscript.</p>
<p>2- Please edit the first section of the title to be less aspirational and more descriptive of the current study.</p>
<p>3- Please include the full dates of your search in the Abstract.</p>
<p>4- In the last sentence of the Abstract Methods and Findings section, please describe the main limitation(s) of the study's methodology.</p>
<p>5- At this stage, we ask that you include a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract. Please see our author guidelines for more information: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary" ns0:type="simple">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary</ext-link></p>
<p>6- The Abstract Conclusions, as well as the end of the discussion, should  be more qualified (&#8220;Our systematic review suggests&#8230;&#8221; or similar).</p>
<p>7- I believe the data statement should point to the primary articles, not the SI files. </p>
<p>8- Line 345, please add &#8220;to our knowledge&#8221; to qualify your assertion of primacy.</p>
<p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Alex McConnachie, Statistical Review</p>
<p>Suther et al provides a report on published evidence of the impact of policy initiatives to improve birth and death registration; this review looks at the use of statistics in the paper.</p>
<p>There is not much for me to review. The figures are quite good. The lack of meta-analysis is justified. My one thought in reading the paper is whether there might be some publication bias, if those implementing unsuccessful policies are reluctant to publicise their findings, but the authors acknowledge this as a limitation of their study. Overall, I found the paper to be interesting to read, and well written.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Overall a well written and interesting paper which fills a gap in current literature. A few minor points regarding specific language used below: </p>
<p>Line 82-83: The sentence indicates that household surveys are mainly used to monitor registration levels. It should be highlighted that in the absence of CRVS data, household surveys are used not only for registration completeness but also for key population indicators. </p>
<p>line 85-89, it is not only about health planning but planning more broadly</p>
<p>line 110-110: the references about slow progress are a bit outdated (most recent 2014) there has been a lot of progress since then (particularly in South Asia). Also, is an improvement from 58-63 per cent in 15 years slow progress?</p>
<p>line 245-246: registration coverage or registration completeness?</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: </p>
<p>The topic of the impact of national CRVS implementation policies on outcome on birth and death registration as well as timeliness of registration is an important one as the Lancet 2007 (Who Counts) and 2015 (Counting Births and Deaths) series indicate. In the 2015 series, Phillips et al used modelling to conclude that improved CRVS performance coincided with improved health outcomes.</p>
<p>This MA and SR reviews the evidence on national policy interventions to improve birth and death registration. It does not attempt to correlate policy interventions with improved health outcomes.</p>
<p>The methodology is solid; however, the policies were heterogeneous, the sample size small, and many regions of the world were not represented in the available literature.  While this is not the fault of the authors, it does limit the conclusions.</p>
<p>Given these limitations, I think this manuscript would better placed in a more specialized journal.  </p>
<p>Specific queries for the authors:</p>
<p>Making casual links between the policies and changes in birth or death rates would be challenging as policy effects must be taken into account with other country specific contexts such as political and economic instability, especially in fragile states.  More context understanding would be important and strengthen this associations (as mentioned by the authors). </p>
<p>The analysis of the operational considerations was very interesting. However, conclusions that can be drawn might be limited to the small sample size. </p>
<p>The applicability of one policy to another country may be limited given the differences in contexts. For example, the conclusion that a demand only policy might not be effective was based on an n=1.  1 reported this (Mongolia) where 90% coverage was already achieved.</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<p>24/33 studies had no comparator group which means the effect of supply, demand, and intervention policies on birth registration was determine from small sample size (n=9). Pls address this in discussion</p>
<p>Similarly Figure 4 only has 5 studies reporting policy effect on death registration. What conclusions can be made from this?</p>
<p>How can the authors conclude a new national CRVS policy has a casual effect and how can one draw conclusions from the heterogeneous types of policy intervention and the varying country contexts? There will be so much noise from whatever else is happening in the country at the time that the actual effect of the new policy is difficult to determine.</p>
<p>This methodology does not capture migratory populations</p>
<p>What about costing of vital records systems? The authors mention "financial"</p>
<p>Europe not represented. Is this bc they are already have robust systems?</p>
<p>No comments on this in paper. Even historicaly? </p>
<p>Is there precedent that CRVS national policies impact health outcomes (other than modelling studies)?</p>
<p>Can Taiwan really be considered a territory of China? (Lu, 2002)?</p>
<p>Past-present tense issues</p>
<p>The Village Executive Officer can access this application and view trends in notifications, and even see when a notification was made but no certificate was acquired. </p>
<p>One of the sections is termed, "Impact on birth and death registration rates &#8232;</p>
<p>Can you make such a strong statement as to say a specific policy had a negative or positive change on birth or death registration rates? This suggests casuality. Wouldn't association be a more accurate term?</p>

<p>Requests from Editors:</p>
<p>1- Thank you for editing the Title. I still think it could be more descriptive though. Perhaps: &#8220;Evaluation of approaches to strengthen civil registration and vital statistics systems: a systematic review and synthesis of policies in 25 countries&#8221;</p>
<p>2- Thank you for including an Author Summary. Some of the bullet points are a bit lengthy (eg, point 3 of the &#8220;What Did the Researchers Do and Find?&#8221; section), please cut a bit or split into multiple bullets (but not sub-points).</p>
<p>3- The limitation that most studies did not have a comparator group could be mentioned in the Discussion, along with the other methodological limitations of the studies included.</p>
<p>4- Discussion limitations could also note the geographic limitations, eg very few European countries represented.</p>
<p>5- Please include your response regarding Taiwan inthe main text.</p>
<p>6- Line 253: "Association with birth and death registration rates"?</p>

<p>Dear Dr. Suthar, </p>
<p>On behalf of my colleagues and the academic editor, Dr. Margaret Kruk, I am delighted to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Evaluation of approaches to strengthen civil registration and vital statistics systems: a systematic review and synthesis of policies in 25 countries" (PMEDICINE-D-19-01902R2) has been accepted for publication in PLOS Medicine. </p>
<p>PRODUCTION PROCESS</p>
<p>Before publication you will see the copyedited word document (in around 1-2 weeks from now) and a PDF galley proof shortly after that. The copyeditor will be in touch shortly before sending you the copyedited Word document. We will make some revisions at the copyediting stage to conform to our general style, and for clarification. When you receive this version you should check and revise it very carefully, including figures, tables, references, and supporting information, because corrections at the next stage (proofs) will be strictly limited to (1) errors in author names or affiliations, (2) errors of scientific fact that would cause misunderstandings to readers, and (3) printer's (introduced) errors.</p>
<p>If you are likely to be away when either this document or the proof is sent, please ensure we have contact information of a second person, as we will need you to respond quickly at each point.</p>
<p>PRESS</p>
<p>A selection of our articles each week are press released by the journal. You will be contacted nearer the time if we are press releasing your article in order to approve the content and check the contact information for journalists is correct. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximize its impact. </p>
