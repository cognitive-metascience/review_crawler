<abstract>
<p>Early industrialization and the development of cheap production processes for paper have led to an exponential accumulation of paper-based documents during the last two centuries. Archives and libraries harbor vast amounts of ancient and modern documents and have to undertake extensive endeavors to protect them from abiotic and biotic deterioration. While services for mechanical preservation such as <italic>ex post</italic> de-acidification of historic documents are already commercially available, the possibilities for long-term protection of paper-based documents against fungal attack (apart from temperature and humidity control) are very limited. Novel processes for mechanical enhancement of damaged cellulosic documents use Ionic Liquids (IL) as essential process components. With some of these ILs having azole-functionalities similar to well-known fungicides such as Clotrimazole, the possibility of antifungal activities of these ILs was proposed but has not yet been experimentally confirmed. We evaluated the potency of four ILs with potential application in paper restoration for suppression of fungal growth on five relevant paper-infesting molds. The results revealed a general antifungal activity of all ILs, which increased with the size of the non-polar group. Physiological experiments and ultimate elemental analysis allowed to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration of each IL as well as the residual IL concentration in process-treated paper. These results provide valuable guidelines for IL-applications in paper restoration processes with antifungal activity as an added benefit. With azoles remaining in the paper after the process, simultaneous repair and biotic protection in treated documents could be facilitated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Private and public archives harbor myriads of historic paper documents as an invaluable treasure of cultural heritage. Numerous library, archive and museum communities around the globe have committed to the task of preserving and&#8211;if necessary&#8211;restoring these documents to prevent additional deterioration.</p>
<p>A large share of paper wear is caused by endogenous abiotic factors, with acidic hydrolysis as a major cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref001">1</xref>]. The use of acidic sizing components and pulping processes, such as the bisulfite process, which were particularly popular throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, left paper in an acidic state and prone to slow auto-hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref002">2</xref>]. Furthermore, oxidization of lignin components creates further acidification and hence contributes to progression of paper brittleness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref003">3</xref>]. As a result, industrial mass de-acidification of paper-based documents has become an important business with several players involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref005">5</xref>]. Current paper standards promoted by library, archive &amp; museum communities, encompassing endogenous alkaline reserves and lignin contents below 1%, may have reduced the risk of acidic auto-hydrolysis, but today&#8217;s paper remains exposed to a variety of other risk factors, warranting further research in preservation and restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>In parallel to endogenous risks, the control of exogenous factors is an important countermeasure in paper preservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref006">6</xref>]. Exogenous abiotic factors, such as humidity and temperature for example, not only affect abiotic deterioration processes, but also facilitate microbial attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref007">7</xref>]. In a recent survey among 57 institutional participants from 20 different countries, Sequeira <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref008">8</xref>] have found that 79% of the participants had to deal with fungal infestations even though common preventative measures against fungal deterioration had been undertaken. According to the authors, most of these infestations were caused by unforeseen water contact (floods, leakage, fire suppression, outdoor humidity) or failure of (micro-)climate control systems, illustrating the importance of this issue beyond (sub-)tropical areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref001">1</xref>]. Extensive literature on deterioration-causing microorganisms, especially fungal isolates from libraries and archives, is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref006">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref011">11</xref>]. For example, <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic>, <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum</italic> as well as other species of the respective genera were isolated from and identified as causative for dark stains in historic documents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref008">8</xref>]. Species such as <italic>Aspergillus versicolor</italic> (among <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species) in addition to a diverse set of <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species were also reported to be ubiquitously found in archives, museums and libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref011">11</xref>]. The scientific literature also illustrates a continuous effort in preventing and controlling fungal deterioration of paper-based documents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref012">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref017">17</xref>], underlining the significant threat for cellulosic documents imposed by fungi.</p>
<p>As identified in a survey by Sequeira <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref016">16</xref>], available antifungal options are not yet satisfactory&#8211;especially since no high-throughput treatments for removal or prevention of fungal infestations on cellulosic documents are available to date. A novel approach, however, promises a potential for integration of antifungal components in paper documents in a combined industrial de-acidification and mechanical paper reinforcement process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref005">5</xref>]. In this process, regenerated cellulose fibers are solubilized in an ionic liquid (IL) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a co-solvent, before applying the solution to cellulosic documents in an immersion bath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219650.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Upon solvent exchange with hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO), the cellulose fibers precipitate at the cellulosic surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref019">19</xref>], thereby conferring mechanical reinforcement with neglectable impairment of readability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref005">5</xref>]. Notably, residues of (co-)solvents and the IL used for cellulose solubilization get incorporated in the paper material along the way.</p>

Cellulose fibers are solubilized in IL (green triangles) and DMSO (orange circles) as co-solvent (left). Upon solvent exchange with HMDSO (blue circles; arrows indicate solvent replacement), cellulose fibers precipitate at cellulosic surfaces, thereby adding mechanical strength to the cellulosic documents while incorporating IL molecules (and other co-solvents).</p>

<p>ILs, also commonly referred to as liquid salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref020">20</xref>], consist of an organic cation or anion with an asymmetrical charge distribution (which is usually aprotic and stably charged in its nature) and a matching organic or inorganic counter ion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref021">21</xref>]. ILs are mostly recognized as high potential solvents in green chemistry applications due to their non-volatile characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref022">22</xref>]. Interestingly, the class of ionic liquid used in the paper reinforcement process (represented by 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium-acetate; BA) shares key structural characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219650.g002">Fig 2</xref>) with well-known antifungal agents such as Clotrimazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref023">23</xref>] or Miconazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref024">24</xref>]. Similarities comprise a charged, polar imidazolium group, which is known to be involved in blocking of an enzyme in ergosterol biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref026">26</xref>], as well as a nonpolar (derivatized) aliphatic molecule tail, believed to interact with fungal membranes and thereby disturbing their integrity at higher concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref027">27</xref>]. Extrapolating these findings, ILs of this class could potentially confer antifungal properties to documents treated in the aforementioned paper reinforcement process upon incorporation into the cellulosic documents. In this study, we therefore tested four ILs matching these characteristics and showing promising process compatibility properties for their antifungal potential. We could show in bioassays that BA and HC (1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium-chloride; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219650.g002">Fig 2</xref>) abolished growth of all tested fungi at 10% and 1% volume concentrations, respectively. Furthermore, fungal growth was significantly impaired at lower concentrations of 1% and 0.1%, respectively. While antifungal properties could not be confirmed on BA-treated paper samples, this study nevertheless provides important guidelines for future IL selection for incorporation of fungal protection in paper restoration.</p>

<title>Agar-based assays for antifungal IL activity and potency determination</title>
<p>Fungal spores were densely plated onto MM-CMC agar plates at a density of 10<sup>5</sup> spores per cm<sup>2</sup>. Wells were punched into the inoculated agar to locally apply 20 &#956;l of each IL. Plates were incubated at RT under light for germination and evaluated for halo formation and stability after four, seven, 14 and 28 days. Clotrimazole (in DMSO) was applied at 10,000 fold lower concentration as a positive, DMSO as a negative control. For potency evaluation, equimolar amounts of 140 &#956;mol of each IL as well as an aqueous dilution series thereof (75%, 50%, 25% and 10%) were spotted onto inoculated plates prepared as above in duplicates. Matching molar amounts of sodium chloride and sodium acetate were also tested for fungal growth impairment in this assay to exclude specific effects of the IL counter ions. Halo radii were measured fourfold after 14 days and plotted against the applied amount of IL. For microtiter scale experiments, the outermost wells of the plate were filled with 200 &#956;l sterile water to provide a humidity reservoir. MM-CMC was supplemented with varying volume per volume percentages of each IL (10%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, 0%), respectively. Three wells per IL and dilution step were prepared with 200 &#956;l medium per plate. Upon Inoculation of each well with 10<sup>4</sup> spores, plates were covered with a standard microtiter plate coverlid with or without aeration spacers, incubated at room temperature under light and evaluated for growth after four, seven and fourteen days.</p>

<title>Calculation of IL content in paper samples via elemental analysis of nitrogen (N)</title>
<p>Determination of the IL-content of paper treated in the reinforcement process was carried out via elemental analysis aiming at total nitrogen quantification after complete combustion. The analyses were performed on a CHN-O Rapid Elemental Analyser (Heraeus). An increase of 0.86 basis points in nitrogen content of treated compared to untreated paper was determined. Neither of the co-solvents DMSO or HMDSO contains nitrogen, and the overall nitrogen content of viscose fibers (Kelheim fibers GmbH) applied in the paper reinforcement process was assumed to be in a comparable (if not even lower) range compared with the original cellulosic document. Considering the nitrogen mass content of BA being 14.14%, this results in an estimated IL content of 6.1% in treated paper.</p>

<p>Quantification of fungal growth impairment by equimolar amounts of each of the four ILs was conducted for comparison of the four ILs via measurement of growth-free halo sizes on inoculated agar plates. Representative results are displayed for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>glabrum</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219650.g003">Fig 3c and 3d</xref>.

Notably, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>globosum</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>capillare</italic> revealed even stronger susceptibility to HC and BA than <italic>P</italic>. <italic>glabrum</italic>, which levelled equal to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>versicolor</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>chrysogenum</italic> in terms of susceptibility to the tested ILs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219650.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Halos were observed to be stable and not penetrated by adjacent hyphae throughout 28 days of incubation. Halo formation was not observed on plates inoculated with corresponding molar amounts of sodium chloride or sodium acetate, indicating that the different counter ions (or the ionic strength, respectively) of the tested ILs did not facilitate growth impairment or inhibition <italic>per se</italic>.</p>
<p>As an important measure with regard to the paper reinforcement process, antifungal activities of the tested ILs would best be assessed as minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in volume percentages. For this, a miniaturized growth assay was developed that allowed assessment of MIC and minimal growth impairing concentration (MGIC). MM-CMC with varying IL concentrations was inoculated with fungal spores in microtiter plate wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219650.g003">Fig 3e and 3f</xref>). All ILs but BC caused clear inhibition of growth at 10% (v/v) concentration, while BC could only mildly impair but not abolish growth at 10% in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>chrysogenum</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>glabrum</italic>. Apart from HC, which caused strong growth impairment and reduced sporulation already at the 1% concentration level in all tested fungi (and even completely inhibited germination of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>capillare</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>glabrum</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>globosum</italic>), only BA was observed to show mild growth and sporulation impairment at the 1% concentration level in some of the tested fungi, especially in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>capillare</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>globosum</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219650.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In summary, BA and especially HC were determined to have the highest antifungal potential.</p>

<title>Testing fungal growth on IL-treated <italic>vs</italic>. non-treated paper as carbon source</title>
<p>Elemental analysis revealed an IL content of about 6.1% (w/w) in treated paper (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). With an observed MIC value of around 1% for HC and MGIC of 1% for BA, antifungal effects should therefore, in principle, be observable in incubation experiments of fungal spores on BA- and HC-treated paper samples. Since AC and HC had shown poor cellulose solubilizing properties, the paper reinforcement process could only be established with BC and BA in pilot scale so far.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We were able to demonstrate that all tested ILs exhibited growth-inhibiting effects on relevant paper-deteriorating molds at high concentrations of 10% in an agar-based assay, while BC could only impair growth of the two <italic>Penicillia</italic> under these conditions. Potency experiments considering halo sizes on IL-inoculated agar plates and determining minimal inhibiting concentrations (MIC) as well as minimal growth impairment concentrations (MGIC) further revealed HC to be the strongest antifungal substance of the tested set, followed by BA, AC and BC. Detailed evaluation of the IL effects revealed that the order of their respective potency matches well with the size of their corresponding non-polar group, which is pointing towards the importance of the hydrophobic region for antifungal activity. Similar results were observed when the membrane-disturbing effects of three antifungal imidazolium drugs were tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref027">27</xref>], indicating that larger nonpolar groups may facilitate stronger membrane interactions and hence better antifungal activities in imidazolium-containing ILs. A systematic study focusing purely on the dependency of the antifungal effect on non-polar group sizes and structures would likely help to elucidate this correlation further.</p>
<p>Our study also allowed for hypothesis generation on antifungal effects of IL characteristics beyond the non-polar group constitution. Remarkably, the two ILs BA and BC only differ in their respective counter ions acetate and chloride, which by themselves were shown not to impair or inhibit fungal growth at equivalent concentrations in this study. It remains unclear, however, why the antifungal activity of BA was quite prominent while that of BC was very poor. Literature on plant cuticular membrane penetration of glyphosate salts for example indicates that the nature of the counter ion indeed influences the membrane penetration characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref038">38</xref>]. Fungal cell membrane penetration would be a crucial prerequisite for inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis as a proposed mode of antifungal action of imidazolium ILs similar to that described for established imidazolium antifungals such as Clotrimazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0219650.ref026">26</xref>]. Additional research should address the influence of different counter ions in imidazolium ILs on antifungal activity, which could further benefit the development of highly potent antifungal drugs.</p>
<p>Considering an application as an antifungal component in paper restoration, the persistence of growth-free halos around IL inoculation sites throughout the observation period of four weeks indicated long-term stability and inertness of the tested ILs towards fungal decay or abiotic factors, which would be a beneficial trait for archived documents. However, while strong growth impairment was observed for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>capillare</italic> on MM-CMC containing 1% (v/v) of BA, no such growth impairment could be observed on BA-treated paper&#8211;which was found to contain about 6% (w/w) of BA in elemental analysis. Moreover, replacing the agar plates with a high-humidity chamber, as a precaution to avoid the potential dilution of the effective IL concentration from the paper samples, did not result in perceptible growth differences. Although the actual cause for the absence of growth impairment on BA-treated paper could not finally be assessed in this study, we hypothesize that the IL might be trapped inside the adsorbed cellulose fibers, rendering it poorly available for the fungus. Effective IL amounts released during fungal enzymatic cellulose degradation might thus be too low to cause notable growth impairment. However, further studies need to be conducted to examine this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Apart from IL characteristics like non-polar group size and the type of counter ion identified in this study as potential optimization targets for further studies on antifungal IL activity, we also recommend the consideration of adapted strategies to implement antifungals in mechanical paper restoration. For example, the antifungal drug Clotrimazole&#8211;which is structurally highly related to the tested ILs&#8211;displayed more than 1000 times higher activity compared to HC, the most potent IL tested in this study. However, Clotrimazole and related known antifungal compounds alone are not suitable for substitution of the cellulose-solubilizing ILs in the industrial process. Additional application designs should therefore also evaluate the possibility of applying highly potent antifungals as additional additives in the established organic solvent-based mechanical restoration processes to deliver them to the cellulosic material alongside the fiber repair processes.</p>
<p>Altogether, by demonstrating a general antifungal potential of ILs and identifying initial chemical parameters that appear to affect their activity, this study can serve as a guidance to focus ongoing research on the integration of biotic preservation substances into mechanical restoration processes for cellulosic documents&#8211;and hence contribute to biotic preservation of cultural heritage.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript presented by Schmitz entitled " Preserving cultural heritage: Analyzing the antifungal</p>
<p>potential of ionic liquids tested in paper restoration " can be accepted after clarification of the following points:</p>
<p>1. The experiments are performed taking DMSO as the medium which itself shows zwiterionic properties and bear a appreciable value of polarity. So inorder to understand the effects of the planted Ionic liquids, other solvent mediums like ethanol, acetone, ethers may be done in presence of ionic liquids. Also blank tests in these solvents have to be done and reported with comparisons with DMSO.</p>
<p>2. The authors have presented a model of the spatial orientation of the ionic liquid, solvent on cellular fibres on paper in Fig.2. The logical design may be explained clearly.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Paper is good and very much applied aspects. It definitely, open a new area of research in the field of conservation work. But, personally, I feel if there is scope for modification, specially in discussion section.</p>

<p>To the editor:</p>
<p>We have made the amended formal changes and included required statements in the Funding and Competing Interest sections as requested (Editor Requests 1-3).</p>
<p>------------------</p>
<p>To the reviewers:</p>
<p>We would like to gratefully thank you for your kind appreciation of our work and for your critical review of our article "Preserving cultural heritage: Analyzing the antifungal potential of ionic liquids tested in paper restoration". We value your constructive remarks and would like to respond to them point-by-point in the following:</p>
<p>To reviewer #1:</p>
<p>"The manuscript presented by Schmitz entitled "Preserving cultural heritage: Analyzing the antifungal potential of ionic liquids tested in paper restoration" can be accepted after clarification of the following points:</p>
<p>1. The experiments are performed taking DMSO as the medium which itself shows zwitterionic properties and bear a appreciable value of polarity. So in order to understand the effects of the planted Ionic liquids, other solvent mediums like ethanol, acetone, ethers may be done in presence of ionic liquids. Also blank tests in these solvents have to be done and reported with comparisons with DMSO."</p>
<p>Answer: We highly appreciate your constructive suggestions. However, as the original process, in which our ILs are applied, involves initial solubilization and subsequent precipitation of cellulose onto printed document surfaces, we are tightly limited in terms of the solvents we can use. Ethanol and acetone, for example, do not facilitate solubilization of cellulose fibers and strongly impair legibility of the treated documents due solubilization of the ink. We would also like to clarify that DMSO was only used as a solvent for Clotrimazole and 1-Butyl-3-Methylimidazolium chloride (both solid at room temperature), while the other ionic liquids were applied as pure liquids (without the need for additional solvents during potency assessment in this study). In order to clarify the methodological sequence for the reader, we made some amendments in the methods section. Moreover, a blank test of the antifungal activity of DMSO had already been included in the initial antifungal activity screening (Figure 3 A, B). Overall, we therefore do not think that additional tests with further solvents would give relevant results that could actually be used in the process.</p>
<p>"2. The authors have presented a model of the spatial orientation of the ionic liquid, solvent on cellular fibers on paper in Fig.2. The logical design may be explained clearly."</p>
<p>Answer: We believe that the reviewer is actually referring to Figure 1 and &#8211; after reconsideration - agree with the reviewer that the initial illustration was partially misleading in terms of how the ionic liquid and DMSO entities were positioned. We have therefore now adapted the figure including its figure legend accordingly. We believe that the figure is now more accurately representing the process.</p>
<p>To reviewer #2: </p>
<p>Paper is good and very much applied aspects. It definitely open a new area of research in the field of conservation work. But, personally, I feel if there is scope for modification, especially in discussion section."</p>
<p>Answer: We have gladly modified the discussion section and hope to have improved it by doing so. Firstly, we have re-arranged the discussion paragraphs to better mirror the presentation sequence of the results. We believe that this allows a better orientation for the reader and hence could benefit the level of comprehensiveness. </p>
<p>We have rearranged the last bit of the first paragraph (i) to bring the sections discussing the correlation of IL potency and IL structure closer together in the text and (ii) to be able to discuss the long-term stability of the antifungal activity in the broader context of the paper-based application.</p>
<p>We furthermore included a statement in the second paragraph that points out the necessity for further studies on the contribution of non-polar group size and structure to the respective antifungal activity of an ionic liquid &#8211; as was done in the third paragraph as well. </p>
<p>Lastly, we extended the second-to-last paragraph. We aimed at putting stronger emphasis on the proposed future directions for research on biotic preservation implementation in paper restoration processes. </p>
<p>Additional minor modifications were made to improve overall readability and to clarify certain statements.</p>
