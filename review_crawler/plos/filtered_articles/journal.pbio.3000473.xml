<abstract>
<p>Intracellular malaria parasites grow in a vacuole delimited by the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM). This membrane fulfils critical roles for survival of the parasite in its intracellular niche such as in protein export and nutrient acquisition. Using a conditional knockout (KO), we here demonstrate that the abundant integral PVM protein exported protein 1 (EXP1) is essential for parasite survival but that this is independent of its previously postulated function as a glutathione S-transferase (GST). Patch-clamp experiments indicated that EXP1 is critical for the nutrient-permeable channel activity at the PVM. Loss of EXP1 abolished the correct localisation of EXP2, a pore-forming protein required for the nutrient-permeable channel activity and protein export at the PVM. Unexpectedly, loss of EXP1 affected only the nutrient-permeable channel activity of the PVM but not protein export. Parasites with low levels of EXP1 became hypersensitive to low nutrient conditions, indicating that EXP1 indeed is needed for nutrient uptake and experimentally confirming the long-standing hypothesis that the channel activity measured at the PVM is required for parasite nutrient acquisition. Hence, EXP1 is specifically required for the functional expression of EXP2 as the nutrient-permeable channel and is critical for the metabolite supply of malaria parasites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria pathology results from the replication of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites in red blood cells (RBCs). Malaria parasites proliferate within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) surrounded by the membrane of the PV (PVM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref002">2</xref>], the interface between parasite and host cell. The PVM harbors protein complexes that serve key functions for the intracellular survival of the parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref001">1</xref>]. The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> translocon of exported proteins (PTEX) mediates the transport of parasite proteins across the PVM into the host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref005">5</xref>]. A nonselective pore permits passage of nutrients such as monosaccharides, folates, and amino acids through the PVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref007">7</xref>]. While the composition and function of PTEX has been studied in some detail, the molecular basis for the nutrient-permeable channel activity is much less defined. PTEX comprises oligomers of 3 core components, including exported protein 2 (EXP2), which forms a heptameric PVM-spanning channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref008">8</xref>]. Conditional knockdown and patch-clamp measurements indicated that EXP2 has a dual role in both protein export as part of PTEX and in the nutrient-permeable channel activity of the PVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref007">7</xref>], a conclusion initially indicated by the homology and complementation capacity of EXP2 to 2 proteins required for the solute pore activity in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Other PVM proteins include highly expressed single-pass transmembrane (TM) proteins such as early transcribed membrane proteins (ETRAMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref010">10</xref>] and exported protein 1 (EXP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref011">11</xref>]. EXP1 was the first protein localized to the PVM of blood and liver stages where it forms homo-oligomers with the N-terminus facing the PV lumen and the C-terminus exposed to the RBC cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref013">13</xref>]. Unsuccessful attempts to genetically disrupt <italic>exp1</italic> suggested an essential role for EXP1 in parasite development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Bioinformatic analyses classified EXP1 as a member of the superfamily of membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref016">16</xref>]. Enzymatic in vitro assays indicated that EXP1 possesses glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, and it was proposed to protect the parasite from oxidative damage via detoxification of hemoglobin byproducts by conjugation with reduced glutathione (GSH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref016">16</xref>]. It was further proposed that EXP1 is associated with artemisinin (ART) resistance, as its transcription was up-regulated in ART-resistant parasite strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref016">16</xref>]. A study in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> indicated that EXP1 may also play a role in the uptake of lipids during intrahepatic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, using a conditional knockout (KO) of <italic>exp1</italic>, we show that EXP1 is essential for the growth of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> blood stages independently of the previously proposed GST activity. We find that EXP1 is required for the nutrient-permeable channel activity of the PVM. Consistently, parasites with reduced levels of EXP1 became hypersensitive to nutrient-limiting conditions, associating the permeability measured at the PVM with nutrient acquisition. EXP1 interacts with EXP2 at the PVM and is required for EXP2&#8217;s proper distribution and function as a nutrient-permeable channel but not for the function of EXP2 in protein export. Hence, EXP1 defines the function of EXP2 as a nutrient-permeable channel and is critical for nutrient uptake across the PVM, which now can be specifically studied.</p>

The endogenous <italic>exp1</italic> was disrupted before the region encoding the TM domain, and at the same time, a second functional copy of <italic>exp1</italic> flanked by loxP sites was introduced in the <italic>exp1</italic> locus. The new floxed copy of EXP1 is hemagglutinin (HA) tagged and can be conditionally excised by DiCre upon addition of rapalog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>).

<p>To investigate the effect of the loss of EXP1 on parasite survival, synchronous cond&#916;EXP1 ring-stage parasites were grown in the presence of rapalog, alongside a control culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). PCR confirmed efficient excision of the functional copy of <italic>exp1</italic> within one growth cycle (48 hours) upon addition of rapalog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). No growth defect was observed in this first cycle during which the <italic>exp1</italic> gene was excised (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). In this cycle, EXP1 protein levels remained at approximately 70% due to protein expressed in the PVM before excision was complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Western blot confirmed loss of EXP1 (approximately 5% residual protein detected at 48 h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) in parasites (henceforth termed &#916;EXP1 parasites) after invasion and start of a new cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, blue arrow). The &#916;EXP1 parasites failed to replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s001">S1C Fig</xref>), demonstrating that EXP1 is essential for propagation in RBC. The N-terminal fragment remaining after excision was nonfunctional as it does not rescue growth and was only detectable by IFA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s001">S1D Fig</xref>), likely because of its small size and possible low stability.</p>
<p>Giemsa smears taken in regular intervals from synchronous parasites showed that &#916;EXP1 ring stages were much slower to reach the trophozoite stage than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). &#916;EXP1 trophozoites often displayed protrusions reaching into the host cell cytoplasm (&#8220;blebs,&#8221; light blue arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) and frequently had an aberrant condensed morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). &#916;EXP1 trophozoites did not complete schizogony as evident by a significantly reduced number of nuclei per &#916;EXP1 parasite compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s001">S1E Fig</xref>) and by an almost complete absence of new rings in the next cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). To test whether very slowly growing &#916;EXP1 parasites persisted, we carried out an extended growth assay with the &#916;EXP1 parasites. These experiments revealed a resurfacing of parasites in the &#916;EXP1 culture grown in the presence of rapalog 9 days after loss of EXP1, but PCR identified this as a population with a nonexcised <italic>exp1</italic> locus. These parasites were therefore breakthroughs, further indicating that loss of EXP1 abolishes parasite propagation in RBCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s001">S1F Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To observe the phenotype of EXP1 loss in more detail, we compared the development of &#916;EXP1 parasites to controls, using long-term time-lapse imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref021">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). This confirmed a severe delay of the ring stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and a very slow development of trophozoites without completion of the cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Time-lapse imaging also revealed phenotypes in ring stages: &#916;EXP1 parasites changed position in the host cell less frequently and rarely showed amoeboid shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>), 2 typical features of ring stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref021">21</xref>] regularly observed in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>). In addition, &#916;EXP1 parasites were often found closely adjoined to the RBC membrane, a phenomenon that we here termed &#8220;hugging&#8221; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>, red arrowheads), also evident by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s001">S1G Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The protrusions observed in Giemsa smears were also visible in differential interference contrast (DIC) and also in &#916;EXP1 rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, light blue arrowheads). These &#8220;blebs&#8221; were bounded by PPM and present almost exclusively in &#916;EXP1 parasites as confirmed with a parasite plasma membrane (PPM) marker (Lyn-mCherry) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref022">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). The total number of membrane-bounded protrusions detected using in Bodipy-TR-ceramide or Lyso-PC was also mildly enriched in &#916;EXP1 parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g002">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s001">S1H Fig</xref>). Despite these morphological alterations, the PVM integrity in &#916;EXP1 parasites was not compromised, because a soluble PV marker (SP-mScarlet) was retained in the PV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s001">S1I Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we evaluated the impact of EXP1 loss on gametocytogenesis. Interestingly, we detected stage III&#8211;V gametocytes lacking EXP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), although the number of late-stage gametocytes was reduced by more than 50% 8 days after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Nevertheless, this indicated a lower effect of loss of EXP1 on the development of gametocytes than on asexual blood stages.</p>

<title>All regions of EXP1 are important for its function</title>
<p>To confirm that the observed growth phenotype is specific for EXP1 loss, we complemented the cond&#916;EXP1 parasites with a Ty-tagged full-length copy of EXP1 (EXP1wt-Ty) expressed under the constitutive <italic>nmd3</italic> promoter. EXP1wt-Ty was correctly located at the PVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and, after removal of the endogenous EXP1, restored parasite growth to 80% of the unexcised control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s002">S2A&#8211;S2C Fig</xref>).

The complemented parasites also showed a similar duration of the ring stage compared to the wild type, indicating that the delay to reach the trophozoite was reverted by the complementation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s002">S2D Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To pinpoint the functional regions in EXP1, we tested a series of modified Ty-tagged EXP1 constructs for their capacity to complement loss of endogenous EXP1. Except for EXP1wt-mScarlet, all constructs were correctly inserted into the PVM, and deletions or replacements in the N- or C-terminus mostly led to severe loss of function (S2A-S2C and S3A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, EXP1 of the rodent malaria parasite <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> (<italic>Pb</italic>EXP1) only partially (46.1% &#177; 9.4% activity) rescued loss of EXP1 in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), indicating limited functional conservation between species. Deletion of the entire C-terminus of EXP1 reduced its activity to 59.37% &#177; 13.82% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). EXP1 lacking an 11 amino acid stretch (sequence SGVSSKKKNKK) in the N-terminus named E-domain (EXP1&#916;ED), a region proposed to be necessary for the dimerization based on similarity with MAPEGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref023">23</xref>], complemented only poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Previous work indicated that EXP1 homo-oligomerizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref012">12</xref>]. However, loss of function of EXP1&#916;ED was not due to profound alterations in its capacity to oligomerize, as dimers were still detectable after formaldehyde crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>We noticed that the TM domains of integral PVM proteins such as EXP1 and ETRAMPs in different malaria species are particularly rich in G, S, and T residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). G, S, and T are known to be important as TM interaction interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref025">25</xref>]. Strikingly, point mutations of the first glycine residues (from G to L) of the two GXXG motifs of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> EXP1 (<italic>Pf</italic>EXP1) TM abolished EXP1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) although the protein was still correctly trafficked (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>) and capable of dimerizing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Collectively, we conclude that all parts of EXP1 are required for its function.</p>

<title>EXP1 GST activity is dispensable for parasite growth</title>
<p>Previous work showed that recombinant EXP1 conjugates hematin to GSH in vitro and thereby may protect the parasite from heme-induced oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref016">16</xref>]. Based on homology with other MAPEGs, it was postulated that the catalytic center of the GST activity of EXP1 resides in 3 N-terminal residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Mutation of one of these residues (R70) led to a reduced enzymatic activity in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref016">16</xref>]. We used our complementation approach to assess the importance of these residues (and hence of the proposed GST activity) for parasite development. Constructs with mutations of 1 (EXP1R70A) or all 3 residues (EXP1-3xmut) of the proposed catalytic site showed 69.0% &#177; 9.2% and 62.5% &#177; 16.2% complementation activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), indicating that these mutations had only a moderate effect on EXP1 function compared to most other complementation constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). IFAs and solubility assays showed correct targeting of the complementation constructs to the PVM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). EXP1 R70A expressed under the stronger promoter resulted in nearly identical complementation capacity to the wild-type construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). These data indicate that if EXP1 is a MAPEG, its GST activity plays only a minor role for growth of blood stage parasites.</p>

<title>Loss of EXP1 is not associated with elevated oxidative stress</title>
<p>If EXP1 is a GST that protects from heme-induced oxidative damage, loss of its activity should lead to increase oxidative stress in the parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref016">16</xref>]. To test whether EXP1, irrespective of our complementation data, may act as a GST in the parasite, we measured the oxidative stress status in &#916;EXP1 and control age-matched trophozoites using the fluorescent reporter chloromethyl dihydrochloro fluorescein (CM<sub>2</sub>-DCFDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) to quantify intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROSs). Interestingly, the levels of fluorescence in &#916;EXP1 parasites were not significantly different from those of control parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>), suggesting that &#916;EXP1 parasites are not under elevated oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Consistently, &#916;EXP1 parasites were not rescued in the presence of antioxidants (Trolox, ascorbic acid) and glutathione precursors (N-acetylcysteine and cysteine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Growth of parasites complemented with limiting amounts of EXP1 (EXP1wt<sup>low</sup>) was also not ameliorated in the presence of any of the supplements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Overall, these data indicate that the growth defect of &#916;EXP1 parasites is not caused by elevated oxidative stress and reduction of oxidative damage does not rescue loss of EXP1.</p>
<p>The oxidative insult generated by hemoglobin byproducts can be diminished by inhibiting hemoglobin digestion with the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref027">27</xref>]. If EXP1 is involved in protecting the parasites from heme-mediated oxidative damage as proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref016">16</xref>], growth of &#916;EXP1 parasites should improve after inhibiting hemoglobin degradation. To test this, we treated ring stages expressing limiting amounts of EXP1 (EXP1wt<sup>low</sup>) with E64 (before start of hemoglobin ingestion) and removed the inhibitor 12 hours later. Efficient inhibition of hemoglobin degradation was evident by swollen food vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, arrowheads). However, E64 treatment did not restore growth of these parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). To confirm that E64 can protect against oxidative stress, we treated these parasites with dihydroartemisinin (DHA). While E64 ameliorated the effect of DHA as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref029">29</xref>], E64 did not improve the growth defect of parasites expressing limiting levels of EXP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Hence, the growth of parasites with reduced levels of EXP1 was not ameliorated by lower levels of hemoglobin-byproduct&#8211;induced oxidative stress, indicating that the proposed detoxification of hemoglobin metabolites is not a major function of EXP1.</p>

<title>EXP1 does not influence ART resistance</title>
<p>EXP1 was proposed to be involved in ART resistance by conjugating ART to GSH and thereby lowering oxidative damage. ART resistance was also associated with up-regulation of EXP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref016">16</xref>]. We exploited our conditional &#916;EXP1 parasites to determine whether the expression levels of EXP1 influence the susceptibility of the parasites to DHA. The levels of EXP1 in the parasites used for these experiments ranged from very low and growth limiting (EXP1wt<sup>low</sup> in &#916;EXP1 parasites) to overexpression (EXP1wt<sup>high</sup> on top of the endogenous EXP1-HA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g003">Fig 3B&#8211;3D</xref>). Determination of the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for DHA showed no significant difference between these cell lines after removal of the endogenous EXP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). Naturally occurring ART resistance can only be measured using ring-stage survival assays (RSAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref030">30</xref>]. To detect lower levels of resistance, we used a lower than usual concentration of DHA (350 nM). While a previously established DHA-resistant line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref020">20</xref>] displayed reduced susceptibility to DHA in the RSA, the parasites expressing higher levels of EXP1 than wild type displayed no better survival than parasites expressing limiting levels of EXP1 or the GST catalytic site mutant EXP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4I</xref>), indicating that EXP1 levels did not affect ART responsiveness.</p>

<title>The nutrient-permeable channel activity but not PTEX function is defective in &#916;EXP1 parasites</title>
<p>As the previously postulated function as a heme-detoxifying GST did not appear to be responsible for the phenotype in &#916;EXP1 parasites, we looked for other possible functions of EXP1. In previous work, we identified EXP1 in immunoprecipitations (IPs) of EXP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref031">31</xref>]. Therefore, EXP1 might be involved in functions attributed to EXP2, either protein export or the nutrient-permeable channel activity at the PVM. First, we tested whether ablation of EXP1 affects protein export. &#916;EXP1 parasites showed no defect in the export of skeleton binding protein 1 (SBP1), ring exported protein 1 (REX1), REX2 (early-stage exported), and knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) and MSP7-related protein 6 (MSRP6) (late-stage exported) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s004">S4C Fig</xref>).

<p>To test whether EXP1 affects the nutrient-permeable channel activity at the PVM, patch-clamp measurements were performed on the PVM of &#916;EXP1 parasites liberated from their host cell. After liberation, the PVM remained intact, as evidenced by the retention of a co-expressed soluble PV marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s001">S1I Fig</xref>). The PVM of the liberated parasites was now accessible to a patch-clamp pipette. After giga-seal formation, each individual sample was inspected for channel activity, defined as a current flicker from closing channels at 30 mV applied voltage to the patch pipette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref007">7</xref>]. While channel activity was often immediately apparent in the control sample, channel activity was mostly absent in the &#916;EXP1 parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g005">Fig 5D</xref> left). The frequency to detect at least one channel at the PVM (f<sub>chan</sub>) of &#916;EXP1 parasites was significantly reduced compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g005">Fig 5D</xref> right). Together, these results demonstrate that EXP1 is important for the nutrient-permeable channel activity at the PVM but not for protein export.</p>

<title>Loss of EXP1 alters the distribution of EXP2, and both proteins interact at the PVM</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of EXP1 loss on EXP2 localization as a possible reason for the reduction of nutrient-permeable channel activity, we expressed a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of EXP2 (EXP2GFP) in cond&#916;EXP1 parasites. No differences were obvious between controls and &#916;EXP1 ring stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). However, at the beginning of the trophozoite stage, EXP2-GFP displayed a profoundly altered distribution in 75% of the &#916;EXP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g006">Fig 6A&#8211;6C</xref>) as evident by the concentration of EXP2 in small regions of the PVM, frequently in loop-like Bodipy-TR-ceramide positive protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g006">Fig 6A and 6C</xref>).

<p>The distribution of other PVM proteins such as early (ETRAMP10.1) or later (ETRAMP4) integral PVM markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref010">10</xref>] showed no apparent differences in &#916;EXP1 parasites compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g006">Fig 6F and 6G</xref>). In contrast, ETRAMP5 accumulated in small regions of the PVM where it colocalized with the aberrantly distributed EXP2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g006">Fig 6H</xref>). Interestingly, ETRAMP5 was previously found in co-IPs as a potential interaction partner of EXP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref031">31</xref>]. However, in contrast to EXP1, ETRAMP5 was dispensable for parasite growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) and may not be needed for an essential process such as the nutrient-permeable channel activity at the PVM.</p>
<p>As EXP1 influenced the distribution of EXP2, we tested whether this effect was reciprocal by knocking out EXP2. For this, we used the same strategy as for EXP1 to generate a conditional EXP2 KO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). As previously published, KO of EXP2 led to loss of protein export and arrested development at the trophozoite stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref032">32</xref>]. However, neither the distribution of EXP1-Ty expressed in these parasites nor that of endogenous ETRAMP5 was markedly altered in &#916;EXP2 parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g006">Fig 6I&#8211;6K</xref>). The minor effect observed on the distribution of EXP1 likely is due to the impact on parasite morphology in the EXP2 KO. Hence, the correct localization of EXP1 does not appear to depend on EXP2.</p>
<p>Prompted by the altered distribution of EXP2 in the &#916;EXP1 parasites, we performed co-IPs in crosslinked parasites to test whether the two proteins interact. IP of the endogenously HA-tagged EXP1 in cond&#916;EXP1 parasites expressing EXP2-GFP resulted in copurification of EXP2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g006">Fig 6L</xref>), while a soluble PV protein (serine-rich antigen 5 [SERA5]) and an integral PVM protein (ETRAMP4) were not co-immunoprecipitated. The reciprocal experiment by immunoprecipitating EXP2-GFP corroborated these findings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). Thus, EXP1 interacts with EXP2 at the PVM, suggesting that their activity may be linked. We also found EXP1 and EXP2 in structures within merozoites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s008">S8B Fig</xref>), in agreement with previous results showing that both proteins are stored in dense granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, we tested whether loss of EXP1 affected membrane association of EXP2. In the EXP1 KO parasites, EXP2 was still membrane associated as indicated by retention of the protein after lysing parasites with saponin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). Next, we carried out more detailed tests using carbonate and urea to solubilize peripheral membrane proteins. Previous work showed that a small fraction of EXP2 can be extracted with carbonate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref034">34</xref>]. This property was not changed after removal of EXP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s008">S8D Fig</xref>). While the extractability of EXP2 by urea appeared to be increased in the &#916;EXP1 parasites compared to the control, this was not significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s008">S8D Fig</xref>). This indicated that loss of EXP1 does not profoundly alter the membrane association of EXP2.</p>

<title>Levels of EXP1 influence the capacity of parasites to respond to amino acid starvation</title>
<p>Due to its additional role in protein export, knocking out EXP2 precludes specific analysis of the PVM nutrient-permeable channel function. In contrast, EXP1 loss only affected this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). In agreement with a role in nutrient uptake, the phenotype observed in the &#916;EXP1 parasites (condensed trophozoites, growth retardation, and blebbing) resembled starvation phenotypes caused by amino acid depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref035">35</xref>] and by the loss of the parasite surface anion channel (PSAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref037">37</xref>], the activity at the RBC membrane for uptake of nutrients from the serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref038">38</xref>]. To first confirm that the phenotype of &#916;EXP1 parasites was solely due to loss of the channel activity at the PVM, not at the RBC membrane, we assessed the uptake of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref039">39</xref>] into &#916;EXP1 infected RBCs, an indicator for PSAC activity. Uptake of 5-ALA into RBC infected with &#916;EXP1 trophozoites was not significantly different from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). The small trend for reduced uptake was likely due to the growth retardation of &#916;EXP1 parasites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000473.s008">S8E Fig</xref>). Thus, PSAC activity is not impaired in &#916;EXP1 parasites, and the starvation-like phenotype is caused by the loss of the nutrient permeability at the PVM.</p>

<p>To more specifically test the association of EXP1 with nutrient acquisition, we compared parasite growth in medium containing limiting concentrations of amino acids with parasites grown in complete medium in cell lines expressing different levels of EXP1. Interestingly, growth in limited medium mimicked the prolonged ring-phase phenotype observed in &#916;EXP1 parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). Furthermore, while all cell lines expressing physiological (or higher) levels of EXP1 tolerated the limiting medium over 2 growth cycles to a similar extent, the cell line expressing limiting levels (EXP1<sup>low</sup> on rapalog) was hypersensitive to low levels of amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). This hypersensitivity was specifically related to the lack of amino acids because its response to an unrelated growth inhibition (using sodium azide) was similar to the other cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). We conclude that EXP1 is critical for nutrient acquisition across the PVM and that the presence of the nutrient-permeable channel detected by patch clamping at the PVM correlates with nutrient uptake. Parasites relying only on EXP1 with the mutated catalytic site showed an intermediate sensitivity to the limited medium, indicating that the growth reduction in these parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) was also due to reduced nutrient acquisition with this version of EXP1, although there was no significant difference to the line expressing both, the mutated and the wild-type form of EXP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g007">Fig 7E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous work led to the proposal that EXP1 is a GST of the MAPEG family that detoxifies hemoglobin byproducts and thereby protects malaria parasites from oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref016">16</xref>]. Furthermore, this work indicated that through this GST function, EXP1 can protect the parasite from the action of ART and that EXP1 transcription levels were elevated in ART-resistant parasites. Here, we show that the postulated GST activity of EXP1 is largely dispensable for parasite survival and that EXP1 protein levels did not influence ART susceptibility. Inhibition of hemoglobin catabolism by a protease inhibitor or the supplementation with reducing agents to protect from oxidative damage did not improve parasite growth when EXP1 was absent or its expression levels were growth limiting. Hence, although EXP1 may have GST activity in vitro, overall, our data indicate that this activity is not critical for blood stage growth. MAPEGs are a highly diverse and widely distributed family of proteins involved in the detoxification of metabolites and in glutathione and lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref015">15</xref>]. It is possible that EXP1 derives from such proteins but has adopted other functions that are critical for parasite survival.</p>
<p>We here provide functional evidence for a different role of EXP1 that is important for parasite survival. Apicomplexan parasites require an external supply of nutrients that reach the parasite by passive diffusion through a nonselective pore of the PVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref006">6</xref>]. Our patch-clamp experiments indicate that EXP1 is essential for the activity of a nutrient-permeable channel in the PVM. Recently, a different PVM protein, EXP2, was shown to be needed for this activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref009">9</xref>]. EXP2 oligomers also form the membrane-spanning pore of PTEX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref008">8</xref>]. Hence, EXP2 is needed for both, the nutrient-permeable channel activity and for protein export, potentially as the pore of both activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref007">7</xref>]. In previous work, Gold and colleagues postulated that EXP2 is either part of a complex that mediates both protein transport and the nutrient-permeable channel function or that it is part of 2 molecularly distinct complexes, each serving only one of these functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref009">9</xref>]. Recent data showed that there is a large pool of EXP2 in trophozoites that is devoid of the PTEX component heat shock protein 101 (HSP101), lending support for the existence of 2 compositionally distinct EXP2 complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref007">7</xref>]. However, targeting EXP2 cannot functionally distinguish these complexes. We here found that knocking out <italic>exp1</italic> specifically affects the location of EXP2 in trophozoites and abolished the nutrient-permeable channel activity at the PVM but not protein export. We also show that EXP1 interacts with EXP2. Hence, EXP1 is a defining factor of this nutrient-permeable channel activity, likely through its interaction with EXP2 and by maintaining the correct localization of this protein. It is therefore likely that there are indeed 2 functionally and compositionally distinct pools of EXP2, one serving protein export (the PTEX complex) and one for the nutrient-permeable channel function (depending on EXP2 and EXP1).</p>
<p>In further agreement with a PTEX-independent pool of EXP2, expression of EXP2 peaks in trophozoites, not in rings like the other PTEX components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref034">34</xref>]. Interestingly, EXP1 has a very similar expression profile to EXP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref040">40</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g008">Fig 8A</xref>), congruent with a function together with the trophozoite expressed EXP2 in the nutrient-permeable channel activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Overall, this indicates that in rings, when protein export is a predominant requirement for the parasite, EXP2 exists foremost in PTEX. In trophozoites, when protein export is less important but nutrient acquisition for rapid growth is critical, most of EXP2 is needed together with EXP1 for nutrient uptake and derives from a pool expressed after production of PTEX. As the PTEX components (apart from EXP2) are not, or only poorly, expressed in trophozoites, residual PTEX complexes remaining from the ring stage are likely sufficient to accomplish the protein export needs in trophozoites. Hence, PTEX likely occupies only a minority of the EXP2 population in trophozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). This is supported by our finding that knocking out EXP1 specifically affected the location of EXP2 in trophozoites but not in rings. Overall, the current data support a model in which protein export and the nutrient-permeable channel function are accomplished by molecularly distinct complexes that share EXP2 and have reciprocal stage-specific expression peaks that temporally coincide with the needs of the respective parasite stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Transcript levels of EXP1, EXP2, and the PTEX components HSP101 and PTEX150 across the asexual intra-erythrocytic cycle. Values were obtained from a previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref040">40</xref>]. (B) Schematics of the PVM of wild-type (left) and &#916;EXP1 parasites (right) during the ring (upper panel) and trophozoite stage (lower panel). Depicted molecules are explained in the box. Note that early expressed EXP2 is in light green and late expressed EXP2 is in dark green. In wild-type rings, EXP2 is predominantly associated with PTEX components to promote protein export, a major function of this stage. Less EXP2 is in the nutrient-permeable channel complex that depends on EXP1 but does not contain other PTEX components. The proportion of the abundance of the two EXP2 complexes is reversed in the trophozoite stage when most of protein export has been completed but rapid parasite growth demands more nutrients. PTEX150 and HSP101 are not expressed in this stage, but PTEX translocons left over from the ring stage make up a minor proportion of EXP2 complexes to maintain protein export activity. The nutrient-permeable channel function of EXP2 is negatively affected by loss of EXP1 either through indirect effects (indicated as aggregated EXP2, left part of PVM enlargement of &#916;EXP1 KO) or a direct defect of the complex (&#8220;defective&#8221; nutrient-permeable channel, right part of &#916;EXP1 KO). EXP1, exported protein 1; FKBPM, fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads; h.p.i., hours post invasion; HSP101, heat shock protein 101; KO, knockout; PTEX, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> translocon of exported proteins; PVM, parasitophorous vacuolar membrane.</p>

</fig>
<p>How loss of EXP1 affects the function of the nutrient-permeable channel activity remains to be determined. One possibility is that EXP1 has a role as part of the nutrient pore structure, and its absence could directly lead to a defective channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Alternatively, EXP1 may have a more indirect role. In this respect, it is interesting to note that EXP1 and the topologically related ETRAMPs form oligomeric arrays in the PVM and were hypothesized to compartmentalize different activities of the PVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref012">12</xref>]. The mislocalization of EXP2 could indicate that the EXP1 KO leads to EXP2 aggregation or otherwise negatively affects a functionally relevant spatial distribution of this protein in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000473.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). This effect could be specific for EXP2, as suggested by our IP data and the fact that ETRAMP4 did not show an altered distribution in the PVM of &#916;EXP1 parasites. A more general effect on the state of PVM proteins cannot not be fully excluded. The EXP1 KO also affected the distribution of ETRAMP5 in the PVM. However, this could also mean that this ETRAMP is connected to EXP2 and EXP1. This possibility is supported by the fact that ETRAMP5 also appeared in the EXP2 interactome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref031">31</xref>] and shows a similar expression profile to EXP1 and EXP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref040">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, if this is the case, ETRAMP5 does not play a critical part, as we here show that it is not essential for growth of asexual blood stages.</p>
<p>Consistent with a function in nutrient uptake of the parasite, EXP1 loss resembled previously observed starvation phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref037">37</xref>], and EXP1 levels specifically influenced the capacity of parasites to grow in medium with low levels of amino acids. This supports a role of EXP1 in nutrient acquisition and indicates that the activity measured at the PVM indeed is critical for the parasite's nutrient supply. Such a role for EXP1 now allows us to specifically study the nutrient-permeable channel activity, independent from the protein export activity of EXP2.</p>
<p>We confirmed previous data that EXP1 and EXP2 are stored in merozoites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref034">34</xref>], indicating that not only PTEX but also the nutrient-permeable channel activity can be delivered to the PVM during invasion and thus be active in ring stages. This would allow access of nutrients to rings and would explain the delayed development of these stages in the EXP1 KO. Nevertheless, most &#916;EXP1 rings eventually reached the young trophozoite stage, likely reflecting the lower dependence on exogenous nutrients up to this stage. The resemblance of a nutrient starvation phenotype did not derive from a restricted nutrient access to the infected RBC but rather is consistent with a loss of the nutrient permeability at the PVM in agreement with our patch-clamp observations. It is also noteworthy that the effect of the EXP1 KO was less pronounced on gametocytes, which are less metabolically active during their later development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, EXP1 is critical for the replication of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> in RBC, but this is independent of its postulated heme-detoxifying membrane GST activity. Rather, the evidence presented in this study supports the thesis that EXP1 is required for the EXP2-based nutrient-permeable channel activity of the PVM. Accordingly, the activity measured by patch-clamp indeed is important for the access of metabolites needed for parasite replication. These data clearly show that the function of EXP2 for nutrient uptake is functionally distinct from its role in protein transport.</p>

<p>Fluorescence microscopy was done as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref046">46</xref>]. Parasites were incubated with 1 &#956;g/ml DAPI in culture medium for 10 minutes to stain nuclei and analyzed using a Zeiss Axioscope M1 equipped with a 100X/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. A Hamamatsu Orca C4742-95 and the Zeiss Axiovision software were used for collecting images. Images were processed with Corel PHOTO-PAINT X6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.coreldraw.com/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.coreldraw.com</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For counting of nuclei, &#916;EXP1 and control parasites were stained with 1 &#956;g/ml DAPI 36 to 44 hours post invasion (h.p.i.) in the second cycle on rapalog (&#916;EXP1 parasites), and the number of nuclei was counted by 2 different analysts blinded to the identity of the sample. To quantify the localization of EXP2-GFP after depletion of EXP1, 3 different analysts counted cells <italic>(N =</italic> 25) scoring the number of cells with typical PVM localization (uninterrupted GFP signal surrounding more than 50% of the parasite) or cells with an aberrant localization (uninterrupted GFP signal surrounding less than 50% of the circumference of the parasite). The distribution of endogenous EXP2 was similarly scored by one analyst using IFA samples.

<p>For time-lapse imaging, parasites were synchronized using 5% sorbitol, the culture was split into 2 dishes of which one received rapalog to 250 nM and a control without rapalog. After 48 hours, the resulting &#916;EXP1 and control parasites were coated onto the bottom of a sterile, uncoated, hydrophobic, high, 35 mm &#956;-Dish (Ibidi) subdivided in 4 chambers using culture grade 0.5 mg/ml concanavalin A (Sigma) dissolved in dH2O as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref046">46</xref>]. Briefly, the concanavalin A (Sigma) was added to the dish surface for 10 minutes at 37&#176;C, washed off using PBS, and the culture, resuspended in sterile PBS, was added and allowed to settle for 15 minutes, using the different chambers of the dish for &#916;EXP1 and control parasites. Nonbound cells were washed off using DPBS, and prewarmed phenol red-free culture medium was added to the dish. Cells were viewed at 37&#176;C using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope equipped with an Olympus Cellcubator. Using the multi-area time-lapse function of the Fluoview software and a motorized stage, at least 10 fields (containing 10&#8211;20 infected RBCs) were observed for each condition. Control and &#916;EXP1 parasites were imaged simultaneously in the different chambers of the same dish for a period of 76 hours, and images were collected with a 1-hour interval. Focus was maintained using the Olympus ZDC autofocus system. An Olympus 60x/1.35 plan S apo oil immersion lens and Fluoview software version 1.7b was used. Parameters for image collection were usually 4&#8211;8 &#956;s laser dwell time, 512 &#215; 512 dpi, 16&#8211;32 z-stacks (0.38 &#956;m step size), a zoom level of 3&#8211;5, and a 559 nm laser at 1%&#8211;5%. The time-lapse experiments were analyzed and processed in Imaris 7.7.2 (Bitplane). Image series were cropped with Image J (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://imagej.nih.gov.ij/" ns0:type="simple">https://imagej.nih.gov.ij/</ext-link>), and single images were processed in Corel Photo-Paint X6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.coreldraw.com/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.coreldraw.com</ext-link>).</p>
<p>To analyze the phenotype in ring stages of control and &#916;EXP1 parasites, individual ring stages were scored in Imaris at every hour of the time-lapse experiment for ameboid shape, shape change compared to previous time point, position change in the RBC (more than half a cell diameter compared to previous time point), and hugging (defined as close apposition of parasite to RBC periphery), and the frequency was calculated for the total of time intervals examined for a given cell.

<title>Flow cytometry growth assays and Giemsa stages</title>
<p>For flow cytometry (FC) growth curves, parasitemia was measured by FC and adjusted to 0.1%, and the parasites were divided in two 2-ml dishes (one with 250 nM and a control without rapalog). To follow the growth of the culture using Giemsa smears, the parasitemia was adjusted to 1%, and smears were collected after the intervals indicated. Medium was changed daily, and rapalog was added freshly every day. For the FC curves, the parasitemia was measured as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000473.ref020">20</xref>]: 20 &#956;l resuspended parasite culture was incubated with dihydroethidium (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) and Hoechst (Cheomdex, Switzerland) at a final concentration of 4.5 &#956;g/ml and 5 &#956;g/ml, respectively, in RPMI for 20 minutes at room temperature protected from light. Before measuring, the cells were fixed with RPMI containing 0.003% glutaraldehyde. For every sample, 100,000 events were recorded using aLSRII flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson), and parasitemia was determined with the FACS Diva software.</p>
<p>For measuring the capacity to complement &#916;EXP1 parasites, the growth of the cell lines with the complementation constructs was assayed over 5 days using the FC growth assay starting before excision of <italic>exp1</italic> (cycle 0). The parasitemia was adjusted to 0.1% and divided in two 2-ml dishes, one with 250 nM rapalog and a control without rapalog. The parasitemia at day 5 was compared to that of the control. At least 4 independent replicas were analyzed for each cell line. To calculate the complementation activity for each construct, the level of growth (parasitemia at day 5 rapalog-treated/growth at day 5 unexcised) was compared to the percentage of complementation of the EXP1wt<sup>mid</sup> complementation construct. Data were analyzed with Graph Pad Prism version 6.07 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.graphpad.com/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.graphpad.com</ext-link>) and presented as mean &#177; SD.</p>
<p>To assess growth in presence of reducing agents, 4-day FC growth assays were performed with matched synchronous ring stages starting with 0.1% parasitemia after one cycle &#177; rapalog (i.e., using parasites already starting without EXP1 and their matched controls). RPMI was supplemented with Trolox, ascorbic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and cysteine each at a final concentration of 100 &#956;M. Every day, the parasitemia was measured by FC, and fresh medium with supplements was added. For examination of the effect of E64 on growth of &#916;EXP1 parasites, ring synchronized parasites at a parasitemia of 1% after one cycle &#177; rapalog were grown overnight with and without 1 &#956;M E64 (Sigma). The next day, cultures were thoroughly washed to remove E64 and further cultured without the inhibitor. In parallel, the same procedure was carried out with the same cell culture after one cycle &#177; rapalog but pretreated with 1 &#956;M E64 for 2 hours prior to a pulse of 50 nM DHA (Adipogen, Switzerland). After 3 hours, DHA-treated cultures were washed extensively and further cultured without the drug. The parasitemia was measured each day for 72 hours. The survival rate was calculated as parasitemia of DHA treated or rapalog treated compared to parasitemia of the respective control &#177; E64.</p>
<p>To evaluate sensitivity to low nutrient conditions, synchronous ring stages after 1 cycle &#177; rapalog were grown in complete amino acid&#8211;restricted medium and complete RPMI medium or medium containing 75 &#956;M NaN<sub>3</sub> (Sigma). To obtain amino acid restricted RPMI medium, complete medium was added in a 1/20 dilution to glucose and amino acid&#8211;free RPMI medium 1640 (US Biological). This resulted in a final concentration of 6 mM glucose and 1:20 of the concentration of every amino acid found in standard RPMI complete. Parasitemia was measured after 2 growth cycles using FC (day 5). Relative growth was calculated as parasitemia in restricted medium and NaN<sub>3</sub> containing medium compared to parasitemia of respective control in complete medium without NaN<sub>3.</sub></p>
<p>To evaluate stage distribution of parasites in low amino acid concentration, synchronous ring stages of &#916;EXP1 complementation lines were grown for 40 hours with and without rapalog. For this, schizonts that had been grown &#177; rapalog were Percoll (GE Healthcare, Sweden) purified and allowed to invade while shaking at 37&#176;C at 750 rpm for 30 minutes in complete and amino acid&#8211;restricted medium and further cultured for 3 hours in the respective medium. Rings 0&#8211;3 h.p.i. were sorbitol synchronized, and the cultures were continued in the respective medium. Smears were collected after 18, 22, 26, and 30 h.p.i. Stages were counted microscopically, and percentage of ring and trophozoite (parasites containing a clear focus of hemozoin) stages was calculated for every time point.</p>

Briefly, the crude antiserum was diluted 1/10 in 1x TBS (20 mM TrisHCl [pH 7.0], 150 mM NaCl) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and twice passed over the resin containing recombinant crosslinked GST to deplete antibodies binding GST. The flow through was collected and passed through a column containing resin with the corresponding recombinant GST fusion protein crosslinked to it. The antibodies on the resin were washed once with TBS containing 0.1%Triton-X-100, 5 times with TBS, 2 times with 0.1x TBS, and once with 0.1x TBS containing 0.1% Triton-X-100. Thereafter, the bound antibodies were eluted 10 times with 1 ml 0.1 M Glycine (pH 2.5), which was collected in tubes containing 25 &#956;l of 1 M TrisHCl (pH 9.0). Dilutions of eluate 1 and 2 were used for all experiments. Animal handling and immunization at Eurogentec were carried out in accordance with good animal practices according to the Belgian national animal welfare regulations for Eurogentec SA, Seraing and approved by the ethics committee (CE/Sante/E/001) of the Centre d&#8217;Economie Rurale (CER Groupe, Marloie, Belgium).

<p>==================</p>
<p>INFORMATION REGARDING THE REPORTING CHECKLIST:</p>
<p>PLOS Biology is pleased to support the "minimum reporting standards in the life sciences" initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/9sm4x/" ns0:type="simple">https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/9sm4x/</ext-link>). This effort brings together a number of leading journals and reproducibility experts to develop minimum expectations for reporting information about Materials (including data and code), Design, Analysis and Reporting (MDAR) in published papers. We believe broad alignment on these standards will be to the benefit of authors, reviewers, journals and the wider research community and will help drive better practise in publishing reproducible research. </p>
<p>We are therefore participating in a community pilot involving a small number of life science journals to test the MDAR checklist. The checklist is intended to help authors, reviewers and editors adopt and implement the minimum reporting framework.  </p>
<p>IMPORTANT: We have chosen your manuscript to participate in this trial. The relevant documents can be located here:</p>

<p>Dear Dr Spielmann,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "EXP1 is critical for nutrient uptake across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane of malaria parasites" for consideration as a Research Article at PLOS Biology. Your manuscript has been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, an Academic Editor with relevant expertise, and by several independent reviewers.</p>
<p>As you will read from the reviews (below), all the reviewers agree that the study is very well done. Reviewers #2 and #3 mainly request minor changes to improve the clarity and accessibility of the work. Reviewer #1 does suggest some additional experimental analyses. We have discussed the reviewers with the Academic Editor and feel there is really only one main outstanding question that needs some addressing which Reviewer 1 asks for experimentally and Reviewer 3 poses a question about - if EXP2 has two roles, one as a nutrient channel and the other for protein export (both of which require EXP2 to be inserted into the membrane) and EXP1 is required for EXP2 to correctly localise, why then is there a nutrient uptake defect but not a protein export defect when EXP1 is knocked down? How do you propose protein export EXP2 localises to the membrane without EXP1 and what is different about the two forms of EXP2? Reviewer 1 has asked for a solubility assay to determine if there is a change in the solubility profile of EXP2 after EXP1 knockdown, which we feel is not an arduous experiment to validate that EXP1 is indeed critical for EXP2 inserting into the membrane (which is only shown by IFA) and to explain these results. Reviewer 3 has asked for an explanation for the role of EXP1 in proper localisation of EXP2. We believe the experiment may certainly help to address/resolve this question and would encourage it. Regarding the other experiments recommended by Reviewer 1 (Point 2 - pull downs with mutant forms of EXP1 to reveal which regions of this protein are important for interaction) - we acknowledge that these may be beyond the scope of this paper and will not consider it essential for publication. Additionally, Reviewer 2 asked for IFAs to analyse the localisation and fluorescent instensity of EXP1 during this time frame - once again, while welcome, we do not feel it is essential and will not insist on it for publication. Overall, we welcome resubmission of a revised manuscript that takes into account the reviewers' comments. </p>

<p>Review of &#8216;EXP1 is critical for nutrient uptake across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane of malaria parasites&#8217; by Mes&#233;n-Ram&#237;rez et al for PLoS Biology.</p>
<p>Overall Comments</p>
<p>This is a very interesting paper which incorporates an enormous amount of work and finally gives us insight into the crucial function of EXP1, an abundant Plasmodium protein. EXP1 was thought to be involved in resisting oxidative stress but probably has a more important function in helping intraerythrocytic parasite forms acquire nutrients across their enveloping vacuole membranes. </p>
<p>Major Comments</p>
<p>1. In Fig 1 the authors establish using a very clever selection linked integration system that loxP mediated deletion of most of the exp1 gene arrests development of parasite blood stages. Detailed phenotyping of the mutants follows indicating they progress very slowly through the cell cycle after exp1 deletion. The young ring stage EXP1 null parasites produce more PVM protrusions than normal and often &#8216;hug&#8217; the RBC surface. It was not clear to me if loss of exp1 is lethal for the parasite or do they continue to grow slowly? There is no real explanation of why the ring stage &#8710;EXP1 parasites appear abnormal and if this appearance can by reversed by complementation with the full-length wildtype EXP1. Is the deletion of the exp1 gene incomplete and do the wildtype parasites outgrow the exp1 mutants after a few cell cycles?</p>
<p>2. In Fig 2 loss of EXP1* is complemented with wildtype EXP1 proteins under different strength promoters as well as with mutant forms of the EXP1 protein. This establishes that the complementing form of EXP1 needs to be strongly expressed and that residues in the transmembrane domain and ED region are important for function. While this section is informative as to what parts of EXP1 are important for parasite growth no information is provided as to why. Given that EXP1 appears critical for EXP2 nutrient pore function, pulldowns with the mutant forms of EXP1 might reveal which regions of this protein are important for interaction with EXP2. </p>
<p>3. In Fig 3 the issue of whether or not EXP1 is important for protection of parasites from oxidative damage. This is because previous work reported that EXP1 was a glutathione S-transferase. The work presented here indicated that loss of EXP1 did not greatly sensitise the parasites to oxidative damage suggesting EXP1 possibly has another major function. The experiments are comprehensive and sufficiently cover the issue. </p>
<p>4.  In Fig 4 and S4 and it is shown the EXP1 null mutants can still export parasite proteins into the RBC compartment. Subsequent patch clamp analysis of the PVM indicates that current flow across the PVM is greatly reduced in the EXP1 null mutant. While I understand the basics of the Fig 4d what units are pA? Why does the rapalog scale show 0 pA and the control 35 pA? Was 0.2s the total measurement time or just the length of the scale bar beneath it?</p>
<p>5. In Fig 5 the localisation of EXP2 is examined in EXP1 null parasites and found to be aberrant being concentrated into PVM protrusions and bodies around the parasite. ETRAMP5 was similarly affected but not other ETRAMPs. The implication if this finding is that EXP2 requires EXP1 for an even localisation around the PVM and pulldown experiments indicate the two proteins interact. The result that EXP1 is required for EXP2 function is a curious finding for it would be expected to reduce both nutrient uptake as well as protein export since EXP2 forms both nutrient pores and the protein translocon pore of PTEX. Up until this EXP1 null result I would have presumed the heptameric EXP2 pore structure would be similar in both nutrient and translocon complexes but the EXP1 result suggests the nutrient pore is a distinct and possibly different structure. This could be explored by determining if EXP2 can form a membrane pore in EXP1 null parasites by determining if EXP2 is still membrane associated when EXP1 is absent (ie, does EXP2 become soluble without EXP1?). Also, does the EXP2 protein that is pulled down with EXP1 lack any association with the rest of PTEX?</p>
<p>6. In Fig 6 the growth of parasites was examined on nutrient limited media to show that this sensitised parasites to grow slowly particularly when EXP1 was deleted or expressed at a low level. Reduction of EXP1 expression appears to reduce the capacity of nutrients across the PVM particularly when nutrients are in limited supply. The minimal media appears to have reduced levels of amino acids but which amino acids? Only isoleucine is essential with the remaining amino acids being produced from haemoglobin breakdown. Was this experiment repeated with only isoleucine being limited?  Part C should have p values between important data pairs. In part E which columns are treated with azide versus no azide and which are minimal versus complete medium.  </p>
<p>Minor Comments.</p>
<p>7. Fig 1. Part K right. What are the band sizes of the Kb ladder? Maybe label as per part C. In part L right, what do the red boxes mean? Is &#8216;2A&#8217; in the gene diagram the same as T2A in the legend?</p>
<p>8. Indicate cell cycle number in Fig 1d and e.</p>
<p>9. Line 439 is &#8216;Light blue arrow heads show blebs.&#8217; in part E mean to be in part F? </p>
<p>10. Line 450 What gene is Lyn-Cherry?</p>
<p>11. In Fig 2A size bars are missing from the IFA panel.</p>
<p>12. What do the coloured boxes in 2D mean?</p>
<p>13. Line 569. I could not find Table S1.</p>

<p>Reviewer #2 (signs review as Markus Meissner): </p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this study the Spielmann group performs an extensive functional characterisation of PfEXP1. This protein has been described previously as essential for the asexual development of Plasmodium spp and multiple, potential roles, including involvement in artemisinin resistance, resistance to oxidative stress or interactions and uptake of host apolipoprotein have been suggested by others.</p>
<p>In this study, a conditional mutant for Exp1 was generated using the DiCre system, which allowed the authors to perform a very thorough and detailed analysis of the resulting phenotype, using a combination of very neat, cutting edge technologies. </p>
<p>Briefly the authors convincingly demonstrated that:</p>
<p>- Exp1 is essential and parasites fail to replicate in absence of Exp1</p>
<p>- A carefully performed complementation analysis demonstrates that full length Exp1 is required for its essential function. Interestingly, the analysis indicates that there is only poor functional conservation within apicomplexans, since Exp1 of P.berghei appears to complement poorly for PfExp1. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the previous hypothesis that EXP1 is crucial for protection against oxidative stress has been convincingly invalidated, since mutations in the GST-domain did not result in loss of complementation. Similarly, the previous suggestion that EXP1 is involved in artemisinin resistance was invalidated. </p>
<p>- Loss of GST activity results only in minor effects on parasite growth and EXP1-activity must be crucial for other functions.</p>
<p>- Using patch Clamp measurements, the authors convincingly show that Exp1 is essential for the function of the major nutrient permeable channel of P.falciparum, a major and important finding!</p>
<p>- EXP1 is required for &#8220;smooth&#8221; localisation of EXP2, but not for PTEX function itself</p>
<p>- EXP1 and EXP2 can interact</p>
<p>- EXP1 is required for nutrient uptake, but not PSAC activity at the RBC membrane</p>
<p>Own opinion:</p>
<p>This is a very careful and exhaustive analysis that should be the gold-standard for a proper characterisation of phenotypes. It leaves very little room for major criticism, since the authors took great care to perform many control experiments, so that the final conclusions are fully supported by the data. In fact, the authors provide so many data and controls that it would have been sufficient for a separate paper. </p>
<p>Most importantly, this study can be seen as a milestone in order to understand the dual function(s) and differential regulations of Exp1 and Exp2 in protein export and nutrient acquisition. It will also end speculations regarding additional functions/roles of Exp1 for drug resistance or resistance to oxidative stress. </p>
<p>There is no doubt that it will be of high interest to a broad readership.</p>
<p>My comments are relatively minor, since I didn&#8217;t find any data/conclusions that require additional experimental validation.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>- The floxed locus is myc- and HA-tagged. Did the author also use alpha-myc to check for expression of truncated construct?</p>
<p>- Fig.1c: The authors present WB and PCR of cultures induced with Rap. It seems there is no significant downregulation within the first 24h and Exp1 is fully lost during the second cycle. It would be helpful if the authors could also provide IFAs to analyse the localisation and fluorescent intensity of Exp1 during this time frame.</p>
<p>- The description of the figures in the text is sometimes confusing. For example in line 132 its mentioned: (Fig.1f, arrows). There are 4 differently coloured arrows in Fig.1f. Other examples throughout the manuscript. This should be thoroughly corrected in the revision.</p>
<p>- It is recommended that the authors describe some details of their patch-clamp method presented in figure 4 already in the result session for better understanding and flow of the manuscript.</p>
<p>- Figure 5 is slightly overloaded. The IFAs using antibodies for EXP2 (5d,e) can easily be moved to supplementary figures, since it shows the same as 5a,b</p>
<p>- In the discussion the authors should also consider recent results from other apicomplexan parasites, such as Gold et al., 2015, which are nicely supporting the data presented in this study.</p>

<p>Reviewer #3: </p>
<p>Review for submission of manuscript PBIOLOGY-D-19-01632R1</p>
<p>By Paolo Mes&#233;n-Ram&#237;rez, B&#228;rbel Bergmann, Thuy Tuyen Tran, Matthias Garten, Jan St&#228;cker, Isabel Naranjo-Prado, Katharina H&#246;hn, Joshua Zimmerberg, Tobias Spielmann</p>
<p>&#8220;EXP1 is critical for nutrient uptake across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane of malaria parasites&#8221;</p>
<p>Mes&#233;n-Ram&#237;rez et al. report their findings concerning the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane protein Exported protein-1 in the apicomplexan parasite P. falciparum causing malaria. They characterize its properties as a nutrient conducting trans-membrane channel and also its functional and physical association with Exported protein-2, another vacuolar membrane protein that functions as a protein-conducting channel in the vacuolar translocon PTEX but also serves as a nutrient-conducting transmembrane channel.</p>
<p>Because nutrient uptake is essential to parasite survival and its expansion inside the infected red blood cell, there is considerable interest in &#8220;channeling the vacuole&#8221; by characterizing these nutrient or protein &#8220;channels&#8221; to better understand parasite physiology. This type of studies potentially extends the number of drug-targets by identifying novel essential pathways, the so-called permeability pathways, and their molecular effectors to design much-needed new anti-malarial compounds. </p>
<p>The work shows that EXP1 is needed for nutrient uptake at the vacuolar membrane, required for proper vacuolar localization of the pore-forming protein conducting channel EXP2, a core subunit of EXP2 but also a nutrient permeable channel as demonstrated by Garten et al. in a previous study.</p>
<p>I think this is beautiful work in terms of cellular and molecular apicomplexan parasitology that significantly expands the current knowledge of the field. I have a few questions and objections that the Authors may want to address but I strongly support publication once these issues have been addressed.</p>
<p>Comments and questions.</p>
<p>Line 37. What do authors means by &#8220;major&#8221; in major integral PVM protein EXP1? It is unclear to me. Is it abundance?</p>
<p>Line 41. I would suggest saying &#8216;pore-forming protein&#8217; (rather than molecule)</p>
<p>Line 61. I would suggest being more precise &#8220;which forms a heptameric PVM-spanning channel&#8221;. It does not hurt.</p>
<p>Authors use conditional KO of the gene exp1 to show that the protein EXP1 is essential for propagation in RBCs. Ring stages are slow to reach the trophozoite stages and schizogony is interrupted. Thus the effects are quite drastic and remarkable. The pervasive effects of EXP1 KO even affect the gametocytes but to a lower extent. The cytology indicates the presence of what Authors call &#8216;blebs&#8217; protruding out of the PVM although the integrity of the PVM is not compromised it is obviously altered at the ultra-structural level. The methodology and analysis are extremely thorough and beautifully well illustrated in the figures.</p>
<p>Although I find the section describing the complementation (or lack of) of the cornucopia of chimeric EXP1 constructs tested by the Authors to probe the role of the different regions in protein functionality quite complex, it is remarkable work. I am glad the Authors included Supp Fig 2 otherwise it would be a nightmare to understand it.</p>
<p>Paragraph starting line 167.</p>
<p>Based on high-resolution crystallographic structures of membrane proteins (MP), GXXG motifs are known to be essential for very close TM helix to TM helix packing/contact interactions in MP structures (whether it is intramolecularly as shown in Aquaporins for example) or between molecules to favor tightly packed oligomers inside the bilayer. Unless I missed where it is described, what kind of point mutations did the Authors introduce in the two GXXG motifs.</p>
<p>Line 161-163. &#8220;EXP1 lacking a 10 amino acid stretch in the N-terminus named E-domain (EXP1&#916;ED), a region proposed to be necessary for the dimerization based on similarity with MAPEG complemented only poorly (Fig. 2b). However, EXP1&#916;ED was still capable to homo-dimerize (Fig. 2e), indicating that the loss of function was not related to the capacity to oligomerize.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fig 2e. What is the sequence of the so-called E &#8216;domain&#8217; or better said 10-aminoacid long protein segment? Why would &#916;ED deletions then seem to form more dimer as suggested on Fig. 2e ... if that band actually meaningful? As a membrane protein biochemist, It do not really know what to do with what the Authors show on Fig2e concerning dimerization of their constructs wtEXP1 compared to the TMmut and &#916;ED variants. Honestly, I am very skeptical about this. MPs display erratic electrophoretic behaviors on (denaturing) gels as a function of the detergent environment and fraction preparation (among other things). I am not convinced the Fig and results substantiate the claims made by the Authors when it comes to association state.</p>
<p>Based on this comment, this makes the statement on lines 172-173 a bit dubious in my opinion. Based on their extensive complementation assays I agree that all regions (rather than domains, the only domain is the TMD after all) are important to protein function(s) but I would not conclude any further.</p>
<p>The sections on the role of EXP1 in coping with oxidative stress or its effect on artemisin resistance are clear and the results well presented.</p>
<p>The GST related section is clear. I must say that as a biochemist and structural biologist that read the article in Cell (reference 16 from Lisewski et al), it makes me want to cry when I see how poorly characterized the so-called recombinant and pure EXP1 protein expressed in E. coli was in this study. One wonders if it is at all a GST&#8230;</p>
<p>Since the previously postulated function as a heme-detoxifying GST did not appear to be responsible for the phenotype in &#916;EXP1 parasites, the Authors look at other possible pathways and possibly the interaction between EXP1 and EXP2, the PTEX subunit, and thus protein vacuolar trafficking.</p>
<p>If memory serves, EXP1 was not initially identified as a main interacting partner with PTEX (via EXP2 it seems based on this study) in the initial proteomic-based approaches (most from de Koning-Ward&#8217;s group). While subsequent work by this group (this work and reference 30 in 2016) shows IPs with interaction between EXP1 and EXP2. Would the Authors offer an explanation about this?</p>
<p>Line 249. Typo</p>
<p>&#8220;&#916;EXP1 parasites showed NO (instead of not) defect in the export of 249 SBP1, REX1, REX2 &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Line 307.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parasite surface ANION (instead of anyone) channel&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Loss of EXP1 abolished the correct localisation of EXP2, a pore-forming molecule required for the nutrient-permeable channel activity and protein export at the PVM. Unexpectedly loss of EXP1 however affected only the nutrient-permeable channel activity of the PVM but not protein export.&#8221; Could they offer an explanation for the role of EXP1 in proper localization of EXP2?</p>
<p>The Authors show that EXP1 controls the localization of EXP2 but does not affect protein trafficking mediated by EXP2 through PTEX and that only the NP channel activity is defective in &#916;EXP1 parasites: that activity is vacuolar not at the iRBC membrane surface. They also show that the two proteins interact in reciprocal IPs. EXP1 depleted cells are susceptible to amino-acid starvation.</p>
<p>All their results are clear and support their conclusions. These are delicate experiments combining powerful genetic tools in Plasmodium and patch-clamp based measurements on parasites released from their host RB cell.</p>
<p>They demonstrate that EXP1 is required for EXP2-based NP channel activity and functionally distinguish EXP2 roles in nutrient uptake and protein export. Does this hint again at two molecular pools of EXP2: one associated with EXP1 for nutrient uptake and one associated with the rest of the PTEX core components (PTEX150, HSP101) and other ancillary proteins?</p>
<p>Thus, could the Authors make a simple figure that summarizes their model on how EXP1 (and EXP2) interplay in the cell. </p>
<p>They hint at their model at lines 361-362. &#8220;Thus, the expression of two functions, nutrient uptake and protein export, are at least differentially regulated and at most molecularly distinct.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a model and is likely to be imperfect but at least it would summarize their findings in a simple way more easily understandable by a non-specialist reader.</p>

<p>Dear Dr Spielmann,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your revised Research Article entitled "EXP1 is critical for nutrient uptake across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane of malaria parasites" for publication in PLOS Biology. </p>
<p>The Academic Editor and I have now assessed your revision and find it exceptionally well-done. We're delighted to let you know that we're now editorially satisfied with your manuscript. We will publish your study, assuming you are willing to make the final edits to meet our production requirements. Congratulations!</p>
<p>However before we can formally accept your paper and consider it "in press", we also need to ensure that your article conforms to our guidelines. A member of our team will be in touch shortly with a set of requests. As we can't proceed until these requirements are met, your swift response will help prevent delays to publication.</p>
<p>Upon acceptance of your article, your final files will be copyedited and typeset into the final PDF. While you will have an opportunity to review these files as proofs, PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling or significant scientific errors. Therefore, please take this final revision time to assess and make any remaining major changes to your manuscript.</p>
<p>Please note that you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>Please note that an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you opted out when submitting your manuscript. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online, uncheck the box. Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us as soon as possible if you or your institution is planning to press release the article.</p>
<p>To submit your revision, please go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/</ext-link> and log in as an Author. Click the link labelled 'Submissions Needing Revision' to find your submission record. Your revised submission must include a cover letter, a Response to Reviewers file that provides a detailed response to the reviewers' comments (if applicable), and a track-changes file indicating any changes that you have made to the manuscript. </p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lauren A Richardson, Ph.D</p>
<p>Senior Editor</p>
<p>PLOS Biology</p>

<p>Note that we do not require all raw data. Rather, we ask that all individual quantitative observations that underlie the data summarized in the figures and results of your paper be made available in one of the following forms:</p>
<p>1) Supplementary files (e.g., excel). Please ensure that all data files are uploaded as 'Supporting Information' and are invariably referred to (in the manuscript, figure legends, and the Description field when uploading your files) using the following format verbatim: S1 Data, S2 Data, etc. Multiple panels of a single or even several figures can be included as multiple sheets in one excel file that is saved using exactly the following convention: S1_Data.xlsx (using an underscore).</p>
<p>2) Deposition in a publicly available repository. Please also provide the accession code or a reviewer link so that we may view your data before publication. </p>
<p>**Please also ensure that figure legends in your manuscript include information on where the underlying data can be found.**</p>
<p>Please ensure that your Data Statement in the submission system accurately describes where your data can be found.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>BLOT AND GEL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>For manuscripts submitted on or after 1st July 2019, we require the original, uncropped and minimally adjusted images supporting all blot and gel results reported in an article's figures or Supporting Information files. We will require these files before a manuscript can be accepted so please prepare them now, if you have not already uploaded them. Please carefully read our guidelines for how to prepare and upload this data: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements" ns0:type="simple">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements</ext-link>.</p>

</p>
<p>Dear Dr Spielmann,</p>
<p>On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, Tania F de Koning-Ward, I am pleased to inform you that we will be delighted to publish your Research Article in PLOS Biology. </p>
<p>The files will now enter our production system. You will receive a copyedited version of the manuscript, along with your figures for a final review. You will be given two business days to review and approve the copyedit. Then, within a week, you will receive a PDF proof of your typeset article. You will have two days to review the PDF and make any final corrections. If there is a chance that you'll be unavailable during the copy editing/proof review period, please provide us with contact details of one of the other authors whom you nominate to handle these stages on your behalf. This will ensure that any requested corrections reach the production department in time for publication.</p>
<p>Early Version</p>
<p>The version of your manuscript submitted at the copyedit stage will be posted online ahead of the final proof version, unless you have already opted out of the process. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p>
<p>PRESS </p>
<p>We frequently collaborate with press offices. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. If the press office is planning to promote your findings, we would be grateful if they could coordinate with <email ns0:type="simple">biologypress@plos.org</email>. If you have not yet opted out of the early version process, we ask that you notify us immediately of any press plans so that we may do so on your behalf.</p>
<p>We also ask that you take this opportunity to read our Embargo Policy regarding the discussion, promotion and media coverage of work that is yet to be published by PLOS. As your manuscript is not yet published, it is bound by the conditions of our Embargo Policy. Please be aware that this policy is in place both to ensure that any press coverage of your article is fully substantiated and to provide a direct link between such coverage and the published work. For full details of our Embargo Policy, please visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/" ns0:type="simple">http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Thank you again for submitting your manuscript to PLOS Biology and for your support of Open Access publishing. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any assistance during the production process.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Sofia Vickers</p>
<p>Senior Publications Assistant</p>
<p>PLOS Biology</p>
<p>On behalf of,  </p>
