<abstract>
<p>Activins regulate numerous processes including inflammation and are synthesized as precursors consisting of a long N-terminal pro-region and a mature protein. Genomic human databases currently list three activin A (Act A) variants termed X1, X2 and X3. The X3 variant is the shortest, lacks N-terminal segments present in X1 and X2, and has been the focus of most past literature. Here, we asked whether these variants are expressed by human cells and tissues and what structural features are contained within their pro-regions. Human monocytic-like cells THP1 and U937 expressed X1 and X2 variants after exposure to phorbol ester or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, while X2 transcripts were present in placenta. Expression vectors encoding full length X2 or X3 variants resulted in production and secretion of biologically active Act A from cultured cells. Previous studies reported a putative HS-binding domain (HBD) in the X3 pro-region. Here, we identified a novel HBD with consensus HS-binding motifs near the N-terminal end of X1 and X2 pro-regions. Peptides encompassing this new domain interacted with substrate-bound HS with nanomolar affinity, while peptides from putative X3 HBD did not. In good agreement, full length X2 pro-region interacted with heparin-agarose, while the X3 pro-region did not. In sum, our study reveals that Act A variants are expressed by inflammatory cells and placenta and yield biological activity. The high affinity HBD in X1 and X2 pro-region and its absence in X3 could greatly influence overall Act A distribution, availability and activity in physiological and pathological circumstances.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Activins are members of the transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;) superfamily of signaling and growth factor proteins that include bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref002">2</xref>]. Activin A (Act A) was originally purified from gonadal fluids and found to stimulate release of pituitary follicle stimulating hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref004">4</xref>]. Since then, it has become apparent that Act A regulates many physiologic processes and events including cell proliferation and differentiation, wound repair and immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref005">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref008">8</xref>]. Changes in Act A availability or function contribute to various pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>As other TGF-&#946; superfamily members, Act A is initially synthesized as a pre-pro-protein that encompasses a large N-terminal pro-region and a smaller mature protein portion which is subsequently dimerized by a C-terminal disulfide bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref011">11</xref>]. While transitioning through the secretory pathway, the precursors undergo processing by furin-like proteases that cleave them at a prescribed and obligatory cluster of basic amino acids, but do not disrupt the association of pro-region and mature protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref013">13</xref>]. The processed pro-region/mature protein dimeric complexes are finally secreted, and evidence indicates that they can exert autocrine or paracrine roles in multiple tissue and organ functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref009">9</xref>]. Previous studies have examined activin interactions with protein antagonists including follistatin (Fs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref014">14</xref>] and the ability of activins to form diffusion gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref015">15</xref>], presumably via interactions with extracellular matrix components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>The NCBI database lists three human Act A variants, termed X1, X2, and X3. These variants were initially identified and sequenced by the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) Program Team as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref017">17</xref>], but their differences in expression or function have yet to be examined empirically in human cells and tissues. The three variants are predicted to contain the same mature protein, but differ in the length of their pro-region as a result of alternative splicing and translation start site. Much of the past and recent literature has focused on the shortest X3 variant that lacks the longer N-terminal segments characterizing the X1 and X2 variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref011">11</xref>]. In vitro studies have indicated that bioactivity of the entire X3 Act A protein complex is similar to that of the mature protein alone, suggesting that the X3 pro-region may have roles other than influencing ligand availability or receptor-ligand interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref018">18</xref>]. A previous structural analysis of the X3 variant reported the presence of a putative domain in the middle of the pro-region seemingly able to interact with heparan sulfate (HS) and heparin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref019">19</xref>]. To date, similar analyses have not been reported for the X1 and X2 variants.</p>
<p>In other TFG-&#946; superfamily members and BMPs in particular, there is ample evidence that their distribution, availability, bioactivity and turn over are tightly regulated by interactions with HS-rich proteoglycans on the cell surface and extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref021">21</xref>]. In pioneering studies, Cardin and Weintraub were among the first investigators to identify and characterize protein domain(s) responsible for interaction with HS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref022">22</xref>]. Comparative analyses on vitronectin, platelet factor-4, apoliprotein A and apoliprotein B led them to identify two HS-binding amino acid sequences -XBBXBX and XBBBXXBX-, thus named CW motifs, where B represents basic residues (usually Arg or Lys) interacting with reciprocally-charged sulfated carbohydrate residues and X represents non-charged residues. Subsequent studies by multiple investigators have verified these original findings and identified similar motifs or variations in many other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref024">24</xref>]. Notably, the HS chains themselves are endowed with remarkable variability in their patterns of: O-sulfation at C2, C3 and/or C6 positions and N-deacetylation and N-sulfation in glucosamine residues, and C5 epimerization of D-glucuronic acid to L-iduronic acid residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref026">26</xref>]. These overall modifications create short segments with specific sulfation patterns and sugar structure that exhibit binding avidity toward different CW domains on various proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>One example of the fundamental importance of HS-protein interactions was provided by studies showing that mutation of basic residues within the HS-binding domain (HBD) of BMP2 and BMP4 reduced their ability to interact with HS, but greatly increased their biological activity and potency as revealed by in vitro and in vivo assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref029">29</xref>]. These studies showed that at least for certain BMPs, interactions with HS normally serve to restrain, delimit and define their biological activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref030">30</xref>]. Further, we recently showed that while the HBD in BMP2 and BMP4 resides near the N-terminus of the mature protein, that domain resides at the C-terminus in BMP5, BMP6 and BMP7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref031">31</xref>]. Structural analyses suggested that the HBDs in these two BMP subgroups have distinct structural characteristics and spatial orientation, indicating that HBD location and structure are protein-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref032">32</xref>]. In good agreement, we also found that the congenital HS deficiency characteristic of the pediatric disorder Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME) triggers excessive and ectopic canonical BMP signaling in growth plate perichondrium and leads to exostosis (osteochondroma) formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref034">34</xref>], demonstrating that aberrations in normal HS-protein interactions can have severe pathological consequences.</p>
<p>In the present study, we have carried out a detailed examination of Act A variants and in particular, asked whether the X1 and X2 variants are expressed by human cells and tissues and what possible additional structural features may be provided by their longer N-terminal pro-regions. Our data reveal for the first time that the X1 and X2 variants are in fact expressed by human cells and placenta and contain a previously unidentified high affinity HBD toward the N-terminal end of their pro-region that is absent in the X3 pro-region. The diverse structural features of the variants could influence overall Act A availability, range and activity in physiological and pathological circumstances.</p>

<title>Human inhibin genes and expression variants</title>
<p>Previous studies have provided general information and insights into the genomic organization of the human inhibin&#946; genes, designated <italic>INH&#946;A</italic>, <italic>INH&#946;B</italic>, <italic>INH&#946;C</italic> and <italic>INH&#946;E</italic>, that encode Act A, activin B (Act B), activin C (Act C) and activin E (Act E), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref035">35</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref037">37</xref>]. To gain further structural details, we relied on the UCSC Genome Browser (genome.ucsc.edu) and NCBI sequence and gene structure databases. Computer-driven algorithms indicated that human INH&#946;A resides on the short arm of chromosome 7 and is characterized by 7 coding exons spanning an overall genomic segment of about 25Kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g001">Fig 1</xref>, Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222784.t001">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222784.t003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222784.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The NCBI database lists three variants for human INH&#946;A designated X1, X2 and X3 and alignment of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences indicate that the variants are the product of alternative splicing and translation start sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The X1 variant is encoded by exons 2, 3, 6, and 7 and the X2 variant is encoded by exons 1, 6, and 7. The X3 variant includes exons 6 and 7 only, but results from the use of an alternative translation start site within exon 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g001">Fig 1</xref>, arrow in X3). The mature protein is encoded by approximately the 3&#8217; half of exon 7 and is common to all Act A variants, which differ in the length of their pro-regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222784.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). It remains to be clarified whether exons 4 and 5 are incorporated into other as yet undiscovered Act A variants, if other potential exons reside upstream of coding exon 1, and what are the promoter/enhancer elements regulating <italic>INH&#946;A</italic> gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>It should be noted that the above transcript/protein predictions of variants are based on computational genomic analyses that were conducted initially by the MGC team using ESTs to explore the transcriptome and then subsequently confirmed by whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref017">17</xref>]. Much of the past and recent extensive literature on Act A has utilized recombinant forms of the X3 variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref018">18</xref>], but currently there is little information about the expression and structural characteristics of the X1 and X2 variants. Thus, we first asked whether these variants are expressed by myeloid- lineage cells that are amongst the cell types known to produce Act A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref039">39</xref>]. For these studies, we utilized the human monocytic-like cell lines THP1 and U937 that have the capacity to differentiate into macrophages following appropriate stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref040">40</xref>]. For initial experiments, cells were treated with phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA) for 4 hrs to induce differentiation, total cellular RNAs were isolated and processed for cDNA synthesis and semi-quantitative PCR. We used unique forward primers anchored at the ATG start sites of X1 or X2 variants and combined with a common reverse primer that includes the TAG stop codon in exon 7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222784.t004">Table 4</xref>). We found that PMA stimulated expression of transcripts encoding the X2 variant in U937 cells, whose identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the purified PCR product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, lane 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222784.s005">S5 Fig</xref>); however, expression of the X1 variant was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, lane 8). Because the X3 variant shares its entire composition with the X1 and X2 variants and does not have a unique 5&#8217; end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g001">Fig 1</xref>), we did not test its expression using this approach. Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces strong expression of Act A in purified human monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref041">41</xref>]. Thus, U937 and THP1 cells were untreated or treated with GM-CSF (1 ng/ml; 8 hr) and the resulting RNA samples were processed for PCR analysis as above. Interestingly, GM-CSF upregulated the X2 variant in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, Lanes 3, 6), but only stimulated expression of the X1 variant in U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, lane 9). To make sure both cell lines have the cell surface machinery to respond to GM-CSF, we subjected them to FACS analysis using antibodies to its receptor CD116 or pre-immune IgGs as control. Both cell lines exhibited readily detectable levels of CD116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine which Act A variant(s) are expressed under normal physiological conditions, we prepared cDNA from human placental RNA and processed it for PCR using different primer sets. A first set amplified an amplicon covering exons 6 and 7, present in all three Act A variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>, black arrows). Next, we used primer sets containing unique forward primers specific for the 5&#8217; ends of X1 or X2 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, white arrows). This yielded a product encoding the 5&#8217; region of the X2 variant, but no amplification product homologous to the X1 5&#8217; region was obtained (not shown). Thus, the Act A X2 variant is expressed in human placenta.</p>

<p>Together, the data provide new evidence that Act A X1 and X2 variants are expressed by differentiating human monocytic cell lines and human tissue. Because the X1 and/or X2 variants are expressed in response to specific chemical or biological cues, it is possible that they may be expressed and utilized in vivo during specific stages of development and under certain pathologic conditions.</p>

<title>AD293 and COS1 cells secrete biologically active Act A following transfection with X2 and X3 expression vectors</title>
<p>Next, we explored the biological activity of Act A produced and secreted by cultured cells. The entire open reading frame encoding each variant was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+, which utilizes the CMV promotor to drive protein expression. Following verification of constructs by DNA sequencing, each expression construct along with a construct expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was transfected into AD293 cells using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Promega), resulting in a transfection efficiency of &gt; 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Three days after transfection, conditioned medium was harvested and the remaining cells were scraped from the dishes, RNA was isolated, treated with DNAse and subsequently used for cDNA synthesis. Cells transfected with each Act A variant expressed the appropriate mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, lanes 3&#8211;5). Removal of plasmid DNA was confirmed using PCR primers specific for beta-lactamase, which encodes the AmpR gene on pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, right). This amplicon was readily amplified from plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, lane 6), but was absent in cDNAs prepared from cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, lanes 7&#8211;10).</p>

The band was undetectable in conditioned medium from cells transfected with the X1 vector (lanes 1, 4 and 9) or un-transfected cells (lanes 7 and 8).

Note that TIEG expression is up-regulated by treatment with recombinant human Act A (rhActA; lane 2, positive control) as well as conditioned medium from X2 or X3 expressing cells (lanes 4 and 6). This induction was blocked by pre-incubation with a neutralizing antibody to Act A (lanes 3, 5 and 7). Conditioned medium from untransfected cells elicited no TIEG expression (U, lane 1).

<p>To assess protein expression, the conditioned media sample from each transfected cell population was incubated with Talon resin, and the bound proteins were eluted with 0.5M Imidazole and analyzed on immunoblots. AD293 Cells transfected with X2 or X3 expression vectors both secreted a protein of about 13 kDa, consistent with the mass of mature Act A protein under reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, lanes 2, 3, 5 and 6; note that lanes 4&#8211;6 are over-exposed images of lanes 1&#8211;3). This protein band was more prominent in X2 versus X3 transfected cells, but was not detectable in cells transfected with X1 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, lanes 1 and 4). To verify these results, Cos1 cells were transfected with each Act A variant expression construct. Again, immunoblot analysis of conditioned media samples showed secretion of mature Act A ligand only by cells transfected with X2 or X3 variant constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, lanes 10 and 11). To test whether the secreted proteins were biologically active, THP1 cells were treated with commercially available recombinant Act A (rhAct A) or conditioned medium samples obtained from cells transfected with the Act A expression constructs. After 2 hr treatment, RNA was extracted, cDNA was prepared and expression of TIEG -an early response gene upregulated by Act A or TGF-&#946; was assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref042">42</xref>]. As expected, TIEG was rapidly upregulated when cells were treated with rhAct A used as positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, lane 2). A similar strong up-regulation was observed when the cells were exposed to the conditioned medium from cells transfected with X2 and X3 expression constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, lanes 4 and 6). Medium from un-transfected cells produced no response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, lane 1). TIEG induction was blocked when the cells were co-treated with a monoclonal Act A neutralizing antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, lanes 3, 5 and 7). Thus, AD293 and Cos1 cells transfected with X2 and X3 variant expression vectors secrete biologically active Act A.</p>

<title>Act A X1 and X2 variants contain a previously unsuspected HS-binding domain (HBD)</title>
<p>Many TFG-&#946; superfamily members are known to establish high affinity interactions with HS-rich proteoglycans on the cell surface and extracellular matrix that regulate protein distribution, availability, bioactivity and turn over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref021">21</xref>]. A study published in 2010 analyzed the HS-binding properties of Act A X3 variant and reported the identification of a putative HBD located toward the middle of the pro-region and encompassing amino acids 259 to 272 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref019">19</xref>]. This segment corresponds to amino acids 381&#8211;394 and 316&#8211;329 in the X1 and X2 variants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and contains several clusters of lysine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g005">Fig 5A&#8211;5D</xref>, highlighted in green). Notably, this domain also contains four glutamic acid residues, which are predicted to interfere with interactions with the anionic sulfate groups in HS. Thus, we closely reexamined the entire amino acid sequence of the X3 variant and compared it to the X1 and X2 variants. We noted the presence of another basic residue-rich domain located near the N-terminal end of the X1 and X2 pro-regions that closely resembled a CW motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, highlighted in light blue). The domain spans amino acids 78&#8211;102 in X1 and amino acids 13&#8211;37 in X2, but is absent in X3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g005">Fig 5A&#8211;5D</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether the newly identified domain is in fact endowed with HS binding capacity, we prepared a synthetic peptide encompassing this region, which was biotinylated on the N-terminus. The domain is identical in X1 and X2 variants and denoted as X2<sup>13-37</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In addition, we prepared a biotinylated peptide encompassing the previously described putative HS-binding region in X3 pro-region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref019">19</xref>], which is designated X3<sup>259-272</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The peptides were tested in solid-phase binding assays, employing 96 well plates pre-coated with HS, following standard protocols established in our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref031">31</xref>]. We found that the X2<sup>13-37</sup> peptide interacted with HS with high affinity, exhibiting a Kd of 4 &#177; 2 nM (n = 3); binding was blocked by pre-incubation of the peptide with excess heparin serving as competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).

<p>Solid-phase assays are widely used to test macromolecular interactions, but may not fully reflect biological conditions. Thus, we tested the peptides for interaction with the cell surface. U937 cells were lightly fixed with formalin to preserve the cell surface and then incubated with biotinylated peptides complexed with NA-488 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref031">31</xref>].

<title>3D peptide and protein conformation analyses</title>
<p>The above data predict that the X2<sup>13-37</sup> HBD should possess a 3D configuration and amino acid distribution able to create a surface(s) amenable to interactions with HS. However, these features and properties should be absent or disrupted in the segment encompassing the X3<sup>259-272</sup> segment. To test these predictions, we utilized the I-TASSER server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref043">43</xref>] as in previous structural studies on BMP family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref031">31</xref>]. We found that the X2<sup>13-37</sup> domain displayed a helical structure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). When examined using helical wheel diagrams, it displayed basic residues (i.e., Lys) mostly on one side, thus generating a cationic surface on one face of the helix, conducive to HS binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g009">Fig 9A, 9C and 9E</xref>). The X3<sup>259-272</sup> segment also displayed a helical configuration, but structural views and helical wheel projections showed that its residues did not elicit a cationic surface suitable for HS interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g009">Fig 9B, 9D and 9F</xref>). Again, the presence of negative charges from the 4 glutamic acid residues within this sequence are predicted to interfere with HS binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g009">Fig 9F</xref>, highlighted in red).</p>

<p>Next, we used the I-TASSER server to visualize the relative location, orientation and configuration of the X2<sup>13-37</sup> and X3<sup>259-272</sup> domains within the full-length X2 variant. The generated structures revealed that the domains occupy locations on opposite sides of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g010">Fig 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222784.s006">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222784.s007">S2</xref> Videos). As also seen in previous crystallography studies of the full-length X3 variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref018">18</xref>], the pro-region is physically separated from the mature protein and connected to it via the latency lasso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). To more clearly determine whether the X2<sup>13-37</sup> domain created an exposed HS-binding surface, we analyzed the structures at different rotational angles. Orthogonal views revealed that the domain created a cationic surface facing away from the protein moiety and likely accessible for interactions with HS (see S6 and S7 V\. In contrast, the X3<sup>259-272</sup> segment was also positioned on the outer perimeter of the protein, but its acidic amino acid composition prevented it from generating a suitable cationic surface (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g009">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g010">10</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data reveal that the X1 and X2 variants of Act A are expressed by human inflammatory cells in response to PMA and GM-CSF and in human placenta. The variants differ from each other at the N-terminal end of their pro-region, but share the bulk of the pro-region and the entire mature protein. Our data also show for the first time that the X1 and X2 variants possess a domain in the pro-region that exhibits typical CW characteristics and binds to HS and the cell surface readily and with high affinity. As suggested by 3D stereological analysis, the basic residues in the domain are organized to produce an anionic surface that is adept at HS binding and oriented toward the outer perimeter of the pro-region. Because Act A is assembled and secreted as a dimer held together by an intermolecular disulfide bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref018">18</xref>], each dimer would possess two such HBDs oriented away from each other and potentially functioning autonomously. This is reminiscent of the situation in certain BMP family members such as BMP2 and BMP4 in which the two HBDs in each dimer are distinct in terms of location, action and interactions and act in a bivalent manner in binding assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref029">29</xref>]. However, this appears not be the case for BMP5, BMP6 and BMP7 where the two HBDs come together to form a single central cationic surface within each dimer, likely as a result of their location at the C-terminus of each of the two closely juxtaposed mature proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref031">31</xref>]. These observations and considerations highlight the fact that the HBDs in different proteins differ in location, organization, specific amino acid sequences and number of basic clusters, though they all share fundamental traits of CW motifs. The significant structural variability amongst HBDs in different proteins are likely to have physiological significance in terms of protein availability, distribution and orientation within the extracellular matrix or cell surface as well as with respect to protein interactions with specific HS-proteoglycans and even endogenous protein competitors and antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref020">20</xref>]. This conclusion is also sustained by the fact that the domains in many such proteins are evolutionarily conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref020">20</xref>], but details about their functional significance still need to be fully clarified and understood.</p>
<p>In the standard binding assays used here, peptide X3<sup>259-272</sup> spanning the previously reported HS-binding region of the X3 variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref019">19</xref>] failed to interact with substrate-bound HS or the cell surface (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g007">7</xref>). Moreover, the entire pro-region of X3 failed to interact with heparin, while the pro-region of the X2 variant did interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g008">Fig 8</xref>). These results are not surprising given that the clusters of basic residue clusters within X3<sup>259-272</sup> contain 4 intervening glutamic acid residues, which would be predicted to prevent the formation of a uniform cationic HS-binding surface, as our 3D data indicate. How then can our data be reconciled with those of Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref019">19</xref>]? A major difference is that in our solid phase and FACs assays (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222784.g007">7</xref>) we made use of peptides corresponding to specific protein domains, while Li et al. made use of full length recombinant X3 variant and perlecan in their solid phase and pulldown experiments. It is possible that full length proteins are able to establish a number of diverse macromolecular interactions with each other in addition to those involving specific segments or motifs interacting with HS chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref044">44</xref>]. HS-rich glypican family members have been shown to interact with Wnts, hedgehogs and other signaling proteins in complex manners, also involving their core protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref046">46</xref>]. In addition, differences in experimental conditions including salt concentration, stringency, washing conditions, buffers, detergents and other parameters could influence outcomes in different studies. We have tested HS derived from different sources including kidney, basement membranes of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma and obtained from different vendors, but the results were the same. Nonetheless, the inhibition of X3 variant/perlecan interactions by heparitinase pre-treatment or mutation of basic residue clusters observed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref019">19</xref>] does suggest that those clusters could have some binding roles, despite the presence of acidic residues. However, their affinity and binding strengths for HS could be far lower than those of the new HBD, X2<sup>13-37</sup>, described here. It is worth recalling that the three major follistatin variants differ in their ability to bind HS, with the shorter variant Fs288 exhibiting the highest affinity and the longest variant Fs315 exhibiting the lowest, likely due to the presence of acidic residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref047">47</xref>]. Hence, future studies will be needed to compare side-by-side the binding affinities and kinetics of the X1, X2 and X3 variants and their respective mutants to HS-rich proteoglycans, define the binding hierarchy of different domains, and decipher their roles and underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>The biosynthesis and elongation of HS chains at serine residues on the proteoglycan core proteins are complex processes involving over 25 enzymes. As indicated above, these step-wise biosynthetic steps results in the creation of segments with specific sulfation and sugar structure patterns, also referred to as &#8216;sulfation codes&#8217; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref026">26</xref>]. Following secretion, the chains can be further modified by tissue-specific sulfatases that selectively remove sulfate groups at specific positions. The resulting diversity and complexity of sulfated segments along the HS chains are thought to serve as specific sites of protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref021">21</xref>]. Complementarily, the diverse HBDs identified in different proteins likely add specificity and enable each protein to recognize and bind distinct segments along HS chains with specific sulfation codes. Some of the most characterized protein-HS interactions are those by members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref049">49</xref>]. FGFs contain a nine amino acid domain or &#8216;glycine box&#8217; that mediates the ability of full-length proteins to selectively bind octasaccharides with different sulfation patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref048">48</xref>]. Our group recently demonstrated that the HBD present in BMP2 and BMP4 competitively inhibits binding of full-length BMP2 protein to HS, while the HBD in BMP5 does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref031">31</xref>]. While we do not know the preferred sulfation code recognized by ActAX2<sup>13-37</sup> HBD, it may enable the pro-region/mature protein complex for X1 and X2 variants to specifically interact with HS-rich proteoglycans on the cell surface and extracellular matrix, thereby regulating signaling, turn over and function.</p>
<p>As pointed out above, past and recent studies on Act A biology and function have made use of the X3 variant or the mature protein but to our knowledge, the X1 or X2 variants have not been tested. For example, Harrington et al. used recombinant Act A mature protein to clarify the structural basis by which Fs inhibits Act A signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref014">14</xref>]. They found that Fs dimers wrap themselves around the back of activin dimer wings reorienting their own EGF- and Kazal-like subdomains. Wang et al. carried out a detailed analysis of mechanisms involved in initiation of Act A biological activity, using the X3 variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref018">18</xref>]. They found that intracellular furin cleavage is required to turn on the biological activity of the newly-synthesized X3 variant; as already pointed out above, the signaling potency of the furin-cleaved X3 complex, containing the pro-region and active ligand, was nerly identical to that of mature protein. Notably, this group found that removal of residues 259 to 272, encompassing the X3<sup>259-272</sup> domain described by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref019">19</xref>], had no effect on biological activity, pointing to a minor if any role of that domain as our data also suggest. Quaternary crystal structure analysis indicated that the two X3 chains form a cross-armed, domain-swapped dimer in which the two central disulfide-linked mature domains wrap around each other and create a connecting bridge to the reminder of the outward oriented globular pro-regions, a configuration different from that in other superfamily members such as TGF-&#946;1. Lastly, Johnson et al. compared the biological activity and half-life of recombinant (cleaved) X3 variant versus mature protein after intravenous injection in male rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref050">50</xref>]. They found that both proteins elicited similar biological activity (monitored by follicle stimulating hormone levels), but the circulating half-life of the entire X3 variant was approximately twice as long as the mature protein (t<sub>1/2</sub> fast = 12.5 min vs 5.5 min, respectively). Undoubtedly, the above studies and related efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref005">5</xref>] have provided numerous important and novel insights into Act A biology. However, in view of the data described here, one has to wonder whether testing the X3 variant and mature protein only can actually uncover and clarify the overall physiologic spectrum of Act A activities and underlying mechanisms. Given that the X1 and X2 variants have a more extended N-terminal pro-region and possess a high affinity HBD that is absent in the X3 variant, the X1 and X2 variants could behave and act differently than the X3 variant or mature protein. For instance, the half-life of systemically-injected X1 and X2 variants is likely to be significantly different compared with that of X3 variant or mature protein, given their expected ability to interact with multiple constituents in both blood and tissues through their high affinity HBD. Interactions of X1 and X2 variants with follistatin could also differ from those of X3 due to their larger structure and presence of the high affinity HBD (X2<sup>13-37</sup>) which could affect the binding of Fs288 or Fs315 variants. Within developing embryonic tissues, Act A is thought to form signaling gradients, but this important process has mainly been studied using exogenous mature protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref051">51</xref>]. It will be interesting to reexamine these issues using the X1 and X2 variants and determine endogenous Act A variant expression, diffusion and gradient formation. In sum, it is possible that previous observations and conclusions derived from studies utilizing mature Act A or the X3 variant may need to be verified and extended by also focusing on the X1 and X2 variants.</p>
<p>In the musculoskeletal research field, interest in Act A biology has been re-invigorated by recent evidence of its pathogenic roles in the pediatric congenital disorder Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref052">52</xref>]. FOP is characterized by episodic formation of extraskeletal cartilage and bone tissue&#8211;a process collectively termed heterotopic ossification (HO)&#8212;at multiple sites, eventually involving much of the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref053">53</xref>]. HO is preceded by local inflammation and over time, the accumulated ectopic tissue causes multiple health problems and impediments&#8212;including skeletal deformities, chronic pain, growth impairment and joint ankylosis&#8212;that increasingly interfere with basic daily functions and can lead to breathing difficulties and premature death. FOP patients bear a missense activating mutation in <italic>ACVR1</italic> that encodes the BMP receptor ALK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref054">54</xref>]. It was previously thought that activity of mutant ALK2 would be boosted by BMP ligands present at HO initiation sites; given that ALK2-driven BMP signaling mediated by canonical phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 is chondrogenic, its enhanced activity would lead to local chondrogenesis followed by osteogenesis and ultimately, HO development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref055">55</xref>]. However, recent studies have indicated that unlike wild type ALK2, mutant ALK2 can also respond to Act A and elicits pSMAD1/5/8 signaling, thus directly linking inflammation to ectopic chondrogenesis and HO formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref052">52</xref>]. These interesting and important studies have left many questions unanswered. It is assumed that inflammatory cells invariably recruited to the prospective site of HO formation are the source of Act A, but to date, this has not been demonstrated. Further, it is unclear which Act A variant(s) are expressed and how the mature protein ligand becomes available for interaction with mutant ALK2 in skeletogenic cells. Likewise, Act A normally signals via pSMAD2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref002">2</xref>], and it remains unknown how its interactions with mutant ALK2 would elicit a switch to pSMAD1/5/8 signaling and what combination(s) of type I and type II receptors are involved. Given our demonstration of the high affinity HBD in the pro-region of X1 and X2 Act A variants, it will be interesting to consider the possibility that synthetic mimetic HS oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222784.ref056">56</xref>] could be used to sequester Act A precursors, rendering the mature protein less available for action at sites of HO formation.</p>

<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Journal Requirements:</p>
<p>1. When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>2.&#160; Please include captions for your Supporting Information files at the end of your manuscript, and update any in-text citations to match accordingly. Please see our Supporting Information guidelines for more information: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information</ext-link>.</p>
<p>3. Regarding blot/gel data: PLOS ONE now requires that submissions reporting blots or gels include original, uncropped blot/gel image data as a supplement or in a public repository. This is in addition to complying with our image preparation guidelines described at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements" ns0:type="simple">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements</ext-link>. These requirements apply both to the main figures and to cropped blot/gel images included in Supporting Information. If the manuscript is positively reviewed, we will ask the authors to provide any missing raw image data for blot/gel results when they submit their first revision. As part of your review, please ensure that figures reporting blot or gel images comply with the journal&#8217;s image preparation guidelines and that the original data are provided following the journal&#8217;s request.&#160; If you have any questions or concerns about blot/gel figures or data for this submission, please email us at <email ns0:type="simple">plosone@plos.org</email> before issuing a decision letter.</p>

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: In this work, authors studied the capacity of the variants X1 and X2 of Activin A to bind heparan sulfate. The experimental procedures included the analysis of human placental RNA and the exposure of human monocytic-like cells to phorbol ester and GM-CSF that stimulates the differentiation to macropohages, where there was noted an increased RNA synthesis of X1 and X2. Synthesis and secretion of all the three variants was tested by transfecting AD293 and COS1 cells, where X2 and X3 were detected. Authors were then showed the binding characteristics of the variants and 3D-structure and protein conformation.</p>
<p>Generally, this manuscript is very well written, clear and well presented. Experiments contain controls and the discussion of the results presents the contribution of this work in the to-date literature.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This manuscript is a relevant contribution in Act A studies. Authors successfully showed the expression and biological activity of X1 and X2 variants. Finally, they presented data regarding X1 and X2 interactions with heparan sulfate, describing a possible regulation mechanism of Act A-related processes. The manuscript is clear and well written and, in order to further improve the quality of the paper, please find bellow some minor suggestions.</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p>Abstract - Please specify in what context the other variants are expressed or change the following sentence adequately - &#8220;Here, we asked whether the other variants are expressed and what additional structural features may be provided by their longer pro-regions&#8221;.</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p>Discussion - I suggest including a topic in discussion associating Act A interactions with HS regarding HS&#8217; sulfation pattern.</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p>Please include statistical information, such as applied tests and p values.</p>
