<abstract>
<p>The emerging and increasing prevalence of bacterial antibiotic resistance is a significant public health challenge. To begin to tackle this problem, it will be critical to not only understand the origins of this resistance but also document environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. In this study we investigated the possibility that both colony and field caught mosquitoes could harbor antibiotic resistant bacteria. Specifically, we characterized the antibiotic resistant bacterial populations from colony-reared <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> larvae and adults and two field caught mosquito species <italic>Coquillettidia perturbans</italic> and <italic>Ochlerotatus canadensis</italic>. The cultured bacterial populations were dominated by isolates belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria. Among the antibiotic resistant populations, we found bacteria resistant to carbenicillin, kanamycin, and tetracycline, including bacteria resistant to a cocktail of all three antibiotics in combination. The antibiotic resistant bacteria were numerically rare, at most 5% of total cell counts. Isolates were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and clustering into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs; 99% sequence identity). 27 antibiotic resistant OTUs were identified, although members of an OTU did not always share the same resistance profile. This suggests the clustering was either not sensitive enough to distinguish different bacteria taxa or different antibiotic resistant sub-populations exist within an OTU. Finally, the antibiotic selection opened up a niche to culture mosquito-associated fungi, and 10 fungal OTUs (28S rRNA gene sequencing) were identified. Two fungal OTUs both classified to the class Microbotryomycetes were commonly identified in the field-caught mosquitoes. Thus, in this study we demonstrate that antibiotic resistant bacteria and certain fungi are common and conserved mosquito microbiome members. These observations highlight the potential of invertebrates to serve as vehicles for the spread of antibiotic resistance throughout the environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mosquitoes, like many complex organisms, live in association with a microbiome made up of bacteria, fungi and viruses [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref001">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref005">5</xref>]. Descriptive studies of the mosquito microbiome suggest that the bacterial species richness of the microbiome is relatively low, generally made up of 10 to 50 species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref006">6</xref>]. As mosquitoes are vectors of blood borne arboviruses, such as West Nile virus, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus, the microbiome has received substantial research as a possible factor that could interact with mosquito vector competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref008">8</xref>]. Yet, these studies are hampered by an inability to systematically manipulate the microbiome.</p>
<p>The generation of axenic mosquitoes, allowing for establishing gnotobiotic hosts with a controlled microbiome, has only been reported recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref010">10</xref>]. Previous studies had relied on antibiotic treatment of the mosquitoes to reduce or &#8220;remove&#8221; the microbiome prior to experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref011">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref014">14</xref>]. However, studies have documented that the mosquito microbiome can harbor antibiotic resistant populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref016">16</xref>] and thus antibiotic treatment is more likely to induce a dysbiosis in the microbiome rather than an elimination of the mosquitoes&#8217; microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref012">12</xref>]. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment can affect the host&#8217;s physiology by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref018">18</xref>]. In this regard, it is often difficult to distinguish the effects of reducing the microbiome load via antibiotics versus potential effects of the antibiotics themselves.</p>
<p>In this study we set out to test how common antibiotic resistant bacteria are among colony-reared and field-caught mosquitoes. We hypothesized that the mosquito microbiome would naturally harbor antibiotic resistant bacterial populations. We further predicted that the wild-caught mosquitoes would harbor larger and more diverse antibiotic resistant populations due to their increased probability of encountering antibiotics in their environment, as the colony mosquitoes had no history of antibiotic treatment.</p>

<title>Rearing and collection of colony mosquitoes</title>
<p>Colony reared mosquitoes (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>; Orlando strain) were maintained using standard conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref009">9</xref>]. Larvae from the same egg hatch were collected from rearing pans with a Pasteur pipette and serially rinsed through three Petri dishes containing sterile water to remove external adhering bacteria. Adult female mosquitoes were collected 24 hours post blood feeding (hpbf) from females with a still visible blood bolus to ensure that the mosquito had blood fed, which insured the mosquitoes were in a similar physiological state.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Testing colony-reared mosquitoes for antibiotic resistance genes</title>
<p>To investigate the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in the microbiome of colony-reared mosquitoes we employed a quantitative PCR array. Total DNA was extracted from a pool of three larvae and from the dissected midguts of three female adults 24 hpbf. DNA was extracted with the DNeasy PowerSoil kit (Qiagen) using standard protocols as previously described for mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref009">9</xref>]. The DNA was employed as a template for a Qiagen 96-well Microbial DNA qPCR Array (Antibiotic Resistant genes). This array detects 84 antibiotic resistant genes across multiple antibiotic classes and also includes two pan bacteria and positive PCR controls to test for the presence of inhibitors and PCR efficiency. A full list of the genes detected in the assay can be found on the manufacture&#8217;s website. Quantitative PCR was performed on a BioRad C1000 Touch Thermocycler with CFX96 Real-Time System. Thermalcycling conditions consisted of 10 minutes at 95&#176;C, followed by 40 cycles of: 15 seconds at 95&#176;C and 2 minutes 60&#176;C and a 1&#176;C/s ramp rate (as recommended by the assay manufacture) with FAM fluorophore detection. Values for cycle quantification value (C<sub>q</sub>) were recorded for each well and positive detections were based on the manufacture&#8217;s recommendations.</p>

<title>Field collection of mosquitoes</title>
<p>Mosquito trapping was conducted as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref019">19</xref>]. Briefly, CO<sub>2</sub> (dry ice) baited CDC miniature light traps equipped with aluminum domes were collected from six sites around Connecticut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Mosquitoes were collected as part of the state of Connecticut Mosquito Trapping and Arbovirus Surveillance Program. The Connecticut Mosquito Trapping and Arbovirus Surveillance Program was established by Public Act 97&#8211;289 in 1997. Traps were placed in the field in the afternoon, operated overnight, and retrieved the following morning. Adult mosquitoes were transported alive to the laboratory each morning in an ice chest lined with cool packs. Mosquitoes were immobilized with dry ice and transferred to chill tables where they were identified to species with the aid of a stereo microscope (90X) based on morphological characters. Individual females of two species, <italic>Coquillettidia perturbans</italic> and <italic>Ochlerotatus canadensis</italic> were identified and separated with sterile tweezers and processed for bacterial isolation immediately after collection from the field.</p>

<title>Bacterial culturing and isolation</title>
<p>In initial experiments we tested the bacterial recovery from individual colony-reared and field-caught mosquitoes. For the colony mosquitoes an individual was sufficient to recover <italic>c</italic>.<italic>a</italic>. 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> colony-forming units (CFUs; for larvae and post blood fed females) whereas individual field-caught mosquitoes displayed much lower CFUs, often with too few to reliably enumerate from an individual. For this reason, the field-caught mosquitoes were processed in pools of 6 individuals.</p>
<p>Prior to culturing individuals were washed in a solution of 90% ethanol to remove external adhering bacteria. Individual or pooled mosquitoes were placed in a sterile 1.5 ml tube and crushed with a sterile pellet pestle in a volume of 250 &#956;l of sterile phosphate buffered saline. For plating, a 100 &#956;l aliquot of the homogenate was serially diluted and used for spread plating as diagramed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Mosquito homogenates were plated on LB media with no antibiotics to enumerate the total culturable microbial populations. Mosquito homogenates were also plated on LB plates containing carbenicillin (100 &#956;g/ml), a carboxypenicillin antibiotic with action against peptidoglycan and cell wall synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref020">20</xref>]; kanamycin (50 &#956;g/ml), an aminoglycoside antibiotic with action against the bacteria 30S ribosomal subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref021">21</xref>], and tetracycline (50 &#956;g/ml) a polyketide antibiotic which also targets the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref022">22</xref>]. Finally, LB plates were also made with a cocktail of all three antibiotics in combination to identify multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria.</p>

In this manner 10 random colonies were selected to represent a low-resolution profile of the culturable microbial community. <bold>D</bold>).

<p>Ten random colonies were isolated and characterized from LB plates to generate a low-resolution characterization of the cultivable microbial populations associated with mosquitoes. For antibiotic resistant colonies, growth characteristics and colony morphology guided selection, in order to recover the broadest diversity of isolates. In this respect, this sampling procedure was designed to gain insights into both the structure of the culturable microbial populations through non-selective culturing, and a broad characterization of the antibiotic resistant bacterial populations within the mosquito microbiome.

<title>Bacterial isolation, DNA extraction, and PCR of bacterial 16S rRNA genes</title>
<p>All isolates were streaked to single colonies over three generations to obtain pure cultures. Each isolate was then grown in liquid LB media for generating frozen permanent stocks and for DNA isolation. DNA was isolated from a 1 ml aliquot of an overnight culture using the E.Z.N.A. Bacterial DNA Kit (Omega BIO-TEK) with the difficult to lyse bacteria optional protocol. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the universal primers 515F and 806R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref024">24</xref>] and amplification conditions consisting of initial denaturation 95 &#176;C, 3 minutes; 30 cycles of the following, 95 &#176;C, 45 seconds; 55 &#176;C, 45 seconds; 72 &#176;C, 1 minute and 45 seconds; followed by a final extension of 10 minutes at 72 &#176;C. The resulting amplicons were verified by gel electrophoresis and the PCR reaction was cleaned using the E.Z.N.A. Cycle Pure Kit (Omega BIO-TEK). Purified PCR products were sequenced at the Yale Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory by standard Sanger chemistry and the 515F primer as the sequencing primer.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Fungal isolates</title>
<p>Isolates that were not successfully amplified with the bacterial universal primers were visualized by light microscopy. The majority of the isolates appeared to be fungal cells. For these isolates the fungal LSU gene was amplified with the LR22R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref025">25</xref>] and LR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref026">26</xref>] primer set and identical amplification, cleaning, and sequencing conditions as for PCR described above.</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Bioinformatic analyses</title>
<p>Bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal LSU sequences were quality filtered in the Geneious software package (version 8.1.9) and only sequences with a length of 250 b.p. and quality score greater than 80% were retained. Sequences were assigned to OTUs in the mothur software package (v.1.40.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref027">27</xref>]. OTUs were assigned with 99% sequence identity. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were classified with na&#239;ve Bayesian Classifier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref028">28</xref>] against the SILVA database (version 132; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref029">29</xref>]) as implemented in mothur. The fungal LSU sequences were classified against the Fungal LSU Training set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref030">30</xref>] also hosted with mothur.</p>
<p>Representative sequences for each OTU (calculated used abundance weighted scoring) were uploaded to the NCBI Nucleotide database with accession numbers MN046275- MN046301 for bacterial 16S rRNA genes and MN046918-MN046927 for fungal 28S rRNA genes.</p>

<title>Identification of antibiotic resistance genes in colony reared mosquitoes</title>
<p>The first goal of the project was to test the colony-reared mosquito microbiome for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes by qPCR. A non-overlapping set of seven antibiotic resistance genes were detected in the colony larvae and adults (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0218907.t001">Table 1</xref>). These data suggest that there was a significant shift in the microbial community between the larvae and adults, as they had no resistance genes in common. The resistance genes detected encompassed four classes of antibiotic resistance, suggesting diverse modes of action in resistance. Thus, these data demonstrate the potential for the colony-reared mosquito microbiome to harbor antibiotic resistance. Based on these data a program to isolate antibiotic resistant bacteria was pursued.</p>

<title>Plate counts</title>
<p>The viable cell counts were determined for each culture condition. The LB medium with no antibiotics consistently recovered the highest number of CFUs. Antibiotic resistant populations only made up a small fraction of the cells recovered on LB, never exceeding 5% but generally below 1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

<title>Characterization of bacterial isolates</title>
<p>A total of 198 bacterial isolates were cultured and characterized through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Clustering of the sequences (99% sequence identity) recovered 27 OTUs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218907.s002">S2 Table</xref>).

<title>The cultivable microbiome among mosquitoes</title>
<p>For the bacteria cultured on LB medium, 10 strains were randomly selected for sequencing from each individual mosquito or pool in order to obtain a low-resolution profile of the diversity, abundance, and conservation of bacteria among the mosquitoes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The patterns of OTU conservation clearly distinguished the colony-raised larvae and adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The OTUs from the larvae were predominantly from the class Actinobacteria, compared to Gammaproteobacteria for the adults. In fact, no OTUs from the LB plates were shared between the colony larvae and adults, suggesting that the numerically dominant community members differed between the two mosquito developmental stages.</p>

<p>The pattern of OTU conservation also distinguished the colony reared-mosquitoes from the wild caught mosquitoes. The number and taxonomic diversity of OTUs recovered from the wild caught mosquitoes tended to be larger than for the colony mosquitoes. For instance, bacteria of the classes Bacteroidia and Bacilli were only present in the wild mosquitoes (on the non-selective LB media). The OTUs were also largely unique to either the colony or wild populations. Indeed, only one OTU (Otu06) was found in both the colony and wild caught mosquitoes. Yet, across the different adult mosquitoes the dominant OTUs were generally within the class Gammaproteobacteria, suggesting these bacteria are particularly well adapted for life in association with mosquitoes. Taken together, these observations indicate that even a shallow sampling of the cultivable microbial diversity was sufficient to distinguish the microbial community between colony-raised larvae and adult <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, describe differences amongst the colony reared and wild caught mosquitoes, and identify a predominance of Gammaproteobacteria in the mosquito associated bacteria. However, as all culturing was performed on LB media these data likely only represent a proportion of the total bacterial diversity and favor fast growing bacterial species.</p>

<title>Characterization of antibiotic resistant bacteria</title>
<p>Sampling of antibiotic resistant bacteria targeted diversity rather than abundance in order to recover the broadest selection of antibiotic resistant colonies. The recovered bacteria were identified as belonging to 22 OTUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Carbenicillin and kanamycin resistant bacteria were the most commonly recovered, matching observations from the plate counts, indicating carbenicillin and kanamycin resistant isolates were most abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

<title>Heterogeneity of antibiotic resistance within an OTU</title>
<p>A potential weakness of this sampling strategy was that isolates from a single antibiotic containing plate might have clustered into an OTU with multi-antibiotic resistant strains. In this respect, the multi-drug resistance of an OTU was not directly tested for every isolate in that OTU. To assay if all of the members of an OTU had identical resistance profiles, the isolates making up Otu01 and Otu07, which contained isolates resistant to all three antibiotics, were challenged in a multi-resistance assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g006">Fig 6</xref>). For both OTUs a subset of the isolates were resistant to only a single antibiotic, whereas the remainder were resistant to all three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In this respect, OTU membership was not a perfect predictor of an isolate&#8217;s antibiotic resistance phenotype.</p>

<title>Fungal isolates</title>
<p>Multiple isolates (30) were determined to be fungi through microscopy, and were subsequently characterized by sequencing of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene. The sequences clustered into 10 OTUs (99% sequence identity). Fungal OTUs were classified to both the Basidiomycota and Ascomycota lineages. The OTUs were further classified to five classes with two OTUs only classified to the Domain and Phylum level, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218907.s003">S3 Table</xref>). All but two of the isolates (both clustering within fungal Otu01) were isolated from antibiotic containing plates. This suggests that the reduction of bacterial numbers by the antibiotics opened up a niche to culture fungal cells. With the exception of the colony-reared adults, fungi were identified in every mosquito pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Although, only a single fungal isolate was identified in the colony larvae, indicating that fungal abundance was limited in colony-rearing conditions. The wild caught mosquitoes showed an overlap in membership with two fungal OTUs (Otu01 and Otu02) being conserved among the majority of the pools of wild mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Both OTUs were classified to the class Microbotryomycetes, suggesting this group of fungi may be common mosquito-associated organisms. The remaining fungal OTUs were all unique to a single mosquito pool, indicating they are less likely to form cosmopolitan stable associations with mosquito hosts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The majority of research investigating the capacity of insects to harbor antibiotic resistant bacteria has focused on flies and their potential role as vectors to transport antibiotic resistant bacteria from animal production facilities to human populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref031">31</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref034">34</xref>]. Additionally, honeybee and various plant feeding insects have also been found to carry antibiotic resistant bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref036">36</xref>]. Here we show that antibiotic resistant bacteria, including multiple-antibiotic resistant isolates, are commonly recovered from colony-reared and wild-caught mosquitoes, across three different mosquito genera. These data suggest that the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is wide spread among mosquito populations. Yet, the finding of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the colony-reared mosquitoes was surprising, in that the colony has no history of antibiotic treatment. It is increasingly recognized that antibiotic resistant genes can be maintained in the absence of direct selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref038">38</xref>]. Thus, previous antibiotic exposure may not always be an indicator for the presence of antibiotic resistance determinants. Mosquitoes are a recognized public health threat as the vector of many diseases. Thus, the finding that mosquitoes also appear to consistently carry antibiotic resistant bacteria could cause some concern. However, as the majority of human pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes are viruses there is a seemingly low risk that mosquitoes will act as a vector of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. Yet, mosquitoes are mobile, traveling up to a few kilometers per day with longer distance dispersals facilitated by wind and human transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref039">39</xref>], as such they could act as a vector for spreading antibiotic resistant bacteria between environments. Insects have already been identified as a possible route by which antibiotic resistance determinants are spread from rural to urban areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>The most common antibiotic resistant genes detected in the colony-reared mosquito microbiome were beta-lactamases, of which two classes were identified. Beta-lactamases may be among the most common and cosmopolitan resistance genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref041">41</xref>]. Up to 90% of tested soils contained beta-lactamase resistance genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref042">42</xref>], supporting the ubiquitous nature of these genes in the environment. An Aminoglycoside-resistance gene was also detected which could potentially explain the high population numbers resistant to kanamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The wide distribution of aminoglycoside resistant genes has significantly reduced the use of these antibiotics in clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Two of the isolates met the requirements to be considered multi-drug resistant, defined as being resistant to at least 3 classes of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref045">45</xref>]. Thus, those isolates capable of growth on the antibiotic cocktail of the three antibiotics employed in this study meet this criterion. One of the multi antibiotic resistant OTUs (Otu01) was classified to the genus <italic>Elizabethkingia</italic>. Organisms from this genus have been previously been isolated from field-caught mosquitoes from The Gambia, and isolates demonstrate broad spectrum antibiotic resistance, including ampicillin, kanamycin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref015">15</xref>]. Here we demonstrate a similar multi-drug resistant phenotype from an <italic>Elizabethkingia</italic>-related isolate from colony-reared <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. An observation of note is that isolates that clustered into the same multi-resistant OTU showed heterogeneous antibiotic resistance profiles. For instance, the majority of isolates within Otu01 were resistant to all three antibiotics tested, but 4 (12%) were sensitive to only a single antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This could be explained by resistance genes being present on plasmids or transposons only shared among subpopulations of an OTU. Similarly, point mutations in resistance genes could only be present in a fraction of the OTU members. Alternatively, the clustering of isolates with differing phenotypes could be due to the short fragment of the 16S rRNA gene sequenced in this study (<italic>c</italic>.<italic>a</italic>. 259 b.p.). In this regard, longer 16S rRNA gene sequences or multi-locus sequencing may have been better able to distinguish the isolates as different taxa. Yet, these are the same primers used for the Earth Microbiome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref046">46</xref>] and are likely among the most commonly employed primers for culture-independent microbial diversity assays. So any other study employing these primers would have likely generated similar OTUs. These data highlight that OTU membership can be a flawed predictor for antibiotic resistance phenotype.</p>
<p>Finally, through our efforts to culture antibiotic resistant bacteria we opened up a niche to culture fungal isolates from the mosquitoes. Fungi were more common and abundant among the wild-caught mosquitoes, suggesting that colony-rearing conditions may not be conducive for mosquito-associated fungi, or at least mosquito associated fungi were not abundant in the laboratory. The finding of conserved fungal OTUs, particularly belonging to the class Microbotryomycetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218907.g007">Fig 7</xref>) between mosquitoes collected at disparate sites suggests that these fungi form stable relationships with mosquitoes. The majority of research into mosquito-fungal associations has generally focused on entompopathogenic fungi and their role in mosquito control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref047">47</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref049">49</xref>], whereas the potential role of fungi as commensal flora has been generally neglected. Yet, studies have documented fungal taxa such as <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Penicillium</italic>, <italic>Candidia</italic>, and <italic>Fusarium</italic> associated with mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref051">51</xref>]. Presumably all of these fungi are not pathogens. One family of fungi, the Harpellales, has been shown to benefit mosquito larval development and thus has been considered to be a commensal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218907.ref053">53</xref>]. But by in large the potential role and beneficial relationships between mosquitoes and fungi has been under studied. Here we show fungi may be conserved microbiome members amongst wild-caught mosquitoes, but their potential role in mosquito biology is essentially unknown.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The data presented here demonstrate the potential of mosquitoes to act as an environmental reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including multi-drug resistant strains. Furthermore, the presence of conserved fungal OTUs among field-caught mosquitoes collected from disparate locations points to a role for fungi to associate with mosquitoes. Thus, antibiotic resistant bacteria and fungi should be considered to common members of the mosquito microbiome.</p>

<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: N/A</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This reviewer enjoyed very much in reading this excellent manuscript. This work combines the fields of the vector-borne diseases, antimicrobial resistance and microbiology. The manuscript is well written, and the conclusion is well supported by the data. Main comments:</p>
<p>1) I strongly feel like that the portion of commensal fungi can be left out for another independent publication. Please focus on the beauty of this work, antimicrobial resistance and mosquitoes. Do not get distracted by the addition of fungi, in which you did not get any isolates, and cannot characterize the nature of their antimicrobial resistance;</p>
<p>2) For the field-caught mosquitoes, did you try to wash the mosquitoes before performing bacterial isolation etc? There are constant contact between mosquitoes and animal hosts/environmental surfaces etc. The identified microbiome could be on the surface of the mosquitoes, or their inside? Please provide more information, and make meaningful discussion;</p>
<p>3) As indicated in Fig 2 (Schematic diagram of bacterial culturing), you used LB initially, followed by the utilization of different selective media. Please justify this approach. What would you get if you would use the selective media directly without the use of LB media? Even LB is not a type of selective media, the process of LB culture may still provide some preference of certain bacteria which overgrow over others;</p>
<p>4) It is great that the authors used the bioinformatics to identify bacterial OUTs in this work. In the meantime, it would be more clinically more important and meaningful if you could identify the genus level and even species level of the isolated bacterial from the antibiotics-resistant plates. You are very close to provide this valuable information since these isolates are available to you, and you can even ID them by the use of the whole-length 16S rRNA sequencing.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Well done paper.</p>
<p>On line 95 I think you are missing the word resistant - it states antibiotic populations and I think you meant to say antibiotic resistant populations. That is the only change that I have.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>6. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ns0:type="simple">what does this mean?</ext-link>). If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
<p>If you choose &#8220;no&#8221;, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
<p><bold>Do you want your identity to be public for this peer review?</bold> For information about this choice, including consent withdrawal, please see our <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.plos.org/privacy-policy" ns0:type="simple">Privacy Policy</ext-link>.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: </p>
<p>This reviewer enjoyed very much in reading this excellent manuscript. This work combines the fields of the vector-borne diseases, antimicrobial resistance and microbiology. The manuscript is well written, and the conclusion is well supported by the data. </p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their kind comments. </p>
<p>Main comments:</p>
<p>1) I strongly feel like that the portion of commensal fungi can be left out for another independent publication. Please focus on the beauty of this work, antimicrobial resistance and mosquitoes. Do not get distracted by the addition of fungi, in which you did not get any isolates, and cannot characterize the nature of their antimicrobial resistance;</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>We feel that the fungal data should remain in the current manuscript. Our reasoning is as follows:</p>
<p>These data are based on isolates. As we state in line 356 &#8220;through our efforts to culture antibiotic resistant bacteria we opened up a niche to culture fungal isolates from the mosquitoes&#8221;. We hypothesize that we recovered these fungal isolated by reducing the bacterial load on the antibiotic plates. We did not actually set out to culture fungi. In this regard our base media (LB) was not optimized for fungal recovery, as such the identification of fungi was a spurious finding in this study, not an objective. This data would not likely be sufficient for an independent manuscript. </p>
<p>2) For the field-caught mosquitoes, did you try to wash the mosquitoes before performing bacterial isolation etc? There are constant contact between mosquitoes and animal hosts/environmental surfaces etc. The identified microbiome could be on the surface of the mosquitoes, or their inside? Please provide more information, and make meaningful discussion;</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>This is something that we took care to control for but failed to mention in the methods. We have revised the methods to read &#8220;Prior to culturing individuals were washed in a solution of 90% ethanol to remove external adhering bacteria.&#8221; line 148</p>
<p>3) As indicated in Fig 2 (Schematic diagram of bacterial culturing), you used LB initially, followed by the utilization of different selective media. Please justify this approach. What would you get if you would use the selective media directly without the use of LB media? Even LB is not a type of selective media, the process of LB culture may still provide some preference of certain bacteria which overgrow over others;</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>The selective plates were LB plates supplemented with antibiotics. The purpose of this was to determine the proportion of antibiotic resistant cells in the &#8220;total&#8221; population. To avoid confusion we have added &#8220;LB media supplemented with antibiotics&#8221; to the figure legend of Figure 2 to make it clear that the media formulation is the same between all of the plates. </p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that only using LB media likely influenced the bacteria that we recovered. We have added the following &#8220;However, as all culturing was performed on LB media these data likely only represent a proportion of the total bacterial diversity and favor fast growing bacterial species&#8221; to the results.</p>
<p>4) It is great that the authors used the bioinformatics to identify bacterial OUTs in this work. In the meantime, it would be more clinically more important and meaningful if you could identify the genus level and even species level of the isolated bacterial from the antibiotics-resistant plates. You are very close to provide this valuable information since these isolates are available to you, and you can even ID them by the use of the whole-length 16S rRNA sequencing.</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>While we agree with the reviewer that full-length sequencing could improve some of the ability to discern OTU&#8217;s, we argue that performing full length sequencing is not warranted for the following reasons.</p>
<p>1. Even full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing is not generally considered to be sufficient to differentiate species or strains. This level of discrimination is generally performed by multi-locus sequencing, DNA-DNA reassociation kinetics, or whole genome sequencing, which is beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<p>2. Even with the short fragment that we sequenced ~75% of the isolates were classified to genus with &gt;80% confidence (line 232).  In this respect, there is likely to be little improvement in our data with full-length gene sequencing.</p>
<p>3. We have dedicated a section of our discussion (line 356) to discuss the potential limitations of using a short sequence fragment, so have already addressed this concern in the manuscript.  </p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Well done paper.</p>
<p>On line 95 I think you are missing the word resistant - it states antibiotic populations and I think you meant to say antibiotic resistant populations. That is the only change that I have.</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>The suggested change has been made.</p>
