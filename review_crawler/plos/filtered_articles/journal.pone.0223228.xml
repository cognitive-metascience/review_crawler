<abstract>
<p>Chloroplast plays an important role in the plant life cycle. However, the details of its development remain elusive in rice. In this study, we report the fine-mapping of a novel rice gene <italic>wpb1</italic> (white panicle branch 1), which affects chloroplast biogenesis, from a tropical <italic>japonica</italic> variety that results in an albino panicle branches at and after the heading stage. The <italic>wpb1</italic> variety was crossed with Nipponbare to generate the F<sub>2</sub> and BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub> populations. Green and white panicle branch phenotypes with a 3:1 segregation ratio was observed in the F<sub>2</sub> population. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) based on whole genome resequencing was conducted to determine the <italic>wpb1</italic> locus. A candidate interval spanning from 11.35 to 23.79M (physical position) on chromosome 1 was identified. The results of BSA analysis were verified by a 40K rice SNP-array using the BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub> population. A large-scale F<sub>2</sub> population was used to pinpoint <italic>wpb1</italic>, and the locus was further narrowed down to a 95-kb interval. Furthermore, our results showed that the expression levels of the majority of the genes involved in Chl biosynthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development were remarkably affected in <italic>wpb1</italic> variety and in F<sub>2</sub> plants with a white panicle branch phenotype. In line with the results mentioned above, anatomical structural examination and chlorophyll (Chl) content measurement suggested that <italic>wpb1</italic> might play an important role in the regulation of chloroplast development. Further cloning and functional characterization of the <italic>wpb1</italic> gene will shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying chloroplast development in rice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chlorophyll (Chl) is green pigments found in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of algae and green plants on Earth. Chlorophyll is essential, allowing plants to absorb light energy and perform photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref001">1</xref>]. In addition, chlorophyll plays an critical role in human health, including cancer treatment and prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref002">2</xref>]. Chlorophyll molecules are structural constituents of photosystems that are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. Thus, chloroplasts are important organelles for the fixation of light energy for the life of plants, and any other life in our biosphere. The initiation and development of chloroplasts are jointly regulated by the nuclear genome and chloroplast genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref003">3</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that mutation of genes that control chloroplast development or chlorophyll synthesis leads to albinism in some specific parts of the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref004">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref007">7</xref>]. The mutations seriously affect the photosynthetic efficiency, resulting in reduced production and even causing the developmental arrest of plants. Many related genes have been cloned and functionally characterized. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>ALB3</italic>, which is encoded by a nucleic gene, is transported into chloroplasts and embedded into the chloroplastic membrane, where it is involved in the composition of the chloroplast enzymatic complex. Loss of function of <italic>Alb3</italic> gives rise to a white or yellow cotyledons and leaves, leading to stop growing beyond the seedling stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref008">8</xref>]. An <italic>ylc1</italic> mutant of <italic>indica</italic> rice 9B, which was induced by <sup>60</sup>Co radiation, resulted in a decrease in chlorophyll and lutein content at different temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref009">9</xref>]. In tobacco, an <italic>ali</italic> albino mutant with an albino phenotype was obtained by irradiating BY-4 tobacco with a 14N ion beam, and the expressions of plastid-encoded genes <italic>rbcL</italic> and <italic>psbA</italic> in the mutant was down-regulated dramatically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref010">10</xref>]. <italic>FA85</italic> is a natural mutant of winter wheat. The leaf colour of the mutant is whitened, and the abundances of ATPase-&#947; and GP1-&#945; are up-regulated, while the biosynthesis of other chloroplastic proteins is remarkably inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref011">11</xref>]. Moreover, in maize, the <italic>ppr4</italic> gene encodes a chloroplast-targeted protein containing a <italic>PPR</italic> sequence and RNA recognition elements. PPR4 directly targets the intron of <italic>rps12</italic> and affects the accumulation of <italic>rps12</italic> mRNA in chloroplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The molecular mechanism of rice albino phenotypes is complex. At present, more than 100 genes related to leaf colour alternation in rice have been reported (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.gramene.org/" ns0:type="simple">http://www.gramene.org/</ext-link>, up to now). These genes are involved in chloroplast development regulation, chlorophyll synthesis or degradation, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref013">13</xref>]. For example, rice <italic>v3</italic> and <italic>stl</italic> genes impair the synthesis of plastid DNA and hinder chloroplast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref014">14</xref>]; The <italic>virescent-l</italic> (<italic>v1</italic>), <italic>virescent-2</italic> (<italic>v2</italic>), and <italic>vyl</italic> genes were found to hinder the formation of chloroplasts, resulting in white streaks on rice leaves. In their WT plants, these genes highly express in the second stage of chloroplast development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref015">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref017">17</xref>]; Rice <italic>wsl</italic> and <italic>wsl4</italic> genes, which encoded proteins WSL and WSL4, respectively, involved in RNA metabolism in chloroplasts. Their mutations caused abnormal splicing of <italic>rpl2</italic>, <italic>ndhA</italic>, <italic>atpF</italic> and other chloroplast gene transcripts, resulting in leaf streaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref019">19</xref>]. In addition, another class of genes, such as <italic>WSL3</italic> and <italic>YSS1</italic>, encode the proteins that targeted the chloroplast nucleoid and played a key role in regulating the expression of genes related to Plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerase (PEP). Their mutations resulted in a white streak phenotype in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>At present, the albino phenotypes have been observed on the panicle, seedlings and leaves of rice, for example, in addition to two albino mutants <italic>v1</italic> and <italic>v2</italic> mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref022">22</xref>], another two classical panicle colour mutants <italic>wp1</italic> and <italic>wp2</italic>, which were used as morphological markers in the field, show albino coloration on the whole panicles. The <italic>wp1</italic> locus was located on chromosome 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref023">23</xref>]. Li <italic>et al</italic>. fine mapped a white panicle controlling gene <italic>wp(t)</italic> between the markers SSR101 and SSR63.9 on chromosome 1, which was close to the morphological marker <italic>wp2</italic> and might be another allelic mutation of <italic>wp2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref024">24</xref>]. The <italic>wp1</italic> and <italic>wp2</italic> mutants were all whitened along the entire panicle. In addition, the mutations of other genes that have been reported to control the related traits of white panicle in rice, including <italic>st-wp</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref024">24</xref>], <italic>slwp</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref025">25</xref>], <italic>alsm6</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref026">26</xref>], <italic>st-fon</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref027">27</xref>], <italic>wp4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref028">28</xref>], <italic>wlp1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref029">29</xref>], <italic>wlp6</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref013">13</xref>], <italic>wslwp</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref030">30</xref>], and <italic>wsp1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref031">31</xref>]. However, with the exception of the albino phenomenon observed on the whole panicle, including the rachises, branches, and glumes, it is rare to see the albino phenotype observed only on panicle branches.</p>
<p>SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and InDels (insertions-deletions) are the most common genetic markers in the genome. They have the characteristics of large numbers and rich polymorphisms and are often used in QTL analysis. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) is a rapid method for locating target trait genes and it was initially used in lettuce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref032">32</xref>]. This method constructs two mixing pools by mixing individuals with extreme traits in the segregating population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref033">33</xref>]. By analysing the differences between SNPs and InDels between the two mixing pools, we can quickly locate the molecular markers closely linked with the target gene. This method has been widely used in gene mapping of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref034">34</xref>], rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref036">36</xref>] and maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref037">37</xref>], etc.</p>
<p>In this study, a rice white panicle branch variety <italic>wpb1</italic> was characterized. Its panicle branches showed an albino phenotype with stable heredity. The branches of young panicles were observed to be whitened from the heading stage, and the whitened colour was kept even until the ripening stage. However, the rachis and glumes of the panicles of <italic>wpb1</italic> show normal or light green colour. Therefore, the variety does not show a defect in flowering and seed setting. To our knowledge, the panicle branch albino mutant material is valuable for frescamente ornament, due to its snow-white panicle and streaked leaves, especially in autumn. The locus underlying the <italic>wpb1</italic> phenotype was preliminarily mapped by BSA and 40K rice SNP-array analysis, and then the locus was fine-mapped to the 95-kb interval on chromosome 1. Our results laid a foundation for further cloning of the gene and its functional characterization. Likewise, the study also shed light on the physiological process of chlorophyll biosynthesis, the development of chloroplasts, and photosynthesis.</p>

DNA concentration was measured using a Qubit&#174; DNA Assay Kit in a Qubit&#174; 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). Equal amounts of DNA (1.5 &#956;g/sample) from 30 F<sub>2</sub> plants with white panicle branches were mixed to form the white panicle branch bulk sample (W-pool), and those from another 30 plants with normal (green) branches were mixed to form the normal branch bulk sample (G-pool). Sequencing libraries were constructed using a Truseq Nano DNA HT sample preparation kit (Illumina USA) following the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. In brief, the DNA sample was sheared to a 350-bp fragment by sonication. The obtained DNA fragments were end-polished, A-tailed, and ligated with a full-length adapter for deep sequencing. The libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform with a 20&#215; depth. Sequence data were analysed by Novogene (Beijing, China). To ensure that reads were reliable and without artificial bias, quality control (QC) procedures were set as follows: reads with &#8805;10% unidentified nucleotides were removed, reads with &gt; 50% bases having phred quality &lt; 5 were removed, reads with &gt; 10 nt aligned to the adapter were removed, &#8804;10% mismatches were allowed, putative PCR duplicates generated by PCR amplification in the library construction process were removed.

Sliding window methods were used to present the SNP/InDel index of the whole genome. The average SNP/InDel index in each window was used as the SNP/InDel index for this window. A window size of 1 Mb and a step size of 10 Kb were used as default settings. The difference in the SNP/InDel index of the two pools was calculated as the delta SNP/InDel index. The intervals of the delta all index in the 95% confidence interval of the permutation test were selected as candidate loci.

<p>To further confirm the heredity of white panicle branches in <italic>wpb1</italic>, the F<sub>2</sub> individual plants with white streaked leaves, green glumes, and white branches were backcrossed to NIP to obtain a BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub> line.

The colour phenotype of the BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub> population was also segregated, similar to that in the F<sub>2</sub> population. Among a total of 206 plants, 151 showed green branches, and 55 had white branches.

Moreover, the phenotypes of white-streaked leaves were observed co-segregating with those of white panicle branches.

Two candidate intervals were located on chromosomes 1 and 3 by permutation test with 1000 permutations per test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223228.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Twenty-seven SNPs and 85 InDels were selected as the candidate loci, whose indexes were close to 0.1 in the W-pool and close to 0.9 in the G-pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223228.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Eleven candidate genes that were altered by causing missense, premature termination, losing termination codon mutations or variable splicing sites were selected according to ANNOVAR annotations. Among them, 10 were located on chromosome 1 and 1 was located on chromosome 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223228.s007">S3 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate the BSA result obtained from Illumina sequencing, a genetic background analysis was carried out using a 40k rice SNP array. Thirty green and 30 white panicle branched plants were selected from the BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub> population to construct the mixing pool. The result indicated that the only candidate interval was mapped to physical position from the 9.54 to 14.28 M region of chromosome 1, and the majority of the interval overlapped with the candidate interval mapped in the above BSA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223228.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).

<title>The expressions of genes associated with Chl biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and chloroplast development were altered in <italic>wpb1</italic></title>
<p>In general, the branches and the spikelets of the panicle turn green before heading with the maturation of chloroplasts. The albino phenotype of the <italic>wpb1</italic> variety suggests that the processes of the chloroplasts development and/or Chl biosynthesis were impaired in its panicle branches, and therefore resulting in the inhibition of photosynthesis in panicle branches of the mutant. To validate this possibility, we next examined whether the related processes were compromised in <italic>wpb1</italic> by comparing the relative expression levels of the genes involved in Chl biosynthesis, chloroplast development, and photosynthesis of <italic>wpb1</italic> with those in WT (Nipponbare) and F<sub>2</sub> plants. The expression levels of Chl biosynthesis-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref044">44</xref>], such as <italic>CAO1</italic> (CHLOROPHYLLIDE A OXYGENASE1), <italic>PORA</italic> (encoding NADPH&#8208;dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase), and <italic>HEMA1</italic> (encoding glutamyl tRNA reductase), was significantly downregulated in <italic>wpb1</italic> in contrast to NIP. Similar regulation patterns were observed in the white panicle F<sub>2</sub> plants. Furthermore, the expression of these genes in green branched plants was significantly higher than in the white branched F<sub>2</sub> plant, which was consistent with the difference between their two parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223228.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>For the chloroplast development&#8208;associated genes, we investigated both nuclear&#8208;encoded genes <italic>V1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref004">4</xref>], <italic>V2</italic> (both encoding plastidal guanylate kinase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref006">6</xref>] and plastid genome&#8208;encoded genes <italic>rpoA</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic> (encoding the PEP core &#945;, and &#946; subunit, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref042">42</xref>]. <italic>rpoB</italic> was significantly upregulated in the white panicle branch in <italic>wpb1</italic> relative to the green panicle branch in NIP. Moreover, in line with this result, the expression of the gene in the white branched F<sub>2</sub> plant was also significantly upregulated. It is worthy to note that <italic>rpoA</italic>, <italic>V1</italic> and <italic>V2</italic> were all downregulated in <italic>wpb1</italic>, whereas, in contrast, they were upregulated in the white branched F<sub>2</sub> plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223228.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of the photosynthesis&#8208;associated plastid genes, <italic>Cab1R</italic> and <italic>Cab2R</italic> (encoding light harvesting Chl a/b binding protein of PSII), <italic>psaA</italic> and <italic>psbA</italic> (encoding polypeptides of two different photosystems: PSI and PSII) were significantly suppressed in the <italic>wpb1</italic> and white panicled F<sub>2</sub> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223228.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the expression of Chl biosynthesis genes (<italic>HEMA1</italic>, <italic>CAO1</italic>, <italic>PORA</italic>), chloroplast development-associated genes (<italic>V1</italic>, <italic>V2</italic>, <italic>rpoA</italic>, <italic>rpoB</italic>) and photosynthesis genes (<italic>Cab1R</italic>, <italic>Cab2R</italic>, <italic>psaA</italic>, <italic>psbA</italic>) in <italic>wpb1</italic> were significantly different from those in NIP. Both Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis genes were significantly downregulated or severely inhibited. In addition, the gene <italic>rpoB</italic> for chloroplast development, was significantly upregulated, while <italic>V1</italic> and <italic>rpoA</italic> were downregulated in <italic>wpb1</italic> plants. These results indicated that the processes of chloroplast development, chlorophyll synthesis, and photosynthesis in branches of <italic>wpb1</italic> were severely altered by the mutation of <italic>wpb1</italic>.</p>
<p>Although the expression patterns of the related genes were not completely consistent between F<sub>2</sub> plants and their parents, they exhibited the similar trend of expression alterations between F<sub>2</sub> plants and their parents except <italic>rpoA</italic>, <italic>V1</italic>, and <italic>V2</italic> genes. For example, the differences in the expression of photosynthesis-associated genes between white panicle branches and green panicle branches in F<sub>2</sub> plants was in agreement well with the case between <italic>wpb1</italic> and NIP.</p>
<p>Therefore, we infer that the wpb1 gene may involve in the regulation pathway of the chlorophyll biosynthesis, chloroplast development, and photosynthesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Photosynthesis is an important biochemical reaction in higher plants. Normal chloroplast biogenesis in leaves of plants is of extremely important for photosynthesis. The defect in chloroplast development leads to tissue chlorosis or albinism. Thus far, many rice albino mutants have been reported in previous studies, mainly including leaf albino, seedling albino and panicle albino mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref047">47</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref053">53</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic>al4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref054">54</xref>], <italic>al8</italic>, <italic>as11</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref055">55</xref>], and <italic>asl3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref056">56</xref>] genes lead to leaf and seedling albinism. <italic>wlp1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref029">29</xref>], <italic>wlp2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref051">51</xref>], and <italic>wp3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref057">57</xref>] mutants exhibited panicle and glume albinism. Most of these mutants are unable to complete their life cycle, although a few of them can grow up under a specific environment. Most of these albino mutations result from defects in chloroplast development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref057">57</xref>], which is the same as <italic>wpb1</italic>.</p>
<p>In this study, a natural mutant with albino branches was found from a tropical japonica rice variety <italic>wpb1</italic>. The key feature of the phenotype that appeared in <italic>wpb1</italic> was white panicle branches without chloroplasts, and no additional abnormal coloration was observed in other parts of the rice plants. Genetic analysis showed that <italic>wpb1</italic> was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. Whole genome resequencing and BSA analysis were combined to preliminarily map the candidate interval for <italic>wpb1</italic>. Two intervals located on chromosome 1 and chromosome 3 were targeted as <italic>wpb1</italic> candidates. Further, the one on chromosome 3 was excluded from the 40k SNP array analysis. Subsequently, by map-based cloning, <italic>wpb1</italic> was narrowed down to a 95-kb interval flanked by M8 and M10 on chromosome 1 with 17 predicted genes in this region.</p>
<p>Several non-allelic genes with similar phenotypes have been cloned. The cloned <italic>wp1</italic> gene, which is located on chromosome 7 and encodes a Val-tRNA synthetase (OsValRS2) with a single base changed, leads to albino phenotypes in seedlings and white panicles at heading stage. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref023">23</xref>]. This mutant appears to have green leaves and glumes, green branches and spike axes. The development of seedlings with severe albinism was arrested and seedlings died at the 4-leaf stage. All observations above showed that there was an obvious difference in the branch colour phenotype between the <italic>wpb1</italic> and <italic>wp1</italic> mutants. However, the responses of the albino phenotypes to temperature change in the two mutants were similar. The two mutants showed aggravated albinism and a widened range of albino parts under low temperature. Another temperature-responsive albino mutant, <italic>wlp2</italic>, exhibited light green leaves and panicles in rice when the temperature was below 22&#176;C. With increasing temperature (22&#8211;32&#176;C), the albino phenotype appeared and aggravated significantly, resulting in the death of the rice plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref051">51</xref>]. The differences in albino phenotype between <italic>wlp2</italic> mutant and <italic>wpb1</italic> were also identified, such as the albino tissue, degree, and temperature response.</p>
<p>Li et al. cloned the <italic>WP3</italic> that was related to the albino panicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref057">57</xref>]. The location of <italic>wp3</italic> gene is close to the <italic>wpb1</italic> interval on chromosome 1. <italic>wpb1</italic> is located at 14-Kb upstream of <italic>WP3</italic> (Os01g0306650). Both mutants showed albino panicles and albino streaked leaves; however, the differences between two genotypes were obvious. First, the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant showed uniform albinism for the whole panicle and milky albinism (light green) throughout the panicle, with albino seedling. Furthermore, the variations are not observed in the coding sequences of the allele of <italic>WP3</italic> gene between Nipponbare and <italic>wpb1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223228.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The <italic>wpb1</italic> mutant in this study showed branch albinism (complete albino), while albinism in the panicle rachis and glume shell were regulated by temperature. Albinism in the <italic>wpb1</italic> mutant could extend from the panicle branch to the panicle rachis and glume shell with the decreasing of temperature (18&#8211;25&#176;C). Second, no whitening phenotypes were observed in <italic>wpb1</italic> at the seedling stage. Finally, the albinism of streaked leaves in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant shows maternal inheritance. The phenotype is not co-segregated with branch albino in <italic>wp3</italic> plants. Whereas, <italic>wpb1</italic> is a pleiotropic recessive nuclear gene with multiple effects for controlling the phenotypes of albino streaked leaf and albino panicles in <italic>wpb1</italic> mutant. Therefore, we inferred that the <italic>wpb1</italic> gene was a novel gene resulting in the albinism of rice panicle branches and white streaked leaves in rice.</p>
<p>The expression analysis showed the altered expressions of the genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, chloroplast development, and the photosynthesis system, suggesting that the mutation of <italic>WPB1</italic> might directly or indirectly impair the processes of chloroplast development and/or chlorophyll formation, and thereby resulting in the albino panicle branch phenotype of the variety. The expressions of chlorophyll synthesis genes in <italic>wpb1</italic> were significantly downregulated, while their expressions in the white and green branches of F<sub>2</sub> plants were not extremely induced. We speculated that the complicated recombinant events that occurred in F<sub>2</sub> plants led to the discrepancy in the expression of chlorophyll biosynthesis-related genes between parental lines and their offspring. However, these discrepancies were unable to significantly affect the appearance of the branch albino phenotype in offspring with a homozygous recessive <italic>wpb1</italic> gene. At the same time, the fact that the white streak leaves observed in the (NIP&#215;<italic>wpb1</italic>) F<sub>2</sub> generation only appeared in some but not all of the white panicle branched plants is noteworthy; in contrast, the white streak leaf phenotype and white branches were completely co-segregated in the BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub> population. We proposed that the white panicle branch and white streaked leaves were controlled by the same gene in the BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub> backcross population. Additional genes with synergistic/inhibited interaction that can reduce/eliminate or aggravate white streaks in leaves to a certain extent in F<sub>2</sub> plants were lost in selecting backcrosses. Therefore, <italic>wpb1</italic> deserves more focus in our further studies.</p>
<p>In spite of many research works have been done on the biogenesis of chloroplasts, the mechanism of chloroplast development remains elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0223228.ref058">58</xref>]. Albino mutants provide excellent materials for exploring the mechanism underlying the development of chloroplast. Therefore, the study of the mutant <italic>wpb1</italic> is of great significance. Further cloning and in-depth functional analysis of the <italic>wpb1</italic> gene will help to understand the regulatory mechanism of chloroplast development in rice branches. For the application of this genetic material, the underlying gene <italic>wpb1</italic> can be transformed into two-line male sterile lines as a colour marker for field trial investigation, which is used to prevent and eliminate the confusion to ensure hybrid purity in the breeding of two-line materials and in the seed production of hybrid rice.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: The linkage map of wpg1 gene was constructed and it was demonstrated that the 17 genes were predicted within candidate gene region on the chromosome. It was inferred the cause gene corresponding to wpg1 mutation functions the chloroplast development by the expression analysis of some genes and microscopy analyses. These analyses and the discussion can be appreciated.</p>
<p>However, this reviewer has the questions about the following points.</p>
<p>-P13, line 14-16</p>
<p>It is described as &#8220;The results suggested that the mutation of WPB1 severely impairs chloroplast development, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and photosynthesis in the panicle branches of wpb1&#8221;. The reason why &#8220;the wpb1 gene may involve in the regulation pathway of the chloroplast development&#8221; only by the results of enzyme activity should be explained.</p>
<p>-Annotation list of the predicted gene</p>
<p>Annotation list of the predicted genes shown in Fig3C and TableS3 should be shown. After that, the function of the candidate genes regulating the chloroplast development should be explained. Even when it is difficult to discuss by only annotation of gene, the authors should refer to the effect.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Comments:</p>
<p>1. P4, Ln3-4:the sentence "Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) is a rapid method for locating target trait genes in lettuce" is not very suitable, it can be modified to "Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) is a rapid method for locating target trait genes and it was initially used in lettuce".</p>
<p>2.P16, Ln12-22, the authors concluded wpb1 and wp3 not the same locates due to their different genotype. however, wpb1 is very nearby to wp3 (14 kb). So it had better to detect whether the sequence of wp3(Os01g0306650) are different in wbp1 mutant and nipponbare, and the candidate recombiant lines.</p>
<p>3. P16, ln23-24: While the albino streaked leaf of wpb1 is controlled by the same recessive nuclear gene. the sentence is obscure. it had better modifed to "Whereas the phenotypes of albino streaked leaf and albino panicles of wpb1 are controlled by the same recessive nuclear gene. on the other hand, the authors cannot conclude albino streaked leaf and albino panicles of wpb1 is controled by the same gene at present. whether wpb1 is one gene with multiple effects?</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Hope you are doing well!</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate for your kindly and helpful suggestions to our manuscript entitled &#8216;Genetic analysis and fine mapping of a qualitative trait locus wpb1 for albino panicle branches in rice&#8217;. We carefully revised the manuscript according to the comments, and now resubmit revised manuscript for your consideration. In the revised version, all detailed revisions were described in &#8216;Point-by-point response to reviewers&#8217; shown below for the convenience of you viewing.</p>
<p>We think the current version of this manuscript would have been significantly improved after revision. </p>
<p>Thanks again and any further suggestions to our manuscript from you will be highly appreciated and we are very grateful for your kind consideration for publication.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Point-by-point response to reviewers</p>
<p>We thank the Editor and Reviewers for insightful comments, which help us to substantially revise the manuscript.</p>
<p>In the current version of manuscript, we made some revisions according to the comments, including English language editing, supplemented Tables, and adjusted the description of the related content for more readability.</p>
<p>1. For the S3 Table, according to the comment of Reviewer 1, we added annotation information for the genes. Added S4 Table to list the annotation information of genes in wpb1 interval.</p>
<p>2. The genetic information between wpb1 and WP3 was added to clarify their relationship more clearly in the discussion according to the comment of Reviewer 2. P16, line 3.</p>
<p>3. Reviewers&#8217; suggestions for several descriptions were adopted for more readability.</p>
<p>Notes: Based on the guideline of editorial office, all the revisions were highlighted with red color for any Changes except the deletions in the revised manuscript. All the detailed revisions to the manuscript were described in this section.</p>
<p>4. We added sentence &#8220;Furthermore, the variations are not observed in the coding sequences of the allele of WP3 gene between Nipponbare and wpb1 mutant (S4 Fig).&#8221; to the discussion section to describe no sequence difference was observed in the coding sequences of wp3 gene in two parents, Nipponbare and wpb1 and supplemented with a supplementary figure, S4 Fig (P16, L14-16). Figure legend was supplemented at P22, L36-37. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: The linkage map of wpg1 gene was constructed and it was demonstrated that the 17 genes were predicted within candidate gene region on the chromosome. It was inferred the cause gene corresponding to wpg1 mutation functions the chloroplast development by the expression analysis of some genes and microscopy analyses. These analyses and the discussion can be appreciated.</p>
<p>However, this reviewer has the questions about the following points.</p>
<p>-P13, line 14-16</p>
<p>It is described as &#8220;The results suggested that the mutation of WPB1 severely impairs chloroplast development, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and photosynthesis in the panicle branches of wpb1&#8221;. The reason why &#8220;the wpb1 gene may involve in the regulation pathway of the chloroplast development&#8221; only by the results of enzyme activity should be explained.</p>
<p>Reply: Thank you for your careful reading and great comment! As you pointed out, it is inappropriate to infer that &#8220;the wpb1 gene may involve in the regulation pathway of the chloroplast development&#8221; only by the results of enzyme activity. The results of this experiment show that all three biological processes are abnormal at transcriptional level, and it is not clear which process is directly affected. So, we revised as a concise sentence: &#8216;Therefore, we infer that the wpb1 gene may involve in the regulation pathway of the chlorophyll biosynthesis, chloroplast development, and photosynthesis.&#8217; (P13, line5-6, revised manuscript)</p>
<p>-Annotation list of the predicted gene</p>
<p>Annotation list of the predicted genes shown in Fig3C and S3 Table should be shown. After that, the function of the candidate genes regulating the chloroplast development should be explained. Even when it is difficult to discuss by only annotation of gene, the authors should refer to the effect.</p>
<p>Reply: According to your suggestions, we have strengthened the analysis in this field. But, no annotated information and literature about these genes involved in albinism, chloroplast development, chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis were obtained. So, we did not predict specific genes, only added annotation information in S3 Table, and added S4 Table to list annotation information of genes in wpb1 interval. The citation in the text was made in the corresponding places for S4 Table (P11, line16, revised manuscript).</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Comments:</p>
<p>1. P4, Ln3-4:the sentence "Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) is a rapid method for locating target trait genes in lettuce" is not very suitable, it can be modified to "Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) is a rapid method for locating target trait genes and it was initially used in lettuce".</p>
<p>Reply: It was significantly improved after your revision for the sentence. Thank you! </p>
<p>(P4, line2-3, revised manuscript)</p>
<p>2.P16, Ln12-22, the authors concluded wpb1 and wp3 not the same locates due to their different genotype. however, wpb1 is very nearby to wp3 (14 kb). So it had better to detect whether the sequence of wp3(Os01g0306650) are different in wbp1 mutant and nipponbare, and the candidate recombiant lines. </p>
<p>Reply: According to your suggestion, we sequenced the CDS sequences of WP3 and did a sequence analysis between wpb1 mutant and nipponbare. The variations were not observed in the two coding sequences of Wp3 alleles in Nipponbare and wpb1 mutant (S4 Fig).</p>
<p>3. P16, ln23-24: While the albino streaked leaf of wpb1 is controlled by the same recessive nuclear gene. the sentence is obscure. it had better modifed to "Whereas the phenotypes of albino streaked leaf and albino panicles of wpb1 are controlled by the same recessive nuclear gene. on the other hand, the authors cannot conclude albino streaked leaf and albino panicles of wpb1 is controled by the same gene at present. whether wpb1 is one gene with multiple effects?</p>
<p>Reply: Thank you for your careful reading and excellent revision. Yes, the wpb1 is one gene with multiple effects, white panicle branch and albino streaked leaf.</p>
