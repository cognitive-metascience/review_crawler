<title>Background</title>
<p>Numerous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were conducted to evaluate dolutegravir based triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to other triple antiretroviral regimens in na&#239;ve patients, and a summary of the available evidence is required to shed more light on safety and effectiveness issues.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing dolutegravir-containing ART to non-dolutegravir containing ART in HIV-infected naive patients. Primary outcomes: % of patients with viral load&lt;50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, stratified according to baseline viral load levels (&lt; or &gt;100.000 copies/mL); overall rate of discontinuation and/or switching for any cause (virologic failure, clinical failure, adverse events).

</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We included 7 RCTs (13 reports, 6407patients) comparing dolutegravir containing to non-dolutegravir containing ART, both in combination with 2 NRTIs. Controls were raltegravir or bictegravir (3 RCTs), boosted atazanavir or darunavir (2 RCTs) or efavirenz (2 RCTs). Rates of patients with VL &lt;50 copies/ml were higher in dolutegravir recipients compared to controls at 48 weeks (RD, 0.05; 95% CIs, 0.03/0.08, p = 0.0002) and 96 weeks (RD, 0.06; 95% CIs, 0.03/0.10, p&lt;0.0001); the average benefit of using dolutegravir was particularly evident at 48 weeks in the subgroup of patients with high baseline viral load (RD, 0.10; 95% CIs, 0.05/0.15; p&lt; 0.0001; GRADE assessment: "high certainty of evidence"). Overall rate of discontinuation were lower in dolutegravir compared to controls (RD,-0.03, 95% CIs -0.05/-0.01; p = 0.007). No significant differences were observed in rates of discontinuation due to adverse events (RD, -0.02; 95% CIs, -0.05/0.00), virologic failure (RD, -0.01; 95% CIs, -0.02/0.01), and most common adverse events (GRADE assessment: from &#8220;very-low&#8221; to &#8220;moderate certainty of evidence&#8221;)</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Starting treatment in naive patients with dolutegravir containing ART has an increased likelihood of achieving viral suppression in the comparison with non-dolutegravir containing ART. The average benefit is particularly evident in those with high baseline viral load.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has made human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection a chronic manageable disease for many patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref001">1</xref>]. Individuals taking ART have now a wide range of therapeutic options and good prospects for long term survival. The current standard of care for HIV treatment is a three-drug regimen containing a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a protease inhibitor (PI), or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) plus two nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), usually abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or either tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF/FTC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref002">2</xref>]. Despite the undeniable success of antiretroviral therapy, limitations to safety and efficacy still persist. Moreover, in patients with baseline viral loads of greater than 100,000 copies/mL a slower rate of achieving viral suppression has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Due to their favorable side effect profile, limited drug-drug interactions, and virologic potency, INSTI-based regimens are now among the recommended and preferred first-line ART for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ART-na&#239;ve patients (a person with HIV who has never taken ART). Dolutegravir is a new-generation INSTI with distinct advantages compared with other available antiretroviral agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref004">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref007">7</xref>]. On the basis of data from in vitro studies and clinical trials in ART-naive patients, it is anticipated that, like dolutegravir, bictegravir has a high barrier to resistance. However, clinical data and experience with bictegravir are relatively limited at this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>To assess the efficacy and safety of the combined ARTcontaining dolutegravir relative to other ART regimens not containing dolutegravir in na&#239;ve patients, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis</p>

<title>Material and methods</title>
<p>This review has been conducted according to the PRISMA statement for the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref008">8</xref>]. A protocol has been registered in PROSPERO, the prospective register of systematic reviews (Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42018104938" ns0:type="simple">http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42018104938</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Search</title>
<p>The PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched (up to April 2019) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating efficacy and/or safety of DTG, EVG/c, RAL,BIC, ATV/r, DRV/r, EFV or RPV in treatment-naive HIV-1 patients. PubMed and EMBASE search terms were &#8216;&#8216;HIV-1 [mesh] OR HIV infections [mesh] AND ((dolutegravir OR GSK1349572) OR (efavirenz OR Sustiva OR Stocrin OR DMP-266) OR (raltegravir OR Isentress OR MK-0518) OR (elvitegravir OR GS-9137 OR JTK-303) OR (bictegravir OR GS-9883) OR (rilpivirine OR Edurant OR TMC 278) OR (darunavir OR Prezista OR TMC-114) OR (atazanavir OR Reyataz OR BMS-232632) OR (Atripla OR Quad OR Stribild OR Eviplera OR Complera))</p>
<p>We also searched reference lists of identified studies and major reviews, abstracts of conference proceedings, scientific meetings and clinical trials registries(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/" ns0:type="simple">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Data extraction</title>
<p>The two authors independently extracted data from the selected trials using standardized data extraction form. Agreement on the final assessment for each criterion was achieved by discussion. The following data were extracted: details of participants (number, setting, baseline characteristics by group), details of the study (study design; type and duration of follow up), details of ART regimen used, primary and secondary outcome descriptions and outcomes measures, number of withdrawals in each group with reasons. Data at 48 and 96 weeks were considered.</p>

<title>Assessment of risk of bias and heterogeneity</title>
<p>We explored clinical heterogeneity (eg study setting, characteristics of participants) and assessed statistical heterogeneity using Tau<sup>2</sup>, Cochran&#8217;s Q and estimated this using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic, which examines the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than to chance (I<sup>2</sup> &#8804;25 suggest low heterogeneity; I<sup>2</sup> &gt;50, high heterogeneity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref009">9</xref>]. The risk of bias of each included study is assessed following the domain-based evaluation described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref010">10</xref>]. The Cochrane &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; tool addresses six specific domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete data, selective outcome reporting, and other issues relating to bias. We have presented our assessment of risk of bias using two &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; summary figures: 1) a summary of bias for each item across all studies; and 2) a cross-tabulation of each trial by all of the &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; item.</p>
<p>We used the principles of the GRADE (The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system to assess the quality of the body of evidence associated with specific outcomes, and constructed a &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table using the software Review Manager, version 5.3 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://community.cochrane.org/help/tools-and-software/revman-5/revman-5-download" ns0:type="simple">https://community.cochrane.org/help/tools-and-software/revman-5/revman-5-download</ext-link>). The certainty of a body of evidence involves consideration of within-trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates, and risk of publication bias. To inspect for publication bias visually we generated graphical funnel plots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref011">11</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Strategy for data synthesis</title>
<p>We used aggregate data. The analysis was conducted on an "intention to treat" approach. Quantitative synthesis was used if the included studies were sufficiently homogenous.</p>
<p>When <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> <italic>values were</italic> = 0, studies were pooled using a fixed-effect model. Where values of <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> are greater than zero, both fixed and random effects analyses were performed and any differences in estimates of treatment effect considered. The fixed effect model was also considered as a sensitivity analysis for evaluating the possible bias effects of smaller studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored by pre-specified subgroup analysis. We used risk difference as measure of effect. Review Manager 5.3 was used to analyze the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec015">
<title>Analysis of subgroups or subsets</title>
<p>We anticipated clinical heterogeneity in the effect of the intervention and we conducted, where possible, the following sub-group analyses:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Virologic efficacy of dolutegravir and comparators analyzed according to baseline VL (eg, &lt; 100,000 copies/ml or &gt;100,000 copies/ml)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Efficacy and safety data of dolutegravir analyzed according to the control intervention (eg, vs PI, vs NNRTI, or vs other INSTI).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When sufficient trials were identified, we conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing the results using all trials as follow:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>those RCTs with high methodological quality (studies classified as having a 'low risk of bias' versus those identified as having a 'high risk of bias');</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Those RCTs that performed intention-to treat versus per-protocol analyses.</p></list-item>

<title>Risk of bias in selected studies</title>
<p>Summary graphs of methodological quality items are presented in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222229.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222229.g003">3</xref>. All the included studies were judged at low risk of selection, attrition and reporting bias. Three of the included studies were open-label, and we judged this domain as "high risk" of bias for these studies (ARIA, Flamingo, SPRING-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref020">20</xref>]; however, masking probably has limited importance for more objective outcomes (as the virologic outcomes), because the risk of ascertainment bias is limited. We made a judgment of "low risk of bias" for the remaining studies defined as double-blind. We judged the masking of outcome assessor to treatment allocation at "low risk" of bias for 4 studies in which the assessment was performed by someone not involved in the study (GS 1489, GS1490, SINGLE, SPRING-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref014">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref021">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref024">24</xref>], and at unclear risk of bias for the remaining 3 studies where it was unclear if adequate measures were taken to ensure that the assessors were unaware of treatment allocation. Although all the included studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, our evaluation showed that they were of high methodological quality and also excluded the presence of other biases that cannot be explained by standard &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; assessments (eg, deficiencies in the definition of patient-relevant endpoints, selection of suitable substances for the control arm, evidence of publication bias); moreover, the protocol of these studies were registered on international registers of clinical trials (clinicalTrials.gov) and results publicly available. Therefore we made a judgment of &#8220;low risk of bias&#8221; for the domain &#8220;other bias.</p>

<p>Protocol- defined virologic failure (generally defined as two consecutive HIV-1 RNA values of at least 50 copies/mL) occurred rarely both in dolutegravir and controls groups (2.5 and 3.3%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222229.t002">Table 2</xref>). No geno-phenotypic mutation were recorded among dolutegravir recipients; in the control groups, few NNRTI and/or NRTI mutations were recorded in 3 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref018">18</xref>]. Notably, in the SPRING-2 study one patient in the raltegravir group with baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA of more than 3 million copies/ mL developed both integrase-resistant and NRTI-resistant mutations; phenotype resistance at virologic failure showed a raltegravir fold-change of 34 and a dolutegravir fold-change of 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref018">18</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>For the treatment of HIV infected naive patients current guidelines endorse an ARV regimen generally consisting of two NRTI administered in combination with a third active ARV drug from one of three drug classes: INSTI, NNRTI, or boosted PI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref025">25</xref>]. For most patients, initial therapy should be with two NRTIs combined with an INSTI; in some individuals, a combination of an NNRTI or boosted PI should be considered. Basing on recent guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV, &#8220;the choice between an INSTI, PI, or NNRTI as the third drug in an initial ARV regimen should be guided by the regimen&#8217;s efficacy, barrier to resistance, adverse effects profile, convenience, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and the potential for drug-drug interactions&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref002">2</xref>]. Dolutegravir in combination with NRTIs is one of the recommended regimens in antiretroviral therapy-na&#239;ve patients, but others INSTI, such as raltegravir and, more recently, bictegravir, can be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref025">25</xref>]. In clinical trials, these INSTI-containing regimens were highly effective and have relatively infrequent adverse effects and few drug interactions. In several head-to-head comparisons between boosted PI-containing regimens and INSTI-containing regimens, the INSTI was better tolerated and caused fewer treatment discontinuations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref026">26</xref>]. On the basis of data from in vitro studies and clinical trials in ART-naive patients, it is anticipated that, like dolutegravir, bictegravir has a high barrier to resistance. However, clinical data and experience with bictegravir are relatively limited right now [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref002">2</xref>]. Although the success of ART is beyond question, several issues related to safety and efficacy still persist. Pre-treatment viral load level is an important factor in the selection of an initial antiretroviral regimen because several antiretroviral drug regimens have been associated with poorer responses and slower rate of achieving viral suppression in patients with high baseline VL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref003">3</xref>].<sup>.</sup></p>
<p>Numerous RCTs were conducted to evaluate dolutegravir containing ART compared to other ART regimens in na&#239;ve patients, and these have been the objectives of systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref027">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref030">30</xref>]. Since then, however, new evidence is accumulating, and a new review is required to shed more light on safety and effectiveness issues related to ART regimens containing or not dolutegravir.</p>
<p>In this systematic review we have included seven primary studies, corresponding to 13 reports, evaluating the efficacy and safety of ART regimens containing dolutegravir or others core agents (PIs, NNRTI or other INSTI), both in combination with a dual nucleoside backbone (TDF/FTC, TAF/FTC or ABC/3TC) in na&#239;ve patients. Bias assessment using Cochrane methodology showed that the studies analyzed had few methodological limitations. Only four of the seven included studies were blind. However, the primary outcome of the analysis and its measurement (viral load) is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; on the other hand, blinding could have been important for assessment of subjective outcomes such as adverse events.</p>
<p>The primary endpoint of the included studies was the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA concentration lower than 50 copies/ ml. Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate convincing evidence that starting ART with dolutegravir in na&#239;ve patients has important clinical implications. Actually, we observe an increased likelihood (+5%; 95% CIs, +3/+8%) of achieving VL&lt;50 copies/ml at 48 weeks compared to the alternative agents (boosted atazanavir or darunavir, efavirenz, raltegravir or bictegravir). The average benefit is particularly evident (+10%; 95%CIs, +5%/+15%) in the subgroup of patients with high baseline VL: in this subgroup of patients the superior activity of dolutegravir is consistent for the comparison with other INSTI (+8%; 95% CIs, +1/+14%) and with boosted PIs (+20%; 95% CIs, +10/+30%). Basing on GRADE assessment, all these comparisons were graded as "high certainty of evidence". An assessment of high-certainty evidence means that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimates of the effect. At 96 weeks dolutegravir recipients still had higher proportion of undetectable viremia (+ 6%; 95% CIs, +3/+10%) compared to controls (efavirenz, darunavir, bictegravir or raltegravir) (moderate certainty of evidence due to heterogeneity).Overall rate of discontinuation and/or switching for any cause (virologic failure, clinical failure, adverse events) at 48 weeks were lower in dolutegravir group compared to controls (-3%; 95% CIs, -5/-1%) (high certainty of evidence).</p>
<p>Data on adverse events (any adverse events, adverse events requiring discontinuation, most common adverse events) produced low or very low certainty evidence, due to imprecision, heterogeneity and/or risk of bias in open label studies. An assessment of low-certainty evidence means that our confidence in the effect estimate is limited, and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. There were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of any adverse events, adverse events requiring discontinuation and most common adverse events in dolutegravir group compared to controls, in the overall analysis and in the analysis of double-blind studies only. Most common adverse events reported in both groups were nausea, diarrhea, insomnia and psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Protocol- defined virologic failure occurred rarely both in dolutegravir and controls groups. Notably, in trials included in the current review no geno-phenotypic mutations and mutations that confer dolutegravir resistance have been recorded, which suggests that dolutegravir, like bictegravir, has a higher barrier to resistance than raltegravir and elvitegravir. Resistance to dolutegravir and bictegravir has not been reported in clinical trials when these drugs are used as part of initial triple-drug ART, and only rarely in treatment-experienced patients receiving a dolutegravir-containing regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref031">31</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref033">33</xref>]. Combinations of INSTI resistance mutations selected by prolonged exposure to raltegravir or elvitegravir in the setting of treatment failure can, however, result in cross-resistance to dolutegravir and bictegravir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref034">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>In all the included studies, the experimental intervention was compared to an established standard-of-care treatment, as endorsed by current guidelines. Dolutegravir and comparators were administered with fixed-dose combination of TDF/FTC, or TAF/FTC, or ABC/3TC Screening for hypersensitivity reaction was performed in all the studies included in the current review, with the exception of one study where TAF/FTC was the only NRTI combination administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222229.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>The strenghts of the current systematic review is that it address timely and relevant clinical question, such as that related to the virologic efficacy of ART regimens in na&#239;ve patients according to baseline VL levels, and includes studies which were not included in previously published reviews and meta analyses. The limitation is that health outcome measures of quality of life were rarely reported in the included studies, and we could not assess treatment satisfaction.</p>
<p>In summary, we found high quality evidence related to the higher virologic efficacy of dolutegravir-containing ART compared to other non-dolutegravir containing ART in na&#239;ve patients. For other outcomes such as occurrence of adverse events the available evidence is not conclusive. Although the randomized clinical trial setting would provide the least biased approach to assessing outcomes, blinded outcome assessment is crucial for outcomes such as adverse events, which are inherently subjective. Not all the included studies were blinded, so the risk of detection or observer bias cannot be excluded.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Starting treatment in naive patients with dolutegravir containing ART has an increased likelihood of achieving viral suppression in the comparison with non-dolutegravir containing ART. The average benefit is particularly evident in those with high baseline VL (eg, &gt;100,000 copies/ml), and it is consistent in trials comparing dolutegravir to other INSTI or to boosted PIs.</p>

<p>3. We note that you have included the phrase &#8220;data not shown&#8221; in your manuscript. Unfortunately, this does not meet our data sharing requirements. PLOS does not permit references to inaccessible data. We require that authors provide all relevant data within the paper, Supporting Information files, or in an acceptable, public repository. Please add a citation to support this phrase or upload the data that corresponds with these findings to a stable repository (such as Figshare or Dryad) and provide and URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers that may be used to access these data. Or, if the data are not a core part of the research being presented in your study, we ask that you remove the phrase that refers to these data.</p>
<p>4. Please confirm that you have included all items recommended in the PRISMA checklist including an assessment of publication bias using graphical methods (e.g. Funnel plot) and statistical methods (e.g. Egger&#8217;s test) as appropriate; details of reasons for study exclusions in the PRISMA flowchart and number of studies excluded for each reason; and the full electronic search strategy used to identify studies with all search terms and limits for at least one database.</p>
<p>5. We noticed you have some minor occurrence of overlapping text with the following previous publication(s), which needs to be addressed:</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf" ns0:type="simple">https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf</ext-link></p>

<p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Partly</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: There are several mislabeled items in the plots. Please mention if the authors performed tests for multiplicity.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The Authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing dolutegravir-containing ART to non-dolutegravir containing ART in HIV-infected naive patients.The manuscript is well written and represents a very comprehensive analysis on this topic. The methodology is adequate and updated.</p>
<p>I have just one suggestion. Since the use of patients reported outcomes represent a more useful tool compared to clinician report of adverse events and they can explore outcomes such as patients' satisfaction with treatment, and considering the high virological response rates reported in some comparison between INSTI-based regimens in particular, it could be useful to include, when available, PROs as specific outcomes in the metanalysis (Whol, The Patient - Patient-Centered Outcomes Research, 2018).</p>

<p>Journal Requirements:</p>
<p>1. When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>AU: OK</p>
<p>2. Please include captions for your Supporting Information files at the end of your manuscript, and update any in-text citations to match accordingly. Please see our Supporting Information guidelines for more information: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information</ext-link>.</p>
<p>AU: OK</p>
<p>3. We note that you have included the phrase &#8220;data not shown&#8221; in your manuscript. Unfortunately, this does not meet our data sharing requirements. PLOS does not permit references to inaccessible data. We require that authors provide all relevant data within the paper, Supporting Information files, or in an acceptable, public repository. Please add a citation to support this phrase or upload the data that corresponds with these findings to a stable repository (such as Figshare or Dryad) and provide and URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers that may be used to access these data. Or, if the data are not a core part of the research being presented in your study, we ask that you remove the phrase that refers to these data.</p>
<p>AU: as suggested, we have removed the sentence, and specified that funnel plots were not performed because the low number of studies (lines 199-200)</p>
<p>4. Please confirm that you have included all items recommended in the PRISMA checklist including an assessment of publication bias using graphical methods (e.g. Funnel plot) and statistical methods (e.g. Egger&#8217;s test) as appropriate; details of reasons for study exclusions in the PRISMA flowchart and number of studies excluded for each reason; and the full electronic search strategy used to identify studies with all search terms and limits for at least one database.</p>
<p>AU: done</p>
<p>5. We noticed you have some minor occurrence of overlapping text with the following previous publication(s), which needs to be addressed:</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf" ns0:type="simple">https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/218/5/673/4956225" ns0:type="simple">https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/218/5/673/4956225</ext-link></p>
<p>The text that needs to be addressed is in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>AU:  The first sentence is from DHHS &#8220;the choice between an INSTI, PI, or NNRTI as the third drug in an initial ARV regimen should be guided by the regimen&#8217;s efficacy, barrier to resistance, adverse effects profile, convenience, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and the potential for drug-drug interactions&#8221; We have inserted the whole paragraph in brackets, and specified that the sentence is based on the DHHS guidelines</p>
<p>The second is &#8220;result in cross-resistance to dolutegravir and bictegravir. The reference you mention is now quoted (no. 36, Kuritzkes DR. Resistance to Dolutegravir&#8212;A Chink in the Armor? The Journal of Infectious Diseases,  2018, 218: 673&#8211;675)</p>
<p>In your revision ensure you cite all your sources (including your own works), and quote or rephrase any duplicated text outside the methods section. Further consideration is dependent on these concerns being addressed.</p>
<p>6.  Thank you for stating the following in the Competing Interests section:</p>
<p>MC has received honoraria as a speaker and/or advisor from  Abbott, Bayer, Cephalon, Gilead, Novartis and ViiV Healthcare, SGP  has received  research grants from Gilead Sciences, ViiV Healthcare, Abbott, MS&amp;D, and  honoraria as a speaker from MS&amp;D, Gilead Sciences, ViiV Healthcare, Abbvie, Janssen.

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: There are several mislabeled items in the plots. Please mention if the authors performed tests for multiplicity.</p>
<p>AU: as we have specified below (comments), we have made consistent legends of figures and graph. We did not perform tests for multiplicity</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The Authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing dolutegravir-containing ART to non-dolutegravir containing ART in HIV-infected naive patients.The manuscript is well written and represents a very comprehensive analysis on this topic. The methodology is adequate and updated.</p>
<p>I have just one suggestion. Since the use of patients reported outcomes represent a more useful tool compared to clinician report of adverse events and they can explore outcomes such as patients' satisfaction with treatment, and considering the high virological response rates reported in some comparison between INSTI-based regimens in particular, it could be useful to include, when available, PROs as specific outcomes in the metanalysis (Whol, The Patient - Patient-Centered Outcomes Research, 2018).</p>
<p>AU: Thank you for this interesting observation, Unfortunately, as we have now specified in lines 369-371, measures of quality of life were rarely reported in the included studies, and we could not assess treatment satisfaction.</p>

<p>Dolutegravir based antiretroviral therapy compared to other combined antiretroviral regimens for the treatment of HIV-infected naive patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis</p>
<p>Comments: </p>
<p>Define &#8220;na&#239;ve&#8221; in the Introduction</p>
<p>AU: Done (lineS 64-65)</p>
<p>There are only two authors. Was there an adjudicator in the data extraction process in case of disagreements?</p>
<p>AU: as specified on lines 110-111, agreement was achieved by discussion</p>
<p>90 Assessment of risk of bias and Heterogeneity</p>
<p>Below line 90</p>
<p>Put here gradings of heterogeneity as in I2 = 0% indicating no heterogeneity</p>
<p>AU: Actually, the interpretation of I2 values is more complicated, and can be misleading; often, threshold of interpretation are: &#8804;25, low heterogeneity; &gt;50, high heterogeneity (now specified in the text, line 94), but these values are completely arbitrary. So, as for other systematic reviews of our groups, we decided to use fixed effect model when I2 =0 and when values of I&#178; are greater than zero, both fixed and random effects analyses were performed (see sentences on line 140-2 &#8220;We used the fixed-effect model when the  I2 was=0,&#8230;.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Restrict mentioning RevMan more than twice</p>
<p>AU: REV MAN is mentioned on line 132 and 145</p>
<p>Did the authors perform tests for heterogeneity? </p>
<p>AU: yes (see lines 118-121)</p>
<p>Strategy for data synthesis</p>
<p>104 We used aggregate data. The analysis has been conducted</p>
<p>Substitute the underlined with &#8220;was&#8221;</p>
<p>AU: done</p>
<p>107 random effects analyses are undertaken and any differences</p>
<p>Substitute the underlined with &#8220;performed&#8221;</p>
<p>AU: done</p>
<p>109 pre-specified subgroup analysis. We used risk difference as measure of effect. Review Manager 5.3 was used to analyze the data.</p>
<p>RevMan again?</p>
<p>AU: yes, for the second time</p>
<p>Table 2 . legend</p>
<p>Include RD</p>
<p>AU: done</p>
<p>203 adverse events and of adverse events requiring discontinuation of treatment was not significantly different in dolutegravir</p>
<p>What is the p-value for the &#8220;not significantly different &#8220;?</p>
<p>AU: the p values for any adverse events and adverse events requiring discontinuation have bee added to the text (line 273)</p>
<p>Kindly organize your Discussion so as to indicate summary of effects, clinical implications</p>
<p>Also mention of strengths and limitations of this study.</p>
<p>AU: summary effects and clinical implications are discussed (lines 321-348) and strengths and limits are now mentioned (lines 364-9)</p>
<p>156 Table 2 . Summary of the pooled outcome data. Results are provided for a 156 ll possible comparisons, and for</p>
<p>157 subgroups analyses</p>
<p>In column 5 of the P-values, the authors present several significant values</p>
<p>Did the authors correct for multiple comparisons?</p>
<p>AU: no, we did not.</p>
<p>The favours labels are opposite at the x-axis in Figures 3 and 5</p>
<p>Is this correct? </p>
<p>AU: yes, it is correct. In fig 4 thr RD is &gt;0, which means  that more people in DTG had VL&lt;50 copies, a favourable outcome resulting in effect estimates to the right of the vertical line. In fig. 5 the RD is less than 0, which means that less people in DTG has treatment discontinuation, a favourable outcome resulting in effect estimates to the left of the vertical line</p>
<p>Suppl figures 1 and 2</p>
<p>Need to label DTG in legend</p>
<p>AU: we have made consistent legends of figures and graphs,  using the entire words for dolutegravir and comparators</p>
<p>Supl Fig 4. Forest plot of comparison: DTG vs EFV, outcome: VL&lt;50 48 wks</p>
<p>SINGLE 48 contributed 57.7% to the pooled RD, mention this in the text because it is an imbalance in weight contribution</p>
<p>AU: this is now mentioned in the text (lines 236-7)</p>
<p>Supl Fig 5. Forest plot of comparison: Dolutegravir vs comparators, outcome: VL&lt;50 96 wks</p>
<p>The authors used random-effects here, why not fixed?</p>
<p>AU:because  I2=31, and we chosed, starting from the protocol,   to present the result of the  fixed effect model when I2 =0</p>
<p>Supl Fig 6. Forest plot of comparison: DTG vs other according to baseline CD4 (cut off 200 CD4/ml) ,</p>
<p>outcome: % &lt;50.</p>
<p>The authors used random-effects here even if the 9.3.1 plot is I2 = 0%. Please justify</p>
<p>AU: we used random effects model because in one of the subgroup there was evidence of heterogeneity; however, we performed analysis also using the fixed effect, and the results were much the same</p>
<p>Supl Fig 7. Forest plot of comparison: Dolutegravir vs comparators, outcome: Most common adverse</p>
<p>effects. Is the label favouring Dolutegravir same is DTG?</p>
<p>AU: as for fig 5, a RD &lt;0 is a favourable outcome for AE. The 95 % CIs cross the vertical line for all the outcome analyzed</p>
