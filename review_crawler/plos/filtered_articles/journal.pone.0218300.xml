<abstract>
<p>Dps proteins (DNA-binding proteins from starved cells) have been found to detoxify H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. At their catalytic centers, the ferroxidase center (FOC), Dps proteins utilize Fe<sup>2+</sup> to reduce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and therefore play an essential role in the protection against oxidative stress and maintaining iron homeostasis. Whereas most bacteria accommodate one or two Dps, there are five different Dps proteins in <italic>Nostoc punctiforme</italic>, a phototrophic and filamentous cyanobacterium. This uncommonly high number of Dps proteins implies a sophisticated machinery for maintaining complex iron homeostasis and for protection against oxidative stress. Functional analyses and structural information on cyanobacterial Dps proteins are rare, but essential for understanding the function of each of the NpDps proteins. In this study, we present the crystal structure of NpDps4 in its metal-free, iron- and zinc-bound forms. The FOC coordinates either two iron atoms or one zinc atom. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that NpDps4 could oxidize Fe<sup>2+</sup> utilizing O<sub>2</sub>, but no evidence for its use of the oxidant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could be found. We identified Zn<sup>2+</sup> to be an effective inhibitor of the O<sub>2</sub>-mediated Fe<sup>2+</sup> oxidation in NpDps4. NpDps4 exhibits a FOC that is very different from canonical Dps, but structurally similar to the atypical one from DpsA of <italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic>. Sequence comparisons among Dps protein homologs to NpDps4 within the cyanobacterial phylum led us to classify a novel FOC class: the His-type FOC. The features of this special FOC have not been identified in Dps proteins from other bacterial phyla and it might be unique to cyanobacterial Dps proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dps proteins (DNA-binding proteins from starved cells), also referred to as miniferritins, are only found in prokaryotes and belong to the class of ferritin-like proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref001">1</xref>], alongside with bacterioferritins (bfr) and ferritins (ftn). Dps proteins exhibit a remarkable three-dimensional structure consisting of twelve monomers (or six dimers), forming a spherically shaped protein complex with a hollow spherical interior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>On the inside, each dimeric interface forms two identical catalytic centers, called the ferroxidase centers (FOC). There, the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) to ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) takes place and an iron oxide mineral core consisting of up to 500 Fe atoms can be formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref004">4</xref>]. Canonical FOCs in Dps proteins consist of five conserved amino acids, namely two His and one Asp from one monomer as well as one Glu and one Asp from the adjacent monomer at the dimer interface.</p>
<p>To reach the catalytic center, the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions have been suggested to travel through two types of pores that are connecting the internal cavity with the exterior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref002">2</xref>]. One pore type is the ferritin-like pore, which is named after their structural similarity to the iron entrance pores in ferritins. The ferritin-like pore has been frequently assigned to be the iron entrance pore due to its negatively charged character in canonical Dps structures. The other pore type, the Dps-type pore, is specific to Dps proteins. Compared to the ferritin-like pore it has a more hydrophobic character and its function remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>When Fe<sup>2+</sup> has entered the Dps and bound to the FOC, it is usually oxidized by O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. However in canonical Dps proteins, O<sub>2</sub> is utilized at a 100-fold lower reaction rate as compared to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as demonstrated for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Dps (EcDps) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref006">6</xref>]. Due to the consumption of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> a mineral core is formed and the Fenton reaction is circumvented, from which in the absence of the Dps protein highly toxic hydroxyl radicals are produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Thus the Dps protein class joins the cellular protection machinery alongside catalases and peroxidases that disarm reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref009">9</xref>]. Cyanobacteria, which contain the O<sub>2</sub>-evolving photosynthetic apparatus, require an effective response to ROS, as O<sub>2</sub> is the precursor for all ROS including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref011">11</xref>]. The filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacterium <italic>Nostoc punctiforme</italic> ATTC 29133 exhibits a complex H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-protection system including three catalases and various peroxidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref012">12</xref>]. In addition to those, we have identified five Dps proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>In cyanobacteria the existence of multiple Dps proteins has been found to be rather common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref014">14</xref>], but most of the more well-studied Dps proteins originate from pathogens that possess only one or two Dps proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref015">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref017">17</xref>]. Information about cyanobacterial Dps proteins and their involvement in iron homeostasis and ROS defense is scarce. To learn specifically more about cyanobacterial Dps proteins, we have collected data on the different NpDps from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic> in the past years to identify their physiological roles. In an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref013">13</xref>] we hypothesized that, despite all belonging to the Dps protein family, they might differ in their biochemical properties and thus in their physiological function.</p>
<p>First we have identified that, with the exception of <italic>Npdps2</italic>, all the <italic>Npdps</italic> genes are predominantly transcribed in heterocysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref018">18</xref>], a specific cell type that is developed in a regular pattern along the filament during nitrogen depletion. In heterocysts a microoxic environment is created, necessitated by the oxygen sensitivity of the nitrogenase that is involved in N<sub>2</sub>-fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref019">19</xref>]. In an earlier <italic>in vivo</italic> study we additionally observed that NpDps2 (Npun_F3730) is an essential protectant against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that is exogenously added to the cyanobacterial culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref013">13</xref>]. Interestingly, biochemical investigations showed that NpDps1, NpDps2 and NpDps3 could catalyze the oxidation reaction of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but not with O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref020">20</xref>]. NpDps1-3 showed high sequence similarities with the canonical Dps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref020">20</xref>]. <italic>In silico</italic> experiments indicated that NpDps1-3 likely import Fe<sup>2+</sup> through their ferritin-like pores as commonly hypothesized for typical Dps proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref020">20</xref>]. Additionally we discovered that NpDps2 and NpDps5 (Npun_F6212), are involved in the tolerance against high light intensities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref021">21</xref>], a condition that enhances the production of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>The information about NpDps4 is limited and its role in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic> is not resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref013">13</xref>]. NpDps4 shares a sequence identity of circa 64% (based on the sequences derived by Cyanobase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref024">24</xref>] and alignment by Clustal Omega [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref025">25</xref>]) with the DpsA from the cyanobacterium <italic>Thermosynechoccus elongatus</italic> (TeDpsA). Notably, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>elongatus</italic> exhibits two Dps proteins, which are the only cyanobacterial Dps proteins that have been structurally studied so far. While TeDps was found to share high similarities with canonical Dps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref005">5</xref>], TeDpsA was found to be an atypical Dps. TeDpsA has been reported to exhibit surprisingly similar Fe<sup>2+</sup> oxidation rates with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, which was suggested to relate to Zn<sup>2+</sup> bound at the FOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref014">14</xref>]. Canonical FOCs are usually dominated by negatively charged carboxyl groups from various Glu and Asp among two conserved His [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref014">14</xref>]. Instead, the FOC of TeDpsA was found to have a non-canonical nature with two additional His and less involvement of carboxyl groups from Asp or Glu. Our sequence alignment revealed that NpDps4 may exhibit a similar FOC as the one from TeDpsA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref013">13</xref>]. Whether this type of FOC might be found among other cyanobacterial Dps has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>In this study we investigate the structural and biochemical properties of NpDps4 to gain insights on its physiological role in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic>. We gathered crystal structure data on NpDps4 in a metal-free, an iron-bound and zinc-bound form. Additionally, the purified protein was analyzed in a series of spectroscopic analyses to identify whether O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could be used for Fe<sup>2+</sup> oxidation under aerobic conditions. We further studied whether we could observe a similar effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on the enzymatic reaction as compared to TeDpsA. Finally, we reviewed our earlier phylogenetical data about Dps proteins, giving rise to the suggestion of a new classification of ferroxidase centers and a potentially new class of Dps proteins.</p>

<title>Structural compartments of the NpDps4 dodecamer and insight on metal ion trafficking</title>
<p>Dps crystal structures from more than 30 different bacteria have been determined since the Dps protein family was discovered in 1992 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref026">26</xref>]. Only two Dps structures originate from the cyanobacterial phylum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref014">14</xref>], while the major focus in the field has been on Dps from pathogens. In the following we show the crystal structure of NpDps4 from the cyanobacterium <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic>. The structural data gives insights into the overall multimerization, the pore structures and the FOC. We soaked the crystals in different metal ion solutions to identify possible metal binding sites. Such information can give insights on possible metal ion co-factors or inhibitors of the protein.</p>
<p>The overall structure of NpDps4 forms a dodecameric hollow sphere that is built up from identical monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218300.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Each monomer consists of 184 amino acids that form a four-helix bundle consisting of the helices A, B, C and D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218300.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). A small BC helix is integrated within the long loop that connects helix B and C. An N-terminal tail of 22 amino acids precedes helix A, and a C-terminal tail of 12 amino acids follows helix D. As twelve monomers build up the dodecamer, dimeric as well as trimeric sub-structures can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218300.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The dimer is formed by helices A and B from one monomer packing head-to-tail to the corresponding helices from a second monomer. In addition, the short BC helices from the two monomers run anti-parallel to each other and interact mainly by hydrophobic interactions promoted by the side chains of Phe95, Leu98 and Ala99 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218300.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>A pore is present at the trimeric interface, mainly formed by the short loops that link helices C and D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218300.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The formation of such a pore is a well-known feature of Dps proteins and is called a ferritin-like pore, since it is formed along a 3-fold axis, similar to the pores in ferritins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref027">27</xref>]. In the case of NpDps4, charged and aromatic residues from the three monomers line the ferritin-like pore. Each subunit of the trimer contributes symmetrical side chains of Glu140 facing the exterior of the pore, followed by Arg145, Arg148 and Glu152, which all form a network of hydrogen bonds. Tyr149 as well as Lys153 face the hollow interior of the Dps protein. There is a tight hydrogen bonding network between the residues that line the pore, leaving no room for bound water molecules or ions.</p>

<p>The NpDps4 structure was determined in three forms; metal-free, Fe-soaked and Zn-soaked. Except for the metal binding sites the three structures were very similar. A pairwise comparison between the equivalent subunits of the three proteins shows that root mean square deviation values (r. m. s. d.) vary between 0.16 and 0.23 &#197;. Due to the higher resolution of the metal-free NpDps4 more amino acids could be modelled in the N-terminus of each subunit: two additional residues in three of the subunits and eight in one subunit (including two from the linker). In addition, a double conformation of Cys103 is observed in metal-free Dps4 but not in the metal bound forms.</p>

<p>In the Fe<sup>2+</sup>-soaked crystals, which diffracted to 1.9 &#197;, two strong electron density peaks were found on the dimeric interface at the FOC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218300.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). According to canonical Dps nomenclature, usually two sites (site A and B) within the FOC have been assigned. The Fe atom at the A-site is coordinated by His78 and Glu82 from helix A from one monomer and His51 from helix B from a neighboring monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218300.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The Fe atom in site B is located only 3.5 &#197; from the Fe atom in site A and is coordinated by the same Glu82 from helix A, the His63 from helix B, and the His164 from a helix of a third monomer at coordination distance. In canonical FOCs usually a conserved negatively charged Asp or Glu at position 67 has been shown to participate in Fe coordination at site B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref029">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref031">31</xref>]. In NpDps4, the corresponding Asn67 is not participating in FOC formation, neither the adjacent Asp68 (not shown). Among different water molecules that were found in the coordination sphere of the Fe atoms one was found to coordinate to both Fe atoms at site A and B at distances of 2.2 &#197; and 2.3 &#197;, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218300.s004">S1 Table</xref>). The water molecule is not located on a straight line between the Fe atoms. The angle between the two Fe atoms and the bridging water molecule is 95&#176;. When the Fe<sup>2+</sup>-soaked structure was compared to the metal-free structure, a pronounced conformational change was observed. Both, Glu82 and His164 were tilted towards the metal atoms for better coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218300.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>In the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-soaked crystals, which diffracted to 2.4 &#197;, the A-site was occupied with a Zn atom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218300.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The Zn atom was coordinated by His78 and Glu82 from helix A and His51 from helix B, which were the same coordinating amino acids as for the Fe atom in site A. Also, here a pronounced conformational change can be observed for Glu82 for better coordination to the Zn atom. No conclusive information about a second metal could be derived for site B due to the limited resolution, however at some of the B-sites a low occupancy Zn atom could be indicated based on anomalous electron density maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218300.s002">S2 Fig</xref>.).

<title>NpDps4 utilizes O<sub>2</sub> to oxidize Fe<sup>2+</sup></title>
<p>Dps proteins catalyze the oxidation reaction of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> with O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, thereby forming an iron mineral core inside the protein cavity. The oxidant affinity towards H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is up to 100-fold greater as compared to O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref006">6</xref>]. The ability to consume H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during the oxidation has been shown to be of importance for cellular defenses against oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref033">33</xref>]. Our earlier results on the NpDps1-3 showed that none of these three proteins could catalyze the O<sub>2</sub>-mediated oxidation reaction, while H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acted as a good oxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>To investigate whether NpDps4 exhibits similar oxidant preferences as the canonical NpDps we performed a qualitative absorption spectroscopy analysis in which oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> was determined. While Fe<sup>2+</sup> is transparent at the wavelength 310 nm, the formation of Fe<sup>3+</sup> is accompanied with a clear absorbance increase at this wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218300.g005">Fig 5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref034">34</xref>]. All experiments were done under aerobic conditions. During an incubation time of 2 min the absorbance at 310 nm did not increase in the reaction buffer (5 mM succinate buffer at pH 6.0 and 50 mM NaCl) in the presence of 0.5 &#956;M NpDps4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218300.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, red curve). When 24 &#956;M Fe<sup>2+</sup> was added, the absorbance increased logarithmically with a fast initial increase reaching Abs<sub>310nm</sub> 0.014 after 2 min, which represented ~ 26% of the maximum absorbance (max. Abs<sub>310nm</sub> = 0.053) in this reaction. In the following 30 min the reaction slowed down and the Abs<sub>310nm</sub> reached 0.032 and was monitored further to a total of 420 min reaching an absorbance of 0.046 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218300.s005">S1 File</xref>). At a ratio of 48 Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Dps protein all Fe<sup>2+</sup> binding sites inside the Dps dodecamer could be theoretically occupied, as there are 12 FOC with each two iron binding sites per Dps protein (24 Fe<sup>2+</sup>/dodecamer binding sites). In the control experiment, that contained no protein material, 24 &#956;M of Fe<sup>2+</sup> was added to the reaction mixture, but no change in the absorbance was detected for the next 45 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218300.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, black curve), neither for during the following 420 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218300.s005">S1 File</xref>).

The increase in absorbance at 310 nm could be stopped with the establishment of anaerobic conditions (sparging with argon), while subsequent aeration would lead to the absorbance rise to recommence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218300.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>We found that the His78, with some exceptions, can be broadly found among cyanobacterial Dps sequences. In strains within five of the six phylogenetic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref041">41</xref>], namely in Nx (<italic>Nostocales sensu lato</italic> + others), LPP-B (<italic>Leptolyngbya</italic> + <italic>Nodosilinea</italic> + <italic>Synechococcus</italic>), AcTh (<italic>Acaryochloris</italic> + <italic>Thermosynechococcus</italic>), Osc (<italic>Oscillatoriales sensu stricto</italic>) and SPM (<italic>Synechocystis</italic> + <italic>Pleurocapsa</italic> + <italic>Microcystis</italic>) we found Dps protein sequences that possessed the His78. Some of the aligned Dps sequences within the groups of Nx (Cal6303_4560) and SPM (SynPCC7002_A0031, Cyan10605_1025, Slr1894, MAE_62840) did not contain the His78, but instead the conserved Asp at the equivalent position. A further analysis of the genomic data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://genome.microbedb.jp/cyanobase/" ns0:type="simple">http://genome.microbedb.jp/cyanobase/</ext-link>) showed that other putative Dps proteins within the investigated strains exhibited only canonical FOC. All Dps homolog sequences to NpDps4 that clustered within the phylogenetic group of SynPro (<italic>Syncechococcus</italic> + <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> + <italic>Cyanobium</italic>) and <italic>Gloeobacter</italic> species were not found to exhibit the His78, but the conserved Asp or Glu as found in canonical FOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218300.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Also the analysis of the genomic data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://genome.microbedb.jp/cyanobase/" ns0:type="simple">http://genome.microbedb.jp/cyanobase/</ext-link>) showed that all putative Dps within the investigated strains contained canonical FOCs. Only a limited number of sequenced cyanobacterial genomes are available and a selection of representative Dps homologs from different phylogenetic groups was utilized in this study. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the His78 might be found in Dps sequences from other strains within the SynPro group. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the FOC motif containing the His78 is broadly spread across the cyanobacterial phylum including unicellular, filamentous, filamentous heterocystous cyanobacteria from both, marine and freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the His164 that coordinates to the iron at FOC site B in NpDps4 is frequently found among the aligned Dps sequences cyanobacterial Dps that simultaneously possess the His78. This correlation was not seen for the cyanobacterium <italic>Gloeobacter violaceus</italic> PCC 7421 (gll0337) and the DpsA from <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> (HsDpsA), an archaeal Dps. Canonical Dps usually possess a Met or Phe, at the corresponding position of His164. These amino acids are not involved in FOC formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref029">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref042">42</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref044">44</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have gathered structural and biochemical data that supports our previously proposed hypothesis that the NpDps4 is an atypical Dps protein. NpDps4 diverges from canonical Dps especially by its amino acid composition at the FOC. Also, no evidence for NpDps4 using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an oxidant in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> was discovered.</p>

<title>The His-type FOC&#8211;a novel subclass of FOC</title>
<p>By crystal structure analysis, we have found that the FOC in NpDps4 exhibits special features that differentiate it from the group of canonical FOCs in Dps proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref013">13</xref>]. In NpDps4: (i) the His78 replaces a highly conserved Asp at the metal binding site A and is likewise involved in metal coordination, (ii) the amino acid at position 67 is an Asn that does not contribute to metal binding. This is different from the canonical FOC, in which a conserved Glu or Asp at position 67 is involved in coordination of the metal in FOC site B mediated via an intermediate water molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref029">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref031">31</xref>], (iii) His63 coordinates directly to the Fe atom in site B, which is an unusual finding, as canonical Dps proteins also possess a His at that position, but it coordinates via an intermediate water molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref029">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref031">31</xref>], (iv) the His164 from a third monomer is involved in the metal coordination at FOC site B. The contribution from a third monomer is unusual and novel in FOC formation. In canonical Dps non-coordinating Met or Phe are conserved at the His164 position in NpDps4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref029">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref042">42</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref044">44</xref>]. All these structural properties accord with those found in the crystal structure of TeDpsA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref014">14</xref>], the homolog to NpDps4. To sum up, in canonical FOCs metal coordination is clearly dominated by negatively charged carboxylates. Instead NpDps4 and TeDpsA share a pronounced His character, which leads us to propose a novel FOC classification, the His-type FOC, which appears to be broadly found within the cyanobacterial phylum.</p>

<title>The His-type FOC&#8211;a common feature among cyanobacterial Dps sequences</title>
<p>In this study we show that members in five out of six recently categorized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref041">41</xref>] cyanobacterial phylogenetic groups possess Dps proteins that contain the His-type FOC. Even though our data set represents a limited subset of sequenced genomes, we were still able to show how broadly the His-type FOC can be found across the cyanobacterial phylum. Interestingly, features of the His-type FOC have not been identified in any other bacterial phyla implying that the His-type FOC has a specific function in the cyanobacterial metabolism such as photosynthesis. But as mentioned above, not all cyanobacteria appear to possess a Dps protein with the His-type FOC. This is the case for <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803, <italic>Gloeobacter</italic> sp. and the shown cyanobacteria within the phylogenetic group SynPro (<italic>Syncechococcus</italic> + <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> + <italic>Cyanobium</italic>). One may ask why some cyanobacteria possess a Dps protein with this unique FOC and others do not. Both, marine and freshwater cyanobacteria can possess it, and cellular morphology does not appear to be decisive in this regard as members of unicellular (e.g. <italic>Cyanothece</italic> sp., <italic>Gloeobacter</italic> sp.), colony forming (e.g. <italic>Xenococcus</italic> sp.), filamentous (e.g. <italic>Oscillatoria</italic> sp.), heterocystous (e.g. <italic>Calothrix</italic> sp., <italic>Nostoc</italic> sp.) and branching filamentous (e.g. <italic>Hapalosiphon</italic> sp., not shown in this study) cyanobacteria exhibit Dps containing the His-type FOC. Also, the organism&#8217;s complexity in terms of cellular differentiation does not seem be a factor for the possession of this special Dps protein. This can be exemplified by <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>elongatus</italic>, both of which possess the His-type FOC. <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic> is capable of forming vegetative cells, heterocysts, dormant cells that are called akinetes as well as motile hormogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref019">19</xref>], while for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>elongatus</italic> the genetic prerequisites for cellular differentiation have not been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref045">45</xref>]. This implies that the Dps protein containing the His-type FOC might have a general role among those cyanobacteria that possess it. This hypothesis is also reinforced by the different ecological context in which <italic>T</italic>. <italic>elongatus</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic> live. While <italic>T</italic>. <italic>elongatus</italic> is a thermophile in hot springs with optimal growth temperatures at 55 &#176;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref005">5</xref>], <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic> was isolated from coralloid roots of an Australian cycad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref019">19</xref>]. To reveal what specific function the His-type FOC has in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic>, we have collected data to characterize and also to compare it to the canonical Dps that were earlier characterized in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic>. Our working hypothesis is that the five NpDps complement each other in their roles to comply with the interdependent processes iron homeostasis and ROS protection.</p>

<title>Iron binding in NpDps4 and its physiological role</title>
<p>By crystal structure analysis we identified two Fe atoms that bind to the FOC in NpDps4. This is in agreement with the general hypothesis that Dps proteins exhibit FOCs that coordinate two Fe atoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref046">46</xref>]. However, only a few Dps crystal structures have shown two Fe atoms bound to the FOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref029">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref031">31</xref>]. More often, Dps crystal structures have been reported to be occupied only at site A by an iron atom. It was argued that the weaker coordination affinity at site B would lead to an empty FOC site B or a coordination to a water molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref048">48</xref>]. In our spectroscopic analysis we observed that NpDps4 catalyzed Fe<sup>2+</sup> by O<sub>2</sub>, but the presence of NpDps4 did not alter the oxidation rate of Fe<sup>2+</sup> reacting with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This is different from the earlier studied canonical Dps from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic> (NpDps1-3) in which Fe<sup>2+</sup> is oxidized by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and not by O<sub>2</sub> (Howe et al 2018). The NpDps 1&#8211;3 dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation was shown with the same spectroscopic experimental strategy as the one used for NpDps4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref049">49</xref>]. Typically Dps proteins reduce both O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, with an up to 100-fold higher affinity towards H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref004">4</xref>]. Our results do not exclude that NpDps4 might be able to use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under other conditions then the once investigated, but still imply that NpDps4 might not be involved in regulating the intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level, but rather act as an O<sub>2</sub> scavenger. NpDps4 would therefore be able to regulate the O<sub>2</sub> concentration, and the intracellular Fe<sup>2+</sup> pool. For a heterocystous cyanobacterium like <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic>, the regulation of both Fe<sup>2+</sup> and the O<sub>2</sub> might be vital under certain circumstances, especially in conditions that promote oxidative stress. We have earlier discovered that NpDps4 is more abundant in heterocysts than in vegetative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref018">18</xref>], and now suggest that its ability to reduce O<sub>2</sub> via Fe<sup>2+</sup> might be crucial in heterocysts. Heterocysts are known to sustain a microoxic environment which is needed for the activity of the O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref019">19</xref>]. There are well characterized intracellular mechanisms that reduce the O<sub>2</sub> concentration in heterocysts such as the increased respiration rate, a non-O<sub>2</sub> producing photosystem II and multiple cell walls impeding O<sub>2</sub> diffusion from the outside [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref019">19</xref>]. However, it may be that NpDps4 acts as an additional valve to regulate the O<sub>2</sub> concentration if a sufficient Fe<sup>2+</sup> pool is available. Similar to NpDps4, the BaDps1 from the facultative aerobic <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> was identified to only utilize O<sub>2</sub> for Fe<sup>2+</sup> oxidation. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>anthracis</italic> possesses another Dps, the BaDps2, which could effectively utilize both the oxidants O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref044">44</xref>]. The authors argued that the functional separation for the Dps may enable a better environmental adaption to a variety of O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. We have earlier studied the oxidant preferences of NpDps1-3 and found that all three utilize H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but not solely O<sub>2</sub> for Fe<sup>2+</sup> oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref020">20</xref>]. Based on sequence comparisons, these three NpDps comprise a canonical FOC and it might be that amino acid exchanges in the coordination sphere of the FOC, e.g. His vs Asp, could lead to different oxidant preferences towards H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> as suggested for the DpsA from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>elongatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref014">14</xref>]. This potential structure-function relationship could serve as a basis for future studies. For the studied NpDps it is clear that both the FOC coordination spheres and the respective physiological roles of NpDps1-3 clearly distinguishes them from NpDps4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref021">21</xref>]. The physiological significance of the differential oxidant preferences among the NpDps remains to be explored, but some structural features such as the pore structures might influence the oxidant preference. These pores guide Fe<sup>2+</sup>, but also its potent oxidants H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> into the internal protein cavity.</p>

<title>The atypical ferritin-like and Dps-type pores in NpDps4</title>
<p>Dps proteins usually exhibit four ferritin-like and four Dps-type pores connecting the exterior with the inner protein cavity. The pores will be discussed individually starting with the ferritin-like pore. In the ferritin-like pore from NpDps4 two positively charged Arg are flanked by Glu (cavity, Glu152, Arg148, Arg145, Glu140 towards exterior). These two Arg could potentially electrostatically shield the pore from metal entrance. In canonical Dps the existence of positively charged amino acids across the channel has rarely been reported. Instead, several conserved negatively charged Asp and to a lesser extent from Glu have been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref050">50</xref>]. In <italic>L</italic>. <italic>innocua</italic> Dps (LiDps) it has been shown that negatively charged amino acids are important for Fe<sup>2+</sup> translocation into the protein cavity as they attract the ions by charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref051">51</xref>]. Although poorly studied, there are other Dps proteins with a similar pore interior as identified for NpDps4. The Dps2 from <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (MsDps2) exhibits a similar amino acid channel composition. In MsDps2 a pair of His is flanked by two Asp (cavity, Asp138, His141, His126, Asp127, towards exterior). The authors suggested that the His, which are not conserved among Dps, could influence the conformations of the Asp thereby favoring iron uptake or its release out of the Dps. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref052">52</xref>]. Also for the HsDpsA a similar amino acid arrangement (cavity, Glu154, Arg153, His150, Glu141, towards exterior) was found, although in a closed state, in which the translocation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> was unlikely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref031">31</xref>]. However, structural information on Dps pores originates from static crystal structure analysis. It is therefore unclear whether molecular dynamics in the protein structure underline the pore opening and closing mechanisms.</p>
<p>The Dps-type pore of NpDps4 is lined with polar hydroxyl groups and negatively charged carboxylates from Ser61, Glu58 and Thr175. Also this finding deviates from the common picture of typical Dps proteins, since Dps-type pores are usually of hydrophobic character and the participating amino acids are not conserved. Typically, the Dps-type pore of canonical Dps has not been associated with metal ion translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref005">5</xref>]. However, in atypical Dps such as the HsDpsA, similarities in the amino acid composition of the NpDps4 Dps-type pore can be found. HsDpsA has an even more negatively charged character (cavity, Glu56, Glu171, Asp172, towards exterior) as compared to NpDps4. In HsDpsA, Fe atoms were identified by crystal structure analysis to be bound within the Dps-type pore, indicating the Dps-type pore has a role in iron translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref031">31</xref>]. Notably, the exterior of the Dps-type pores in NpDps4 is capped by three C-terminal residues, but leaving an opening to the water-loaded pore. Dps-type pore has been reported to be flexible in their aperture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref005">5</xref>], but many have also been found in a closed state. Similar to the cap-like structure in NpDps4, C-terminal extensions were found in the <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> Dps1 (DrDps1), although blocking the entry of the pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref053">53</xref>]. But more often the blockade is caused by bulky side chains within the channel impeding a possible metal ion translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref054">54</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref056">56</xref>]. The interface at the Dps-like pore has additionally been identified to be a crucial structural element that evolutionarily links maxiferritins with Dps proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref057">57</xref>]. It was shown that a single mutation at this interface could render the dodecameric structure of a Dps protein into a maxiferritin during protein crystallization.</p>
<p>Static analyses via crystal structural determination is accompanied with clear limitations on answering crucial question about dynamic processes in Dps proteins. In the future other techniques are required to verify previously suggested conformation-regulated opening and closing mechanisms of the two pore types. Furthermore, the structural variety among Dps-type and ferritin-like pores indicates the need for further structural classification. The pore structures in Dps proteins have been assigned as the gate keepers for metal ion translocation. But not only iron has been identified to travel into the protein cavity. Zn<sup>2+</sup> has often been found to bind to the FOCs.</p>

<title>Zinc inhibits NpDps4 oxidizing Fe<sup>2+</sup> at the His-type FOC</title>
<p>One Zn atom was coordinated to the FOC site A in the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-soaked crystals of NpDps4. The observation of Zn-binding at the FOC was not surprising, as other Dps proteins were also found to coordinate one Zn atom at site A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref035">35</xref>] or two Zn atoms occupying both site A and site B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref058">58</xref>] at the FOC. The FOC in Dps structures contains His, Asp and Glu, which are typical amino acids for Zn-binding sites in other enzymes that utilize zinc ions as a cofactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref060">60</xref>]. But is zinc really a cofactor in Dps proteins as suggested for the TeDpsA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref014">14</xref>]? In our spectroscopic experiments we observed that Zn<sup>2+</sup> efficiently inhibited NpDps4 catalyzing the O<sub>2</sub> mediated Fe<sup>2+</sup> oxidation. This effect has also been seen for other Dps e.g. DrDps1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref037">37</xref>], <italic>Listeria innocua</italic> Dps (LiDps) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref036">36</xref>] and <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> Dps (SsDps) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref035">35</xref>]. By contrast, the Zn-bound TeDpsA was observed to have nearly equal oxidant preferences towards H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> for Fe<sup>2+</sup> oxidation catalysis. Notably, Dps usually oxidize Fe<sup>2+</sup> ~ 100 times faster with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as compared to with O<sub>2</sub> and have been associated to protect the organism against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref004">4</xref>].

However, they could not obtain Zn-free TeDpsA protein material to characterize its activity serving as a control. The structural similarity between the FOC of TeDpsA and NpDps4 suggests similar functions, but the different biochemical role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> remains unclear.</p>
<p>Besides Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Dps proteins appear to notoriously bind (at the FOC or at other binding sites) to a large variety of metal ions such as Cd<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref043">43</xref>], Co<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref053">53</xref>], Mn<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref061">61</xref>], Ni<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref050">50</xref>] and Cu<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref050">50</xref>]. Therefore it has been hypothesized that they may act as intracellular metal ion sponges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref030">30</xref>]. High concentrations of these metals could lead to stress conditions causing damages to the organism as shown for <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref062">62</xref>]. In this regard, ferritins have been suggested to act as zinc detoxification agents delivering a certain stress resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref063">63</xref>]. For <italic>S</italic>. <italic>suis</italic> it has been hypothesized that its Dps may also deliver a protective mechanism against zinc at toxic concentrations, even if that would mean the inhibition of its FOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref035">35</xref>]. In <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic> Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations above 18 &#956;M have been shown to be cytotoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref062">62</xref>].

It remains unknown whether Dps proteins have a native function in regulating other metals than Fe<sup>2+</sup>, but it might be that their metal-binding properties is simply an encompassed effect of their innate design to attract and sequester iron.</p>
<p>We have collected data that resolves different biochemical aspects of the non-canonical NpDps4 suggesting it to be an O<sub>2</sub>-scavenger in heterocysts of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>punctiforme</italic>. Through crystal structure analysis and sequence alignment, we have classified a new type of FOC, the His-type FOC. It comprises a unique composition, within Dps structures, that can be broadly found across the cyanobacterial phylum. Whether the His-type FOC is a feature that is confined to cyanobacterial Dps and connected to the oxygenic photosynthesis of cyanobacteria needs to be further investigated.</p>

<title>Crystallization and data collection</title>
<p>Initial crystallization trials were performed by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method in a 96-well MRC-crystallization plate (Molecular Dimensions) using a Mosquito (TTP Labtech) pipetting robot. Droplets of 0.1 &#956;L protein solution at 10 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> were mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution using screens from Molecular Dimensions (PACT, PGA, Structure Screen I/II and MIDAS) at room temperature. Crystals appeared in several conditions. The final crystallization condition was optimized to 25% SOKALAN HP 66, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0 and 0.2 M NaOAc. Rod shaped crystals grew in a few days. The crystals were soaked for a few seconds in mother liquor solution supplemented with 20%-glycerol before they were flash cooled in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored until data collection. For obtaining metal complexes the crystals were transferred to a cryo solution containing 15%-glycerol and 10 mM of the metal ion solution (FeSO<sub>4</sub> and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> respectively). In this solution the chelating SOKALAN HP 66 was exchanged for 25%-PEG4000. Diffraction data of the metal-free and metal-treated proteins were collected at beamlines ID29 and ID23-1 respectively at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France using Pilatus 6M-F detectors.

<title>Spectroscopic analyses of NpDps4</title>
<p>Spectroscopic experiments of Fe<sup>2+</sup> oxidation by O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were performed on a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Varian). Samples were measured in 1 cm standard quartz cuvettes. All experiments were done at room temperature. The time-dependent absorbance was recorded at 310 nm, which corresponds to Fe<sup>3+</sup> formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0218300.ref034">34</xref>]. During all experiments, reaction solutions were maintained aerobic. The reaction buffer contained in all reactions 5 mM succinate and 50 mM NaCl, at pH 6.0. Where indicated, 0.5 &#956;M (dodecamer concentration) of purified NpDps4 protein was added. As the protein addition caused a slight background absorbance increase, the absorbance was set to zero and no further change during prolonged protein incubation was detected.</p>
<p>When the reactivity between Fe<sup>2+</sup> and O<sub>2</sub> (reaction mixture was exposed to air) were investigated, freshly prepared and N<sub>2</sub>-sparged 24 &#956;M FeSO<sub>4</sub> was added to the solution and the absorbance at 310 nm was monitored between 10 min and 8 hours depending on the experimental scheme. To investigate the reactivity of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 16 &#956;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was incubated with NpDps4 between 2&#8211;10 min. Subsequently 24 &#956;M Fe<sup>2+</sup> was added and the oxidation was followed as absorbance at 310 nm.</p>
<p>To study the effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on the oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> by O<sub>2</sub> (reaction mixture was exposed to air) 12 &#956;M ZnSO<sub>4</sub> was added to the reaction mixture in two separate experiments. In the 1<sup>st</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> was incubated with the protein material for 8 min and then Fe<sup>2+</sup> was added to the reaction mixture. In a 2<sup>nd</sup> experiment Fe<sup>2+</sup> was first added to the protein and after 5 min Zn<sup>2+</sup> was added. The absorbance was followed at 310 nm.</p>
<p>After the addition of any chemical the reaction volume was quickly mixed by multiple resuspending. Controls of identical experiments without the addition of protein were performed. Absorption spectra (200&#8211;800 nm) were frequently recorded to check whether protein solubility was affected. The absorbance data presented in this study were reconstructed in their time-axis as absorbance spectra were recorded in between subsequent absorbance traces over time.

<p>Reviewer #1: The current manuscript focused on the structural and kinetic studies of Dps4 from a cyanobacteria. Interestingly Nostoc punctiforme, the phototrophic and filamentous cyanobacterium encodes for five different Dps, but the specific function of each Dps it is not fully yet stablished. Thus, the work present in the current manuscript, contribute to elucidate the function of the NpDps4. Nevertheless, there are a several modifications that have to be included in the manuscript, mainly regarding the kinetic analysis of the data, which was not properly performed; and a more detailed crystal structure analysis.</p>
<p>The authors should be more carefully with the scientific language, please rephrase the following sentences.</p>
<p>Page 6, line 147 - &#8220;meet thus creating a pore.&#8221; - The pore is not created, it is formed, and word &#8220;meet&#8221; should be avoided. Please rephrase.</p>
<p>Page 7, line 158 - &#8220;of three monomers meet&#8221;. Again the word &#8220;meet&#8221; should be avoided.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>Page 5-9, line 123-204 &#8211;Although the overall fold is the same in the three structures presented (5HJF, 5HJH, 5I4J), the authors should present the rmsd between the different structures.</p>
<p>Besides the difference in the ferroxidase center that the authors comment, is there any structural difference in the crystal structures induced by the presence of the different metals, for instance in the 3-fold pores, or in other part of the structure.</p>
<p>Page 6 and 7, line 147-153- The authors described the ferritin-like pore of the NpDps4, but they do not mentioned if there is any water or metal located in this pore.</p>
<p>Page 7, line 158-164 &#8211; The authors describe the Dps-like pore in the NpDps4, and they mention that it contains a &#8220;small cap-like structure on the outside of the protein&#8221;. However it is not clear if the pore is blocked by any residue from the C-terminal tails that are at the top of the pore, and if the nature of these residues is negative or positive. A more detailed description should be included.</p>
<p>Page 8, line 188, 195- The authors mentioned that the distance between Fe in site A and Fe in site B is 3.5 &#197;, and that there is one water molecule coordinating both irons. Is this a bridging molecule, if so it is not clear how can be at a distance of 2.2 and 2.3 &#197; from site A and B respectively, since the distance between the two irons is 3.5 &#197;. This part should be clarified.</p>
<p>Page 7-9, lines 173-205 &#8211; In order to understand if the Fe in site B is more loosely coordinated, and if the distances between the metals and the coordinating residues are similar in the structure with Fe or Zn, a Table with the coordination distances between the different coordinating residues and the metal ions for the different structures should be included. The authors should compare the distances between the coordinating residues and Fe in site A, and those for Fe in site B.</p>
<p>Page 8, lines 198-204; Page 10, lines 252-269 &#8211; The authors have determined the crystal structure of NpDps4 in which the crystals were independently soaked with a solution of FeSO4 or ZnSO4. The structures showed that the iron was bound in two position, site A and B, while in the case of the structure with zinc, the metal was bound to a similar structural position as the Fe in site A. Moreover, by kinetic studies the authors showed that the zinc inhibits the iron oxidation rates. In order to understand if the &#8220;di-iron&#8221; center formed upon iron addition is not maintained in the presence of zinc, or if it is form a mixed di-center with Zn and Fe, it would be interesting to determine the crystal structure, in which the crystals were first soaked with an iron solution followed by a zinc solution.</p>
<p>Page 10, 226-240 &#8211; Iron oxidation assays. The authors mentioned the increase of absorbance at 310 nm which is related with the oxidation of iron by the protein. Nevertheless, the authors should present a proper analysis of the data, the initial rate should be determined for each assay, with the corresponding error bar.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors only present one condition tested, in which they have used 0.5 uM with 24uM Fe, corresponding to a ratio of 48 Fe/dodecamer and 4Fe/monomer. A proper kinetic study should be included, using different Fe/dodecamer from 12 to the maximum capacity per dodecamer. In addition, for each assay the iron oxidation rates have to be determined, which is not presented in the current version of the manuscript. As an example &#8220;Abs310nm 0.014 after 2 min&#8221; (page 10, line 230) is not a rate.</p>
<p>Page 10, lines 241-251 &#8211; The authors also address the iron oxidation by using hydrogen peroxide. Although they do not see any difference with and without the protein, in order to account only for the contribution of hydrogen peroxide, have the authors performed the assays for iron oxidation by hydrogen peroxide under anaerobic conditions. As mentioned before, the data should be presented with the error bars, and they have to present iron oxidation rates.</p>
<p>Page 11, lines 258-260; Fig 6A- From Fig 6A and from the corresponding legend it is clear that the protein is able to oxidize the iron (black line) but if zinc was added before, the iron oxidation is inhibited. Nevertheless, the corresponding phrase, in the text (page 11, lines 258-260) is not clear, please rephrase it.</p>
<p>Page 15-17, lines 368-415- The authors present an analysis of different amino acid sequences of Dps, and they proposed a His-type FOC. The others NpDps instead of His63 present an aspartate residues, moreover as it states in the Introduction part (page 4, lines 91-92) the NpDps1-3 catalyzes the iron oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and not with oxygen, while NpDps4 is the other way around. So, it would be interesting if the authors could comment on the oxidation rates for the other NpDps or even for &#8220;canonical&#8221; Dps that contain a aspartate residue and their specificity of hydrogen peroxide vs oxygen and histidine vs aspartate.</p>
<p>Page 19, line 481 &#8211; Please define DrDps1, since it is the first time it is mentioned in the text.</p>
<p>Page 20, lines 514-515 &#8211; The authors have wrote that &#8220;ferritins have be found to act as zinc detoxification agents delivering a certain stress resistance&#8221;- do the authors have any evidence that the NpDps4 stores Zn or was only tested for the inhibition of the iron oxidation.</p>
<p>Figure 2 &#8211; The different subunits should be in different colours, similar to the one presented in Figure 4. In addition, the corresponding residues should use the same colour as the subunit, maintaining the red for the oxygen and blue for nitrogen.</p>
<p>Figure 3 &#8211; For clarity, figure 3A should be zoom-in and the residues should be in the same colour as the corresponding subunit, maintaining the red for the oxygen and blue for nitrogen.</p>
<p>Figure 7 &#8211; From the figure it was not clear the representation of &#8220;lengths of &#945;-helices refer to the crystal structure of NpDps4 and are indicated by black bars and red letters.&#8221; In the figure legend the explanation for the different His-type FOC should be induced, namely the definition of Nx, SynPro, LPP-B, AcTh, Osc, SPM.</p>
<p>Figure 7 &#8211; Since N. punctiforme contains five different Dps, is there any reason why NpDps5 was not included in the Multiple sequence alignment presented in Fig. 7. Moreover, for clarity for the reader, the figure should include the name of the organism instead of the protein code. The figure legend should have the information for each protein code and the corresponding name of the organism, as it is currently.</p>
<p>Table 1 &#8211; The authors should comment on why they did not process the data of Metal-free NpDps4 structure to a higher resolution based on their values of I/&#963;(I).</p>
<p>To be consistent the authors should present the values for highest resolution shell for the Rwork and Rfree.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The authors Howe et al., in their work about the fourth Dps from Nostoc punctiforme has tried to unravel its role in the organism and propose a new class of Dps, having His-type Ferroxidation centres unique to cyanobacteria. They also claim the NpDps4 uses O2 over H2O2 to oxidise iron. Also, crystal structures of apo, iron bound and zinc bound Dps has been analysed and they conclude by spectroscopic assays that binding of Zinc to the FOC inhibits ferroxidation.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s interesting to note the presence of a new type of ferroxidation site in cyanobacterial Dps, the authors could not make convincing theories about its possible biological significance. There are also some major points that the authors need to address regarding their other findings to make their claims credible.</p>
<p>The following points are raised in the order they occur in the text:</p>
<p>Line 142</p>
<p>The residues Phe95, Leu98 and Ala99 are mentioned in the text but not marked in the figure.</p>
<p>Line 157</p>
<p>&#8230; acid of the trio &#8230;</p>
<p>Lines 168-169</p>
<p>&#8220;each symmetrical amino acid of the trio is indicated only once&#8221;, but Figure 3B shows amino acids from all three monomers related by three-fold.</p>
<p>Line 174</p>
<p>How does the authors know SOKALAN66 is a metal chelating agent?</p>
<p>Line 176</p>
<p>Is there any experimental evidence whether it is really Zinc or Iron bound in the crystal structure like anomalous X-ray scattering or even a simple detection of Zinc ions on a gel?</p>
<p>Line 177</p>
<p>It would be more desirable to show electron density maps to show the fitting of ion atoms in Figure 4</p>
<p>Line 189</p>
<p>Since the FOC is formed not only of residues from two monomers related by two-fold, but also from a third monomer it is also unusual for Dps proteins.</p>
<p>Lines 213-214</p>
<p>The sentence can be phrased better</p>
<p>Line 220</p>
<p>What is the rationale of using 24 mM Fe2+ and 0.5 mM NpDps?</p>
<p>Lines 241-250</p>
<p>If the ferroxidation experiments using H2O2 were done under aerobic conditions, how does the authors discount for the effect of O2 on oxidation and especially as they&#8217;re comparing the ferroxidation properties between O2 and H2O2. It is strange that the graph doesn&#8217;t show any increase in ferroxidation under aerobic conditions, as in the above paragraph they show that oxygen can be used for ferroxidation by NpDps4.</p>
<p>Lines 262-263</p>
<p>Does the inhibition of ferroxidation by Zinc related to it causing protein aggregation as it is mentioned in line 263 that Zinc negatively impacts protein solubility?</p>
<p>Lines 282-288</p>
<p>Addition of Zinc indicated by arrow is misleading in Figure 6B as the black graph shows the reaction without Zn addition. In line 287 the authors mean figure 6B and not 6A?</p>
<p>Line 302</p>
<p>Figure 7 is illegible, and nothing can be inferred from it. So, the authors most important claim that the his-type FOC is conserved across cyanobacteria cannot be ascertained at all from the figure.</p>
<p>Line 392</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear to the reader what is &#8216;the specific function&#8217; in cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>Line 470</p>
<p>Recent developments on the dps-like interface and its role as an evolutionary switch between dps and ferritins has to be mentioned when discussing the role of this interface.</p>
<p>Lines 620-621</p>
<p>During the ferroxidation experiment the authors talk of mixing the reaction by resuspension. How do they account for the reaction time that has elapsed during this process? Wherever possible cuvettes with stirrers should be used as these reaction rates can be pretty fast, especially the rates with H2O2.</p>
<p>Line 626</p>
<p>Ideally kinetic data should be evaluated from 3-4 experiments and at least two different protein preparations.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, Dr Pereira,</p>
<p>Enclosed, please find a revised version of our manuscript entitled &#8220;The Dps4 from Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 is a member of His-type FOC containing Dps class that can be broadly found among cyanobacteria&#8221;</p>
<p>By: Christoph Howe, Vamsi K. Moparthi, Felix M. Ho, Karina Persson and myself, which I hope now is acceptable for publication in PLOS ONE.</p>
<p>In this revised version we addressed all points raised by the Reviewers and Editor. As a result, the manuscript underwent significant changes and additions in both text and figures. We have tried our best to answer all the comments and to improve our manuscript accordingly. In particular, we modified some of the main figures and added requested information concerning a more detailed crystal structure analysis in Supplementary material. We also added missing experimental information and data to clarify details concerning our spectroscopic analysis. We believe that the revised data and results part are more clear and fully support the discussion and conclusions in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Our point to point response to the comments from both Reviewers can be found on the following pages. We appreciate very much time and effort that Reviewer(s) have spent and put in reading and commenting on our manuscript. We thank the reviewer(s) for their valuable suggestions which has improved the manuscript.</p>
<p>We have uploaded an annotated manuscript (word file) including track-changed text to allow for our changes to be easily found.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p>Karin Stensj&#246; (<email ns0:type="simple">karin.stensjo@kemi.uu.se</email>), on behalf of all authors</p>

<p>Answers to Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: The current manuscript focused on the structural and kinetic studies of Dps4 from a cyanobacteria. Interestingly Nostoc punctiforme, the phototrophic and filamentous cyanobacterium encodes for five different Dps, but the specific function of each Dps it is not fully yet stablished. Thus, the work present in the current manuscript, contribute to elucidate the function of the NpDps4. Nevertheless, there are a several modifications that have to be included in the manuscript, mainly regarding the kinetic analysis of the data, which was not properly performed; and a more detailed crystal structure analysis.</p>
<p>The authors should be more carefully with the scientific language, please rephrase the following sentences.</p>
<p>Page 6, line 147 - &#8220;meet thus creating a pore.&#8221; - The pore is not created, it is formed, and word &#8220;meet&#8221; should be avoided. Please rephrase.</p>
<p>-We have rephrased the sentence.</p>
<p>Page 7, line 158 - &#8220;of three monomers meet&#8221;. Again the word &#8220;meet&#8221; should be avoided.</p>
<p>-We have rephrased the sentence.</p>
<p>Page 5-9, line 123-204 &#8211;Although the overall fold is the same in the three structures presented (5HJF, 5HJH, 5I4J), the authors should present the rmsd between the different structures.</p>
<p>Besides the difference in the ferroxidase center that the authors comment, is there any structural difference in the crystal structures induced by the presence of the different metals, for instance in the 3-fold pores, or in other part of the structure.</p>
<p>-The rmsd are now included in the manuscript. We additionally contemplate on the differences of the three crystal structures in more detail.</p>
<p>Page 6 and 7, line 147-153- The authors described the ferritin-like pore of the NpDps4, but they do not mentioned if there is any water or metal located in this pore.</p>
<p>-In the metal-free and iron-bound enzyme there is a water molecule (low occupancy) located in the pore, equally distanced from Glu140 and Arg148. In the Zn-structure there are no ordered waters or ions in connection to the pore. </p>
<p>Page 7, line 158-164 &#8211; The authors describe the Dps-like pore in the NpDps4, and they mention that it contains a &#8220;small cap-like structure on the outside of the protein&#8221;. However it is not clear if the pore is blocked by any residue from the C-terminal tails that are at the top of the pore, and if the nature of these residues is negative or positive. A more detailed description should be included.</p>
<p>-The pore is not blocked by the C-terminal residues. The sequence of the five final residues in the models is FVQAA. The five final residues that form the cap leave an opening to the pore, e.g. the pore is not blocked. Corresponding changes have been made in the text.</p>
<p>Page 8, line 188, 195- The authors mentioned that the distance between Fe in site A and Fe in site B is 3.5 &#197;, and that there is one water molecule coordinating both irons. Is this a bridging molecule, if so it is not clear how can be at a distance of 2.2 and 2.3 &#197; from site A and B respectively, since the distance between the two irons is 3.5 &#197;. This part should be clarified.</p>
<p>-The water molecule is not located on a straight line between the Fe-ions. The angle between the two Fe-ions and the bridging water molecule is 42&#176; and 53&#176;, respectively. And the the Fe &#8211; water &#8211; Fe angle is 95&#176; This information was added to the manuscript.</p>
<p>Page 7-9, lines 173-205 &#8211; In order to understand if the Fe in site B is more loosely coordinated, and if the distances between the metals and the coordinating residues are similar in the structure with Fe or Zn, a Table with the coordination distances between the different coordinating residues and the metal ions for the different structures should be included. The authors should compare the distances between the coordinating residues and Fe in site A, and those for Fe in site B.</p>
<p>-In general the coordination distances are shorter in the A-site compared to the B-site. There are also differences in the different FOCs, especially regarding Glu82 which binds tightly to the metal in some FOCs whereas it has poorer density in some FOCs which also indicate a possible bidentate coordination. All the coordination distances are now presented in S1 Table.</p>
<p>Page 8, lines 198-204; Page 10, lines 252-269 &#8211; The authors have determined the crystal structure of NpDps4 in which the crystals were independently soaked with a solution of FeSO4 or ZnSO4. The structures showed that the iron was bound in two position, site A and B, while in the case of the structure with zinc, the metal was bound to a similar structural position as the Fe in site A. Moreover, by kinetic studies the authors showed that the zinc inhibits the iron oxidation rates. In order to understand if the &#8220;di-iron&#8221; center formed upon iron addition is not maintained in the presence of zinc, or if it is form a mixed di-center with Zn and Fe, it would be interesting to determine the crystal structure, in which the crystals were first soaked with an iron solution followed by a zinc solution.</p>
<p>-We agree with the referee that this would be an interesting study, and the results we present here regarding Zn inhibition does open up for such investigations. However, due to the likely degradation in crystal quality associated with changes to the soaking solutions, this should be carried out as a focused, separate crystallographic study. This is outside the scope of the present investigation.</p>
<p>Page 10, 226-240 &#8211; Iron oxidation assays. The authors mentioned the increase of absorbance at 310 nm which is related with the oxidation of iron by the protein. Nevertheless, the authors should present a proper analysis of the data, the initial rate should be determined for each assay, with the corresponding error bar. Moreover, the authors only present one condition tested, in which they have used 0.5 uM with 24uM Fe, corresponding to a ratio of 48 Fe/dodecamer and 4Fe/monomer. A proper kinetic study should be included, using different Fe/dodecamer from 12 to the maximum capacity per dodecamer. In addition, for each assay the iron oxidation rates have to be determined, which is not presented in the current version of the manuscript. As an example &#8220;Abs310nm 0.014 after 2 min&#8221; (page 10, line 230) is not a rate.</p>
<p>-The main purpose of the kinetics data here was to compare the Fe-oxidation behaviour of NpDps4 under different conditions. Precise quantitative kinetic analyses with iron oxidation rates were not the objective for this study. We believe that our data show the clear qualitative differences between the different samples and thus support our discussion and conclusions. We have thoroughly read through our text to ensure that we don&#180;t claim to have determined any specific kinetic and inhibition parameters, which was outside the scope of our study. </p>
<p>All data presented originate from the same protein material as was used for the crystallographic work. Two replicate experiments were performed for each analyses. All data from this experiments are now presented in S1 File.</p>
<p>Page 10, lines 241-251 &#8211; The authors also address the iron oxidation by using hydrogen peroxide. Although they do not see any difference with and without the protein, in order to account only for the contribution of hydrogen peroxide, have the authors performed the assays for iron oxidation by hydrogen peroxide under anaerobic conditions. As mentioned before, the data should be presented with the error bars, and they have to present iron oxidation rates.</p>
<p>-All our experiments have been conducted under aerobic conditions. Except for the results presented in supplementary material S3 Fig none of the experiments were performed under anaerobic condition. In regards to the Figure 5B showing the oxidation kinetics of the Fe2+ oxidation reaction with H2O2 under aerobic conditions in the presence of NpDps4, we cannot conclude that the observations are only from H2O2. It is likely that O2-mediated Fe2+ oxidation occurs in the presence of NpDps4, however this was not visible in the experiment. By using the same experimental strategy we previously observed a clear difference in the reaction between Fe2+ and H2O2 in the presence of NpDps1, NpDps2 and NpDps3 as compared to without protein (Howe et al. 2018). Thus the Fe2+ oxidation in NpDps4 is clarly different as compared to canonical Dps proteins.</p>
<p>Howe, C., Ho, F.M., Nenninger, A., Raleiras, P., Stensj&#246;, K. (2018) Differential biochemical properties of three canonical Dps proteins from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme suggest distinct cellular functions. J. Biol. Chem. 293(43) 16635&#8211;16646.</p>
<p>Page 11, lines 258-260; Fig 6A- From Fig 6A and from the corresponding legend it is clear that the protein is able to oxidize the iron (black line) but if zinc was added before, the iron oxidation is inhibited. Nevertheless, the corresponding phrase, in the text (page 11, lines 258-260) is not clear, please rephrase it.</p>
<p>-We agree with reviewerthat the phrase is misleading and have now rewritten the whole paragraph for better clarity.</p>
<p>Page 15-17, lines 368-415- The authors present an analysis of different amino acid sequences of Dps, and they proposed a His-type FOC. The others NpDps instead of His63 present an aspartate residues, moreover as it states in the Introduction part (page 4, lines 91-92) the NpDps1-3 catalyzes the iron oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and not with oxygen, while NpDps4 is the other way around. So, it would be interesting if the authors could comment on the oxidation rates for the other NpDps or even for &#8220;canonical&#8221; Dps that contain a aspartate residue and their specificity of hydrogen peroxide vs oxygen and histidine vs aspartate.</p>
<p>-We agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting topic and have now included a short discussion about the putative importance of the exchange of amino acids. </p>
<p>Page 19, line 481 &#8211; Please define DrDps1, since it is the first time it is mentioned in the text.</p>
<p>-We added the definition of DrDps 1 in the text.</p>
<p>Page 20, lines 514-515 &#8211; The authors have wrote that &#8220;ferritins have be found to act as zinc detoxification agents delivering a certain stress resistance&#8221;- do the authors have any evidence that the NpDps4 stores Zn or was only tested for the inhibition of the iron oxidation.</p>
<p>-We do not have any evidence that NpDps4 stores Zn2+. We have now changed the wording &#8220;have been found&#8221; to &#8220;have been suggested&#8221; as the referred literature did not include strong evidence for ferritins to be a zinc detoxification agent. </p>
<p>Figure 2 &#8211; The different subunits should be in different colours, similar to the one presented in Figure 4. In addition, the corresponding residues should use the same colour as the subunit, maintaining the red for the oxygen and blue for nitrogen.</p>
<p>-Yes we agree and have made new figures accordingly. </p>
<p>Figure 3 &#8211; For clarity, figure 3A should be zoom-in and the residues should be in the same colour as the corresponding subunit, maintaining the red for the oxygen and blue for nitrogen.</p>
<p>-Yes we agree and the figure has been revised.</p>
<p>Figure 7 &#8211; From the figure it was not clear the representation of &#8220;lengths of &#945;-helices refer to the crystal structure of NpDps4 and are indicated by black bars and red letters.&#8221; In the figure legend the explanation for the different His-type FOC should be induced, namely the definition of Nx, SynPro, LPP-B, AcTh, Osc, SPM.</p>
<p>-We implemented the missing black bar and red letter A,B,BC,C and D in Figure 7 that represent the &#945; -helices of NpDps4 and the helix annotation, respectively. For clarity, the sentence was also revised. The abbreviations for the different cyanobacterial classes have been added to the figure legend.</p>
<p>Figure 7 &#8211; Since N. punctiforme contains five different Dps, is there any reason why NpDps5 was not included in the Multiple sequence alignment presented in Fig. 7. Moreover, for clarity for the reader, the figure should include the name of the organism instead of the protein code. The figure legend should have the information for each protein code and the corresponding name of the organism, as it is currently.</p>
<p>-NpDps5 was not included into the sequence alignment as it was previously identified to comprise a Bfr-like sequence [Ekman et al. 2014]. We have identified similarities with the Dps-like structures from the archaea Pyrochoccocus furiosus [Ramsay et al. 2006] and Sulfolobus Solfataricus [Gauss  et al. 2006]. NpDps5 requires a separate analysis. We have now included this explanation in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Table 1 &#8211; The authors should comment on why they did not process the data of Metal-free NpDps4 structure to a higher resolution based on their values of I/&#963;(I).</p>
<p>To be consistent the authors should present the values for highest resolution shell for the Rwork and Rfree.</p>
<p>-We present the original data from the ESRF synchrotron at high atomic resolution that fulfilled the aim of our study. The values Rwork and Rfree for highest resolution shell are now presented in the table 1.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The authors Howe et al., in their work about the fourth Dps from Nostoc punctiforme has tried to unravel its role in the organism and propose a new class of Dps, having His-type Ferroxidation centres unique to cyanobacteria. They also claim the NpDps4 uses O2 over H2O2 to oxidise iron. Also, crystal structures of apo, iron bound and zinc bound Dps has been analysed and they conclude by spectroscopic assays that binding of Zinc to the FOC inhibits ferroxidation.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s interesting to note the presence of a new type of ferroxidation site in cyanobacterial Dps, the authors could not make convincing theories about its possible biological significance. There are also some major points that the authors need to address regarding their other findings to make their claims credible.</p>
<p>The following points are raised in the order they occur in the text:</p>
<p>Line 142</p>
<p>The residues Phe95, Leu98 and Ala99 are mentioned in the text but not marked in the figure.</p>
<p>-We have made a new figure showing these hydrophobic interactions, to be found in the supplementary data named &#8216;S1 Fig&#8217;.</p>
<p>Line 157</p>
<p>&#8230; acid of the trio &#8230;</p>
<p>-We rephrased accordingly.</p>
<p>Lines 168-169</p>
<p>&#8220;each symmetrical amino acid of the trio is indicated only once&#8221;, but Figure 3B shows amino acids from all three monomers related by three-fold.</p>
<p>-We revised the sentence accordingly.</p>
<p>Line 174</p>
<p>How does the authors know SOKALAN66 is a metal chelating agent?</p>
<p>-This information was provided by the manufacturer, BASF, and we have also experimentally observed that SOKALAN HP66 severely interferes with preparing metal-soaked crystals. Note further that SOKALAN HP66 is a vinylpyrrolidone/vinylimidazole copolymer, i.e there is an abundance of imidazole functional groups, a well-known metal ion chelator. We have included this information to the manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 176</p>
<p>Is there any experimental evidence whether it is really Zinc or Iron bound in the crystal structure like anomalous X-ray scattering or even a simple detection of Zinc ions on a gel?</p>
<p>-The anomalous maps have been included in the supplementary information (S2 Figure) confirming the presence of metal ions in these sites, however it is not possible to distinguish between Zn and Fe using these maps. Due to the high concentrations of metals in the soaking solution we are convinced that the strong electron densities found in the metal binding site indeed represent Fe and Zn respectively. The  protein material, in which no metal could be found in the crystal, served as the basis for the soaking experiments. </p>
<p>Line 177</p>
<p>It would be more desirable to show electron density maps to show the fitting of ion atoms in Figure 4</p>
<p>-Electron density is now shown in the new supplemental figure named &#8216;S2_Figure&#8217;.</p>
<p>Line 189</p>
<p>Since the FOC is formed not only of residues from two monomers related by two-fold, but also from a third monomer it is also unusual for Dps proteins.</p>
<p>-We agree, and as the results and discussion sections are separated in this manuscript, we had included this statement in the discussion section of the revised manuscript </p>
<p>Lines 213-214</p>
<p>The sentence can be phrased better.</p>
<p>-We agree and we revised the sentence.</p>
<p>Line 220</p>
<p>What is the rationale of using 24 mM Fe2+ and 0.5 mM NpDps?</p>
<p>-At a ratio of 48 Fe2+/Dps protein all Fe2+ binding sites inside the Dps dodecamer could be theoretically occupied, as there are 12 FOC with each two iron binding sites per Dps protein (=24 Fe2+ / dodecamer binding sites). Now explained in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Lines 241-250</p>
<p>If the ferroxidation experiments using H2O2 were done under aerobic conditions, how does the authors discount for the effect of O2 on oxidation and especially as they&#8217;re comparing the ferroxidation properties between O2 and H2O2. It is strange that the graph doesn&#8217;t show any increase in ferroxidation under aerobic conditions, as in the above paragraph they show that oxygen can be used for ferroxidation by NpDps4.</p>
<p>-Yes we agree that this is a relevant comment. We did not discount for the effect of O2 on the reaction shown in Figure 5 B. It is likely that O2-mediated Fe2+ oxidation occurs in the presence of NpDps4, however this was not visible in the experiment. By using the same experimental set up we earlier observed a clear difference in the reaction between Fe2+ and H2O2 in the presence of NpDps1, NpDps2 and NpDps3 as compared to without protein (Howe et al. 2018). Thus showing a difference in Fe2+ oxidation in NpDps4 as compared to canonical Dps proteins.</p>
<p>It may be that NpDps4 utilises H2O2 for Fe2+ oxidation, but the catalytic effect has not been observed during the reaction as compared to the control in the absence of NpDps4. Changes in the text have been made accordingly.</p>
<p>Lines 262-263</p>
<p>Does the inhibition of ferroxidation by Zinc related to it causing protein aggregation as it is mentioned in line 263 that Zinc negatively impacts protein solubility?</p>
<p>-Currently we don&#8217;t see any relation between Zn2+ inhibition and this putative protein aggregation or precipitation process. </p>
<p>Additionally we show that the addition of Zn2+ during the course of the O2-mediated Fe2+ reaction quickly inhibited NpDps4 (Fig. 6B), a much faster response as compared to the slow gradual increase of the background absorption. We revised some sentences in the result part for clarity.</p>
<p>Lines 282-288</p>
<p>Addition of Zinc indicated by arrow is misleading in Figure 6B as the black graph shows the reaction without Zn addition. In line 287 the authors mean figure 6B and not 6A?</p>
<p>-We agree with the reviewer that the arrow might be misleading in the Figure 6 B. To emphasize that no Zn2+ was added in the black kinetic trace. The figure was modified for clarity: &#8220;In the presence of 0.5 &#181;M NpDps4 24 &#181;M Fe2+ was added to the reaction mixture (black graph) and no Zn2+ was added during the course of the reaction&#8221;. Further clarifications were done to the figure. </p>
<p>-Yes. It was meant 6 B, black graph, thank you!</p>
<p>Line 302</p>
<p>Figure 7 is illegible, and nothing can be inferred from it. So, the authors most important claim that the his-type FOC is conserved across cyanobacteria cannot be ascertained at all from the figure.</p>
<p>-The Figure was originally provided with 300 dpi. We provide the Figure now in 600 dpi.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we modified Figure 7 to highlight the variety of cyanobacteria, in which the His-type FOC was found. Figure 7 now contains further information about the strains&#8217; morphology (unicellular or filamentous), their capacity of forming heterocysts for N2- fixation and their origin - whether isolated in a marine or freshwater environment [Uyeda et al.]. We hope that the figure now better illustrate that the his-type FOC is (not conserved but) widely spread among cyanobacteria. </p>

<p>Line 392</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear to the reader what is &#8216;the specific function&#8217; in cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>-We agree that the sentence in L392 was not clear and we have now revised it.</p>
<p>Line 470</p>
<p>Recent developments on the dps-like interface and its role as an evolutionary switch between dps and ferritins has to be mentioned when discussing the role of this interface.</p>
<p>-The authors agree with reviewer #2 that the Dps-like interface displays a crucial structural element that evolutionarily is linked to maxiferritins. We included the following sentences at the end of the paragraph in the discussion section:</p>
<p>&#8220;However, the interface at the Dps-like pores has additionally been identified to be a crucial structural element that evolutionarily links maxiferritins with Dps proteins [56]. It was shown that a single mutation at this interface could render the dodecameric structure of a Dps protein into a maxiferritin during protein crystallization&#8221;   </p>
<p>Lines 620-621</p>
<p>During the ferroxidation experiment the authors talk of mixing the reaction by resuspension. How do they account for the reaction time that has elapsed during this process? Wherever possible cuvettes with stirrers should be used as these reaction rates can be pretty fast, especially the rates with H2O2.</p>
<p>-The spectroscopic data was collected to compare Fe-oxidation behaviour under different conditions and precise quantitative analysis was not the objective here. All the experiments have been conducted the same way and the time elapsed during mixing was between 8-10 sec long, for all experiments. By this experimental design we were able to determine qualitative differences. We did not attempt to extract kinetics and inhibitions parameters. Although very interesting, quantitation was not the aim of the ferroxidation analyses in this study.</p>
<p>Line 626</p>
<p>Ideally kinetic data should be evaluated from 3-4 experiments and at least two different protein preparations.</p>
<p>-The extraction of kinetic parameters for quantification was outside the scope of this manuscript and we performed two individual experiments for comparative qualitative analysis purposes (the replicate data is now included in the S1 file with raw data). For consistent we used the same protein material for both the crystallisation experiments and the spectroscopic experiment. Further experiments with  a protein preparation of Strep-tagged NpDps4 showed very similar qualitative results (not included in this manuscript).</p>
