<abstract>
<p>Studying bacterial population diversity is important to understand healthcare associated infections&#8217; epidemiology and has a significant impact on dealing with multidrug resistant bacterial outbreaks. We characterised the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing <italic>K</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (ESBLp KPN) population in our hospital using mini-MLST. Then we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to compare selected isolates belonging to the most prevalent melting types (MelTs) and the colonization/infection pair isolates collected from one patient to study the ESBLp KPN population&#8217;s genetic diversity. A total of 922 ESBLp KPN isolates collected between 7/2016 and 5/2018 were divided into 38 MelTs using mini-MLST with only 6 MelTs forming 82.8% of all isolates. For WGS, 14 isolates from the most prominent MelTs collected in the monitored period and 10 isolates belonging to the same MelTs collected in our hospital in 2014 were randomly selected. Resistome, virulome and ST were MelT specific and stable over time. A maximum of 23 SNV per core genome and 58 SNV per core and accessory genome were found. To determine the SNV relatedness cut-off values, 22 isolates representing colonization/infection pair samples obtained from 11 different patients were analysed by WGS with a maximum of 22 SNV in the core genome and 40 SNV in the core and accessory genome within pairs. The mini-MLST showed its potential for real-time epidemiology in clinical practice. However, for outbreak evaluation in a low diversity bacterial population, mini-MLST should be combined with more sensitive methods like WGS. Our findings showed there were only minimal differences within the core and accessory genome in the low diversity hospital population and gene based SNV analysis does not have enough discriminatory power to differentiate isolate relatedness. Thus, intergenic regions and mobile elements should be incorporated into the analysis scheme to increase discriminatory power.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (KPN) frequently causes community and hospital acquired infections including pneumonia, urinary tract infections and pyogenic liver abscesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref002">2</xref>]. The main KPN transmission reservoirs are the gastrointestinal tract and the hands of hospital personnel and patients. Nosocomial KPN isolates often display highly resistant phenotypes with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing (ESBLp) KPN prevalence between 2% and 55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref003">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Typing methods to discriminate different bacterial isolates from the same species are essential epidemiological tools. In populations with a high prevalence of ESBL, the knowledge of bacterial population structure and dynamics is especially important in outbreak detection and intervention. To monitor the bacterial population, cheap, rapid and robust methods are needed. In our previous study, we proved that mini-MLST, a method derived from multi locus sequence typing (MLST) in which costly and time-consuming sequencing is replaced with high resolution melting analysis, is suitable for long term prospective KPN population screening. Currently, besides KPN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref006">6</xref>], mini-MLST has been established for <italic>Staphyloccoccus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref007">7</xref>], <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref008">8</xref>] and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref009">9</xref>]. However, its lower discriminatory power makes mini-MLST insufficient to identify outbreak strains and it needs to be combined with more sensitive methods.</p>
<p>Recently, whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized our ability to differentiate between bacterial strains at the entire genome&#8217;s DNA sequence level. For bacterial typing, WGS has two major approaches&#8211;core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) and single nucleotide variant analysis (SNV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref010">10</xref>]. CgMLST is based on an allele numbering system of a pre-determined set of genes. An advantage of cgMLST&#8217;s approach is its inter-laboratory portability and the existence of public databases e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.cgmlst.org/ncs" ns0:type="simple">https://www.cgmlst.org/ncs</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/" ns0:type="simple">http://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/</ext-link> or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://pubmlst.org/" ns0:type="simple">https://pubmlst.org/</ext-link>. SNV analysis is based on mapping raw sequence reads against a reference genome and detecting nucleotides that vary within the dataset. This approach provides an even higher resolution power than cgMLST, but is far more computationally intensive than cgMLST analysis and interpreting the results is more complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>As generating WGS data become more accessible, rapid and cheap, bottlenecks remain in proper pre-sequencing sample selection and post-sequencing data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref011">11</xref>]. The main bottlenecks include the need to critically evaluate the raw sequencing data, some knowledge and skills in programming and improvements in data analysis to translate the enormous amount of obtained data into understandable results for health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref013">13</xref>]. Knowledge of the local bacterial population&#8217;s genetics characterisation is also crucial for the results to be correctly interpreted, as there are no general thresholds of relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The main objectives of this study were i) to characterise the ESBLp KPN population in our hospital using mini-MLST prospective typing ii) to evaluate core and accessory genome single nucleotide variant analysis contribution in possible outbreak detection within the low diversity ESBLp KPN hospital population.</p>

<p>The study was conducted at the University Hospital Brno (Brno, Czech Republic), a tertiary care hospital with more than 2,000 beds and 5,000 employees. There are more than 1,000,000 people treated in out-patient clinics and over 70,000 patients hospitalized every year. During the systematic strain collection between 7/2016 and 5/2018, we collected all ESBLp KPN isolates from high risk departments (Department of Internal Medicine&#8211;Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Geriatrics and Practical Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine) and all isolates from neonates, new-borns and children. In total, we collected 922 ESBLp KPN isolates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0221187.t001">Table 1</xref>). For the purposes of this study, 24 ESBLp KPN isolates from our previous study collected between 1/2014 and 10/2014 were also included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref014">14</xref>]. All isolates were collected during routine practice and were made completely anonymous.</p>

<p>Mini-MLST was performed with primers described by Andersson, Tong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref006">6</xref>] on a RotorGene 6000 platform (Corbett Research, Australia). The 20 &#956;L reaction volume contained 10 &#956;L 2&#215; SensiFAST HRM mix (Bioline Reagents, UK), 0.4 &#956;M of each primer, 1 &#956;L of extracted genomic DNA (30 ng) and deionized water to a final volume of 20 &#956;L. Thermo cycling parameters were: 95&#176;C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95&#176;C for 5 s, 65&#176;C for 10 s and 72&#176;C for 20 s, then one cycle of 95&#176;C for 2 min and 50&#176;C for 20 s, followed by HRM ramping from 70 to 95&#176;C, increasing by 0.2&#176;C at each step.

<title>Mini-MLST</title>
<p>For hospital population characterisation, we used mini-MLST to type all collected isolates. Overall, 38 different MelTs were identified among 922 ESBLp KPN isolates collected between 7/2016 and 5/2018. MelT145 (30.8%, n = 284), MelT26 (25.9%, n = 239), MelT132 (8.0%, n = 74), MelT139 (7.7%, n = 71), MelT269 (5.4%, n = 50), MelT281 (5.0%, n = 46), MelT266 (2.6%, n = 24) and MelT20 (2.3%, n = 21) were the most predominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221187.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The remaining 30 MelTs were present in less than 2% of all isolates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221187.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the proportions of certain MelTs in our hospital population are quite stable (MelT145, MelT26), while an increase (MelT132) or decrease (MelT139) can be observed in others. Mini-MLST&#8217;s discriminatory power was D = 0.8189. The mini-MLST results were used for basic population sorting and WGS sample selection.</p>

<p>We randomly selected 14 isolates from the four most predominant MelTs from 7/2016-5/2018 (3 MelT145 isolates, 5 MelT26 isolates, 3 MelT132 isolates and 3 MelT139 isolates). Because these MelTs were also present in our hospital during our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref014">14</xref>], we added 10 isolates isolated in our hospital in 2014 (3 MelT145 isolates, 1 MelT26 isolate, 3 MelT132 isolates and 3 MelT139 isolates).</p>
<p>To set SNV relatedness cut-off values, 22 isolates representing colonization (rectal swab)/infection (blood culture) pair samples obtained from 11 different patients were analysed using WGS. Pair sample isolates belonged to 6 different MelTs (2 MelT26 isolates, 2 MelT130 isolates, 6 MelT132 isolates, 6 MelT145 isolates, 4 MelT266 isolates and 2 MelT281 isolates).

<title>cgMLST and SNV analysis</title>
<p>CgMLST analysis provides more discriminatory power than traditional MLST. In this study, we used a cgMLST scheme consisting of 2,358 targets processed by Ridom SeqSphere+ software (Ridom, DE). A cgMLST dendrogram based on 2,251 targets present in all analysed strains was constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221187.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The other 107 targets from the original 2,358 targets were absent in some or all of the strains and were excluded from all further analyses. The cgMLST divided 46 isolates into 7 clearly distinguishable clusters corresponding to their MelTs groups, with two exceptions. The S13 isolate differed from the other MelT26 isolates in 584 targets, while the average number of different alleles within the other MelTs ranged from 0 to 19 differences between two samples of the same MelT. The second exception was MelT132, which was divided into two subpopulations with 127 different alleles between them. Both exceptions correlated with the previous <italic>in silico</italic> MLST and resistome and virulome analysis. The average number of different alleles between individual MelTs was 1827 (range from 1809 to 1844 differences).</p>
<p>SNV analysis was carried out for both a core genome (n = 2,251 genes present in all analysed strains) and core with accessory genome (n = 4,084 genes present in all analysed strains). In the core genome, 29,535 SNV positions were identified in total. In general, the core genome SNV number inside each MelT varies from 0 to 23 SNV (MelT145 0&#8211;23 SNV, n = 12; MelT139 0&#8211;21 SNV, n = 8; MelT26 0&#8211;20 SNV, n = 8; MelT266 0&#8211;14 SNV, n = 4; MelT132 cluster A 0&#8211;22 SNV, n = 5; MelT132 cluster B 0&#8211;4 SNV, n = 6; MelT281 0 SNV, n = 2 and MelT130 0 SNV, n = 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221187.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

<title>Infection and colonisation pair isolates analysis</title>
<p>We analysed 11 pairs (each pair included a rectal swab and a blood culture) of ESBLp KPN isolates obtained from 11 patients to set the SNV cut-off, which determined the relatedness of isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221187.g002">Fig 2</xref>). From 22 ESBLp KPN isolates, 6 distinct STs were identified: ST405 (n = 6), ST433 (n = 6), ST323 (n = 4), ST1271 (n = 2), ST458 (n = 2) and ST23 (n = 2). The isolates from each patient share the same ST within the pair. The core genome&#8217;s SNV number within each pair varies in range from 0 to 22 SNV, while together with the accessory genome&#8217;s SNV number, varies in range from 0 to 40 SNV. Based on paired sample analysis, we established relatedness cut-off values for our ESBLp KPN population as the highest SNV number within pair isolates, 22 SNV for the core genome and 40 SNV for the core with the accessory genome. Both the highest SNV values were for pair S39/S40 that had time lapses between samples of 47 days. The next highest SNV values were only 3 SNVs for the core genome and 5 SNVs for the core and accessory genome, despite time lapses of up to 90 days."</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We are currently using the following protocol in routine practice. ESBLp KPN collected from high-risk departments are prospectively tested with mini-MLST to determine the MelT. When the strains MelT differ, transmission is unlikely. When we observe an increased incidence of one MelT, we investigate the potential epidemiological linkages and then we decide if there is a possible outbreak and need for WGS analysis. Meanwhile, early epidemiological measures can be implemented to prevent further spread of infection.</p>
<p>KPN mini-MLST is a cheap, rapid and robust method for epidemiological strain typing introduced by Andersson, Tong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref006">6</xref>], with advantages in its robustness, reproducibility and portability between laboratories as it is based on a well-established MLST method. In studies with a large number of samples, mini-MLST also can be used for sample sorting and pre-selecting for more detailed analysis. We evaluated this method for prospective ESBLp KPN population screening and to solve healthcare associated infection outbreaks in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref014">14</xref>]. During the mini-MLST results evaluation, we were unable to determine the MelT of several isolates as their mini-MLST allele combination did not corresponded to any MelT in the published conversion key. On the date of the original article publication there were 863 STs, while in 7/2019 there were 4126 STs, from which it was not possible to determine some of the newly described STs&#8217; MelT according to the original conversion key. Following this, we constructed a new automatic algorithm (applicable to already existing and future-designed mini-MLST schemes) and created a new conversion key that will be regularly updated. The latest version of the key is available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.cmbgt.cz/mini-mlst/t6353" ns0:type="simple">http://www.cmbgt.cz/mini-mlst/t6353</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Based on our previous study, we started prospective screening in certain departments of our hospital in 7/2016. Since then, we have observed six MelTs account for 82.8% of isolates, from a total of 38 MelTs identified between 7/2016 and 5/2018 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221187.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The most pronounced changes in proportional representation were observed in MelT145 (from 38.1% in 2016 to 29.5% in 2018), MelT139 (from 10.9% in 2016 to 3.6% in 2018), MelT132 (from 2.5% in 2016 to 4.7% in 2018) and MelT266 (from 1.7% in 2016 to 5.2% in 2018). We did not detect any emerging MelT which spread to more than 1% of the study population. This suggests a relatively stable low diversity bacterial population which cannot be divided more by using the mini-MLST method only and needs methods with more discriminatory power.</p>
<p>WGS has become a powerful method for most epidemiological studies and hospital outbreak investigations, as it provides multiple analyses from a single technique, including data on MLST, resistant genes, virulence genes, plasmids and genome comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref018">18</xref>]. Currently, epidemiological investigations have mainly focused on an allele-based approach (cgMLST, wgMLST) and SNV analysis. While the allele-based approach is particularly suitable for multicentre studies and clustering large populations of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref019">19</xref>], SNV analysis is especially useful when dealing with outbreak episodes where we are expecting the analysed strains to be similar. The number of differences in alleles or SNV that still identify isolates as similar or related and include them in outbreak episodes differs in various publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref011">11</xref>]. According to our best knowledge, there are no general standards or rules to set a sufficient threshold value. For this reason, it is not possible to simply compare the results of individual studies and freely use previously published cut-off values, the cut-off being typically determined based on the specific results from those publications and mostly varying between 0 and several dozen SNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref010">10</xref>]. Also, comparing outbreak strains and the local bacterial population is not commonly done in most studies, which may give important information to determine relatedness and assess outbreaks.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the role of WGS in low diversity population outbreak analysis, we sequenced 46 ESBLp KPN isolates belonging to the four mostly spread MelTs from the monitored period from 7/2016 to 5/2018, isolates from the same MelTs originally collected for our mini-MLST pilot study in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref014">14</xref>] and colonization/infection pair samples. First, we performed in silico MLST to correlate the STs with MelTs and characterise our population in the worldwide KPN population context. All predominant STs in our population have previously been described in literature. Serotype K1 strains belonging to ST23 (MelT281) were described as a frequent cause of invasive infections and liver abscesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref020">20</xref>]. ST321 (MelT139), ST323 (MelT266), ST1271 (MelT26) and ST29 (MelT26) were described as long-term, persistent MDR strains in hospital facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref021">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref023">23</xref>]. ST405 (MelT132) was often described as an OXA-48 producer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref024">24</xref>] and ST433 (MelT145) as hyper virulent biofilm producing strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref025">25</xref>]. The only discrepancy between MLST and mini-MLST was in sample 13, which belonged to ST29, in contrast with the other MelT26 isolates, which belonged to ST1271. S13 was the only MelT26 isolate collected in 2014.</p>
<p>Second, we used public online databases to determine the profile of resistance genes, virulence factor genes and efflux pump genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221187.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Compared to the mini-MLST results, resistome, virulome and efflux pump gene analysis only separated S13 from others belonging to MelT26 (as well as MLST) and divided MelT132 into two clearly separate clusters (Isolates from clusters A and B from MelT132 both belonged to ST405). In summary, these analyses do not have sufficient discriminatory power for the epidemiology of low diversity hospital bacterial populations. However, they provide information on the resistance and virulence of the examined strains, which can help manage the spread of hyper-resistant and hyper-virulent strains and may be useful in patients&#8217; treatment.</p>
<p>The cgMLST provides more discriminatory power than previously mentioned analyses, since it is based on hundreds or thousands KPN genes&#8217; allelic similarities depending on the study&#8217;s design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref026">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref028">28</xref>]. Despite analysing 2,251 genes, we did not find enough allelic differences between isolates belonging to the same MelT to draw a conclusion about isolate relatedness.</p>
<p>To analyse the SNV analysis results, we have to set the SNV cut-off values to determine ESBLp KPN isolate similarity. We used the general premise that the colonization strain is in most cases the cause of the subsequent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221187.ref030">30</xref>]. Therefore, the number of SNV between colonization/infection pair isolates defines the value of the difference level at which the isolates can still be considered similar. Based on our results, we established two sets of cut-off values. The first set was based on all pairs and cut-off values were 22 SNV for the core genome and 40 SNV for the core and accessory genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221187.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The stricter cut-offs were set with excluded SNV values for pair S39/S40 and values were 3 SNV for the core genome and 5 SNV for the core and accessory genome. Both cut-off values set reflected the low diversity in the highly selective ESBLp KPN hospital population. Using both of our cut-off values on our population, even isolates without evident epidemiological associations were clustered together, which makes evaluating outbreaks difficult and may lead to erroneous conclusions.</p>
<p>We are aware that our study is a single-centre study with a small number of isolates sequenced. Especially to determine cut-off, more paired isolates should be analysed. However, due to the specific hospital&#8217;s environment, we can expect highly-selected bacterial populations to also be found in other hospitals.</p>
<p>To our best knowledge, this is the first study where prospective molecular typing is combined with WGS to define the epidemiological background and the genetic structure of the hospital&#8217;s bacterial population. We proved that mini-MLST is a cost effective means of ruling out epidemiological linkage, but only complete genome analysis can provide strong evidence in favour of epidemiological linkage. Our findings showed there were only minimal differences within the core/accessory genome in the low diversity hospital population and gene based SNV analysis does not have enough discriminatory power to differentiate isolates&#8217; relatedness or evaluate whether it is an outbreak or not. Thus, intergenic regions and mobile elements should be incorporated to the analysis scheme to increase the discriminatory power. Therefore, when evaluating any molecular biological data, it is necessary to analyse them to concord with the epidemiological background.</p>

<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p><bold>Journal Requirements:</bold></p>
<p>1. When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ns0:type="simple">http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>2. Our editorial staff has assessed your submission, and we have concerns about the grammar, usage, and overall readability of the manuscript. &#160;We therefore request that you revise the text to fix the grammatical errors and improve the overall readability of the text before we send it for review. We suggest you have a fluent, preferably native, English-language speaker thoroughly copyedit your manuscript for language usage, spelling, and grammar.</p>
<p>If you do not know anyone who can do this, you may wish to consider employing a professional scientific editing service. &#160;</p>
<p>Whilst you may use any professional scientific editing service of your choice, PLOS has partnered with both American Journal Experts (AJE) and Editage to provide discounted services to PLOS authors. Both organizations have experience helping authors meet PLOS guidelines and can provide language editing, translation, manuscript formatting, and figure formatting to ensure your manuscript meets our submission guidelines. To take advantage of our partnership with AJE, visit the AJE website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://learn.aje.com/plos/" ns0:type="simple">http://learn.aje.com/plos/</ext-link>) and enter referral code PLOS15 for a 15% discount off AJE services. To take advantage of our partnership with Editage, visit the Editage website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.editage.com" ns0:type="simple">www.editage.com</ext-link>) and enter referral code PLOSEDIT for a 15% discount off Editage services. If the PLOS editorial team finds any language issues in text that either AJE or Editage has edited, the service provider will re-edit the text for free.</p>
<p>Upon resubmission, please provide the following:</p>
<p>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;The name of the colleague or the details of the professional service that edited your manuscript</p>
<p>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;A copy of your manuscript showing your changes by either highlighting them or using track changes (uploaded as a *supporting information* file)</p>
<p>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;A clean copy of the edited manuscript (uploaded as the new *manuscript* file)</p>
<p>Please note that PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts and that one of our criteria for publication is that articles must be presented in an intelligible fashion and written in clear, correct, and unambiguous English (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/publication#language" ns0:type="simple">http://www.plosone.org/static/publication#language</ext-link>). If the language is not sufficiently improved, we may have no choice but to reject the manuscript without review.</p>
<p><bold>Comments to the Author</bold></p>
<p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
<p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: N/A</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
<p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ns0:type="simple">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
<p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript is particularly well written and describes an interesting and well-designed study. My comments are quite minor.</p>
<p>&#8226; Not sure where the sequence data/sequence reads are deposited</p>
<p>&#8226; The figure legends are short and uninformative. I know they should not repeat was in the text, but I was having trouble understanding exactly how each figure was put together. Perhaps just a little more information is necessary. One thing that was specifically unclear was whether the dendrogram in Fig 3 was on the basis of allele number similarity, or overall sequence similarity. Similarly, it appears from the Methods that allele numbers were used to create the minimum spanning trees in Fig 4 &#8211; which seems odd given that the Results implies it is from actual sequence similarity. Can this be clarified?</p>
<p>&#8226; Can the authors give some thought to shortening the Discussion? The main points conclusions could possibly be stated more clearly and succinctly e.g. &#8220;miniMLST is a cost effective means of ruling out epidemiological linkage, but only complete genome analysis can provide strong evidence in favour of epidemiological linkage&#8221;.</p>

<p>Reviewer #2: Title: Application of whole genome sequencing in low diversity hospital extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing Klebsiella pneumoniae population</p>
<p>This manuscript presents a well written description of the application of mini-MLST in the surveillance of ESBL-KPN within a single hospital in the Czech Republic. Additionally, the authors discuss the limitations of mini-MLST in resolving closely related isolates, in particular outbreak strains, and the need for WGS in these situations. The authors then show the potential application of WGS in a limited sample set.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>Line 52 &#8211; the word &#8220;solution&#8221; should likely be &#8220;intervention&#8221;.</p>
<p>Line 237-238 &#8211; The authors indicate they have generated a new automatic algorithm that acts as a conversion key. Is it possible to utilize this conversion key with the existing MLST schema to generate a conversion list of MSLT to melT groups? This would allow for direct comparison of the large existing studies that use MLST with the use of melT groups and will also clarify the resolution of melT groups. I think this would help clarify the potential role of melT groups among a growing list of molecular epidemiology markers of bacterial diversity (e.g. PFGE, MLST, mini-MLST, cgMLST, WGS).</p>
<p>Line 63-65 &#8211; The authors define CgMLST and SNV analyses, but the descriptions are confusing. In particular, the authors indicate SNV analysis provides a higher resolution power as compared to cgMLST, but then use SNV as a precursor to CgMLST. It would be good to clarify that both are based upon the detection of variants, but while CgMLST is looking at variants in a specific pre-determined set of genes, true whole genome alignment allows for assessment of variants in all regions that are not masked.</p>
<p>Table 1.- Can the authors please include the percentage of each subgrouping with the count? This will help the reader understand the proportion of isolates, especially within the source section of the table.</p>
<p>Lines 95-97 &#8211; the methods listed for use with mini-MLST differ from the methods used in the previous reference within Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease (citation 14). Can the authors comment on why the methods were changed from the UltraClean Microbial DNA Isolation Kit to the Chelex based extraction?</p>
<p>Line 122 &#8211; Can the authors indicate how they defined ambiguous positions? Was this based upon a percent threshold for variant detection?</p>
<p>Line 235 &#8211; please update the number of ST types as it now appears there are 4,054 different MSLT profiles within the Pasteur MLST database.</p>
<p>Line 249 &#8211; Please update the sentence to say &#8220;WGS has become a powerful method&#8221;</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>Title &#8211; As this manuscript focuses heavily on mini-MLST, please add mini-MLST to the title.</p>
<p>Lines 35-37, 57-59, 318-323 &#8211; The authors describe the potential for mini-MLST in real-time epidemiology, but point out the need for mini-MLST to be combined with more discriminatory analyses in outbreak/low genetic diversity settings. Can the authors describe in more detail how this progressive application of mini-MLST and WGS would work in active surveillance? In specific, it would be good to identify how mini-MLST could be used to select isolates for WGS and how mini-MLST would be able to identify outbreaks to focus on.</p>
<p>Lines 146-156 &#8211; Do the authors intend to submit the WGS sequencing data to a repository such as the European Nucleotide Archive? If so, can the authors include the project ID within the manuscript?</p>
<p>Line 215-217 &#8211; What was the order of collection for the colonization and infection strains? Were colonization strains always collected before outbreak strains? This may be good information to include in a supplemental table. Additionally, can the authors discuss the number of remaining positions within the genome that are accounted for in calculating the number of SNVs between each pair of isolates?</p>
<p>Line 271-275 &#8211; Can the authors make it more clear if this discussion is referring to the 14 isolates described on lines 146-147, the 24 isolates described from lines 146-150, or does this refer to the entire set of 46 isolates (line 155)? If this is either the 14 or 24 isolates, this represents a small subset of the overall 922 isolates. Can the authors discuss the possibility that this is not a broad enough subsample of the total set of ESBL-KPN isolates to truly evaluate the role of WGS in a low diversity population?</p>
<p>Line 301-310 &#8211; I am confused about the application of the premise that &#8220;the colonization strain is the cause of the subsequent infection in most cases&#8221; to the idea of evaluating a hospital outbreak. In particular, hospital outbreaks are characterized by person-to-person transmission, or are mediated by fomites in the environment. Can the authors describe the potential for misclassification of colonizing and infecting strains if the infecting strain was acquired within the hospital environment?</p>
<p>In a time where there is more focus on acquired resistance genes, and in particular how these acquired genes can change the required antimicrobial treatment choices, how can a technique like mini-MLST be used to help target hospital infection control in the case of an outbreak?</p>
<p>Figure 2 &#8211; This figure is very data dense, but does not display well on a single printed page. Additionally, as the discussion of virulence factors is limited within the manuscript, it may be good to reformat this figure or move it to the supplemental files.</p>

<p>&#8226; The figure legends are short and uninformative. I know they should not repeat was in the text, but I was having trouble understanding exactly how each figure was put together. Perhaps just a little more information is necessary. One thing that was specifically unclear was whether the dendrogram in Fig 3 was on the basis of allele number similarity, or overall sequence similarity. Similarly, it appears from the Methods that allele numbers were used to create the minimum spanning trees in Fig 4 &#8211; which seems odd given that the Results implies it is from actual sequence similarity. Can this be clarified? </p>
<p>Line 193-199; Line 213-217 - We added short legends to Fig 2 and Fig 3 (formerly Fig 3 and Fig 4). We also clarified allele/sequence similarity in the Methods and Results sections. We transferred Fig 2 to the Table and moved it to the supplemental files (S1 Table).</p>
<p>&#8226; Can the authors give some thought to shortening the Discussion? The main point&#8217;s conclusions could possibly be stated more clearly and succinctly e.g. &#8220;miniMLST is a cost effective means of ruling out epidemiological linkage, but only complete genome analysis can provide strong evidence in favour of epidemiological linkage&#8221;. </p>

<p>Line 259-260 - Once you have designed the mini-MLST scheme the algorithm is applicable to any MLST scheme. To run the algorithm, you need a list of ST including allele variants; FASTA file of all genes used in mini-MLST scheme and mini-MLST primers sequences. Added to the manuscript.</p>

<p>As we process a large number of isolates we were looking for a more efficient DNA extraction method. Chelex based extraction costs $ 0.5 per sample and takes less than 30 minutes with minimum hands-on time. UltraClean Microbial DNA Isolation Kit costs $ 5 per sample, takes about 60 minutes and requires more hands-on time. The quality and concentration of DNA extracted with Chelex is suitable for use in PCR methods.    </p>

<p>Major comments : </p>
<p>Title &#8211; As this manuscript focuses heavily on mini-MLST, please add mini-MLST to the title. Title, line 1 - Title updated to &#8220;Application of mini-MLST and whole genome sequencing in low diversity hospital extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing Klebsiella pneumoniae population&#8221;</p>
<p>Lines 35-37, 57-59, 318-323 &#8211; The authors describe the potential for mini-MLST in real-time epidemiology, but point out the need for mini-MLST to be combined with more discriminatory analyses in outbreak/low genetic diversity settings.

In specific, it would be good to identify how mini-MLST could be used to select isolates for WGS and how mini-MLST would be able to identify outbreaks to focus on. Line 242-247 - The following paragraph was added to the discussion.</p>
<p>We are currently using the following protocol in routine practice. ESBLp KPN collected from high-risk departments are prospectively tested with mini-MLST to determine MelT. When the strains&#8217; MelT differ, transmission is unlikely. When we observe an increased incidence of one MelT, we check the potential epidemiological linkages and then we decide if there is a possible outbreak and need of WGS analysis. Meanwhile, early epidemiological measures can be implemented to prevent further spread of infection.</p>
<p>Lines 146-156 &#8211; Do the authors intend to submit the WGS sequencing data to a repository such as the European Nucleotide Archive? If so, can the authors include the project ID within the manuscript? Line 119-121 - Data accession for our project was updated in the manuscript. All raw sequencing data are available under the accession number PRJNA515630 in the BioProject database (direct link was also added to the revised manuscript <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA515630" ns0:type="simple">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA515630</ext-link>.) </p>
<p>&#8226; Line 215-217 &#8211; What was the order of collection for the colonization and infection strains? Were colonization strains always collected before outbreak strains? This may be good information to include in a supplemental table. Additionally, can the authors discuss the number of remaining positions within the genome that are accounted for in calculating the number of SNVs between each pair of isolates? Fig 2, Line 193 - Collection dates are listed in Fig 2 and also in S1 Table. In one case the rectum isolate was collected three days before the blood culture isolate and in one case the rectum isolate was collected sixteen days before the blood culture isolate. All other colonization isolates were collected before blood culture isolates. </p>
<p>In total 4,179,387 positions were used in SNV analysis. For core genome SNV analysis only, 2,042,000 positions were analysed. We added S2 and S3 Tables to supplementary files, which show SNV distance matrix for all 46 samples for core genome SNV and core and accessory genome SNV respectively.</p>
<p>&#8226; Line 271-275 &#8211; Can the authors make it more clear if this discussion is referring to the 14 isolates described on lines 146-147, the 24 isolates described from lines 146-150, or does this refer to the entire set of 46 isolates (line 155)? If this is either the 14 or 24 isolates, this represents a small subset of the overall 922 isolates. Can the authors discuss the possibility that this is not a broad enough subsample of the total set of ESBL-KPN isolates to truly evaluate the role of WGS in a low diversity population? </p>
<p>Line 287-290 - This part of the discussion is referring to all 46 sequenced isolates. We clarified this in the relevant part of the discussion. </p>
<p>Our further project will focus on more detailed analysis of the most predominant MelTs, including sequencing of a larger isolate set, long reads sequencing and also plasmid analysis.</p>
<p>&#8226; Line 301-310 &#8211; I am confused about the application of the premise that &#8220;the colonization strain is the cause of the subsequent infection in most cases&#8221; to the idea of evaluating a hospital outbreak.

Can the authors describe the potential for misclassification of colonizing and infecting strains if the infecting strain was acquired within the hospital environment? </p>
<p>Line 314-318 - The number of SNV between colonization/infection pair isolates defines the value of the difference level at which the isolates can still be considered. </p>
<p>We clarified this in the relevant part of the discussion. </p>
<p>In our study (and hospital), the infecting strain is collected from blood culture, urine or other primary sterile material. If the patient has an infection with his own colonizing strain, it is possible to tell only when we also have an isolate from this patient from a previous collection.</p>
<p>&#8226; In a time where there is more focus on acquired resistance genes, and in particular how these acquired genes can change the required antimicrobial treatment choices, how can a technique like mini-MLST be used to help target hospital infection control in the case of an outbreak? </p>
<p>Using knowledge of the local population, its stability and epidemiological linkages along with rapid prospective screening can help implement initial epidemiological measures or find and eliminate a potential outbreak source.  As such, the Mini-MLST does not provide information on antibiotic resistance genes. However, information on the resistant genes&#8217; presence in certain MelT acquired by the WGS along with the fact that the hospital population seems to be relatively stable over the long term can be used to predict the resistome of the examined strains. However, to confirm, the strains resistome needs to be examined by specific PCR or WGS.</p>
<p>&#8226; Figure 2 &#8211; This figure is very data dense, but does not display well on a single printed page. Additionally, as the discussion of virulence factors is limited within the manuscript, it may be good to reformat this figure or move it to the supplemental files. </p>

<p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>*should read "beta-lactamase producing", not plural "beta-lactamases producing"</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>*lines 32, 35, 39, referring to the analysis of core and accessory genes as "core/accessory" is ambiguous in the abstract, please state as "core and accessory" as done elsewhere in the text</p>
<p>Intro</p>
<p>*first 2 sentences are very poorly constructed, please revise</p>
<p>*line 65, suggested wording "of a pre-determined set of.."</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>*lines 133, 134 suggested wording of "aligned nucleotide sites" instead of ambiguous term "positions"</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>*where is Fig 1? I did not see it in the files attached to this paper</p>
<p>*line 175 previous wording is better, suggested wording "(including separation of isolate S13 from other isolates)"</p>
<p>*lines 187 and 190 "average number of different alleles" is more precise language, please revise as appropriate</p>
<p>*Fig3 shows a major topology difference between panels A (core) and B (core and accessory)&#160;in the switching of the position of the MelT281, ST23 isolates and MelT132, ST405 isolates. This should be mentioned.</p>
<p>*line 234 suggested wording "Based on paired sample analysis,..."</p>
<p>*lines 237 to 240 wording is unclear. Do the authors mean "Both the highest SNV values were for pair S39/S40 that had time lapses between samples of 47 days. The next highest SNV values were only 3 SNVs for the core and 5 SNVs for the core and accessory, despite time lapses of up to 90 days." Please revise as appropriate.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>*line 263 suggested wording "Since then, we have observed six MelTs that account for 82.8% of isolates, from a total of 38 MelTs..."</p>
<p>*line 276 instead of "big bacterial populations", suggested wording "large populations of bacteria"</p>
<p>Overall</p>
<p>*Fig2 legend,&#160;Same issue as raised by Reviewer1, is the tree based on number of shared alleles or the sequence similarity in the shared alleles?&#160;Mostly likely, this legend should include "is based on sharing of 2,251 core genome targets." Please revise as appropriate.</p>

<p>Title </p>
<p>&#8226; Should read "beta-lactamase producing", not plural "beta-lactamases producing" </p>
<p>o Line 1 - Title corrected</p>
<p>Abstract </p>
<p>&#8226; Lines 32, 35, 39, referring to the analysis of core and accessory genes as "core/accessory" is ambiguous in the abstract, please state as "core and accessory" as done elsewhere in the text </p>
<p>o Lines 32, 35 and 39 - Text corrected</p>
<p>Introduction </p>
<p>&#8226; First 2 sentences are very poorly constructed, please revise </p>
<p>o Line 44-49 &#8211; Text corrected</p>
<p>&#8226; Line 65, suggested wording "of a pre-determined set of.." </p>
<p>o Line 65 &#8211; Text corrected</p>
<p>Methods </p>
<p>&#8226; Lines 133, 134 suggested wording of "aligned nucleotide sites" instead of ambiguous term "positions" </p>
<p>o Line 133 and 134 &#8211; Text corrected</p>
<p>Results </p>
<p>&#8226; Where is Fig 1? I did not see it in the files attached to this paper </p>
<p>o Fig 1 is uploaded in the attachment files</p>
<p>&#8226; Line 175 previous wording is better, suggested wording "(including separation of isolate S13 from other isolates)" </p>
<p>o Line 175-176 &#8211; Text corrected</p>
<p>&#8226; Lines 187 and 190 "average number of different alleles" is more precise language, please revise as appropriate </p>
<p>o Lines 187 and 190 &#8211; Text corrected</p>
<p>&#8226; Fig3 shows a major topology difference between panels A (core) and B (core and accessory) in the switching of the position of the MelT281, ST23 isolates and MelT132, ST405 isolates. This should be mentioned. </p>
<p>o Lines 229-233 &#8211; This information was added to the manuscript</p>
<p>&#8226; Line 234 suggested wording "Based on paired sample analysis,..." </p>
<p>o Line 239 &#8211; Text corrected</p>
<p>&#8226; Lines 237 to 240 wording is unclear. Do the authors mean "Both the highest SNV values were for pair S39/S40 that had time lapses between samples of 47 days. The next highest SNV values were only 3 SNVs for the core and 5 SNVs for the core and accessory, despite time lapses of up to 90 days." Please revise as appropriate. </p>
<p>o Lines 242 to 244 &#8211; Text corrected</p>
<p>Discussion </p>
<p>&#8226; Line 263 suggested wording "Since then, we have observed six MelTs that account for 82.8% of isolates, from a total of 38 MelTs..." </p>
<p>o Line 267-268 &#8211; Text corrected</p>
<p>&#8226; Line 276 instead of "big bacterial populations", suggested wording "large populations of bacteria" </p>
<p>o Line 280 &#8211; Text corrected</p>
<p>Overall </p>
<p>&#8226; Fig2 legend, Same issue as raised by Reviewer1, is the tree based on number of shared alleles or the sequence similarity in the shared alleles? Mostly likely, this legend should include "is based on sharing of 2,251 core genome targets." Please revise as appropriate. </p>
<p>o Line 194 &#8211; Fig 2 legend revised</p>
