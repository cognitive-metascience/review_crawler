<abstract>
<p>Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are multi-nutrient products used to increase the energy and nutrient intakes of patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether or not the adherence of patients varies according to their receiving prescription or over-the-counter ONS. Data were obtained from an online cross-sectional survey conducted with patients in Japan. A total of 107 patients who matched the inclusion criteria for the prescription ONS group and 148 who matched the criteria for the over-the-counter ONS group were further analyzed. In the prescription and over-the-counter ONS groups, the main medical reason for ONS consumption were &#8220;malnutrition&#8221; (48 patients [44.9%] vs. 63 patients [42.6%] p = 0.798], &#8220;frailty&#8221; (29 patients [27.1%] vs. 36 patients [24.3%] p = 0.663) and &#8220;aging&#8221; (25 patients [23.4%] vs. 30 patients [20.3%] p = 0.644). The proportion of &#8220;No particular disease&#8221; for prescription ONS consumption was significantly lower than that for over-the-counter ONS (6 patients [5.6%] vs. 24 patients [16.2%] p = 0.001). The body mass index of the prescription ONS group was significantly higher than that of the over-the-counter ONS group (21.1&#177;4.38 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs. 19.9&#177;3.75 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.0161). In the prescription ONS group, all patients were given medical advice by doctors or registered dietitians. In contrast, in the over-the-counter ONS group, only 46 patients (31.1%) were given advice by doctors or registered dietitians (p&lt;0.001). In the prescription ONS group, ONS was taken significantly more times and for a longer duration than in the over-the-counter ONS group (p&lt;0.0001). However, among patients given advice by doctors or registered dietitians, there were no significant differences between the groups. Greater support by the medical team is still needed in order to maximize adherence to supplementation, especially concerning the calories, timing and period, so that benefits can be achieved and sustained.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are multi-nutrient products (ready-made liquid, pudding or powder to be mixed with fluids) used to increase the energy and nutrient intakes of patients, especially those with malnutrition and at nutritional risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref001">1</xref>]. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) introduced the concept of ONS to the ESPEN guidelines on enteral nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref002">2</xref>]. ONS are defined as supplementary oral products consumed along with the normal diet for special medical purposes.</p>
<p>In meta-analyses, ONS have been shown to be clinically effective in some patient groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref003">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref007">7</xref>], such as malnourished geriatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref004">4</xref>], whereas a Cochrane review on disease-related malnutrition found no major differences in morbidity or mortality between patients receiving dietary advice and those prescription ONS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref008">8</xref>]. The ESPEN guidelines strongly recommend that malnourished polymorbid medical inpatients or those at high risk of malnutrition who can safely reach their nutritional requirements orally be considered for ONS high in energy and protein in order to improve their nutritional status and quality of life. It further recommends that nutrient-specific ONS be administered to malnourished polymorbid medical inpatients or those at high risk of malnutrition when they may maintain muscle mass, reduce mortality or improve their quality of life with such a prescription, and that ONS be considered for polymorbid medical inpatients who are malnourished or at high risk of malnutrition and can safely reach their nutritional requirements orally as a cost-effective intervention method for improving outcomes. A variety of benefits have been found for ONS use, including reduced length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref010">10</xref>], inpatient episode cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref010">10</xref>], complication rates, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref012">12</xref>] depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref013">13</xref>], and readmission rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref015">15</xref>], and improved lean body mass recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref016">16</xref>]. However, the use of ONS has also been questioned due to low adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref018">18</xref>] and a lack of beneficial results for some patient groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref019">19</xref>]. The effectiveness of nutrition therapy using ONS varies due to unstable patient adherence to the prescription, but a higher adherence to ONS has been associated with a higher energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref021">21</xref>] and an increase in body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>ONS often contain macronutrients as energy and protein and micronutrients as vitamins and minerals at varying concentrations. ONS that are registered as pharmaceuticals are only available by prescription, ideally following advice from a doctor. Therefore, individual dietetic assessments take into account a patient&#8217;s nutritional requirements in order to ensure a tailored prescription. However, some ONS that are registered as foodstuffs are available as over-the-counter purchases in supermarkets or pharmacies without doctors or registered dietitians in Japan. No previous studies have compared the outcomes of two types of ONS &#8220;prescription versus over-the-counter ONS&#8221;.</p>
<p>The aims of this study were the examination of difference between outpatients consumed prescription ONS and those consumed over-the-counter ONS and adherence to prescription ONS prescribed by a doctor and to over-the-counter ONS purchased by themselves.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>Data were obtained from an online cross-sectional survey conducted with patients in Japan. The survey was hosted by the market research company EPOCA Marketing Co., Ltd., which recruited samples from 2.2 million people registered with the company intended to be representative of the Japan population. Prescription ONS were registered in Japan as follows; Elental<sup>&#174;</sup> (EA Pharma Co., Ltd, Japan), Elental P<sup>&#174;</sup> (EA Pharma Co., Ltd, Japan), Ensure Liquid<sup>&#174;</sup> (Abbott Japan Co., Ltd., Japan), Ensure H<sup>&#174;</sup> (Abbott Japan Co., Ltd.), Enevo<sup>&#174;</sup> (Abbott Japan Co., Ltd.), Twinline-NF<sup>&#174;</sup> (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan), Racol-NF<sup>&#174;</sup> (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan). Over-the-counter ONS are registered as foodstuffs ONS in Japan.</p>
<p>The age distribution rate for prescription ONS was examined using the 2<sup>nd</sup> National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB) built by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref022">22</xref>]. Given these percentages, questionnaires were collected from the web until the number of patients consuming prescription ONS (including those who also consumed over-the-counter ONS) and those of patients consuming only over-the-counter ONS reached 150 each. The NDB consists mainly of health insurance claims, including basic patient information, such as sex and age, plus items such as the number of insurance points, the name of the illness or injury, medical practice information and drug administration and prescription information.</p>
<p>Patients who consumed prescription ONS combined with over-the-counter ONS and nasogastric tube or gastrostomy were then excluded. Ultimately, the patients who consumed prescription ONS and those who consumed over-the-counter ONS were defined as the prescription ONS group and over-the-counter ONS group, respectively.</p>

<title>Ethical approval and studies and informed consent</title>
<p>Respondents had to fill out their name in the questionnaire or had to be identifiable in order to be included in this study and prevent data duplication. Respondents&#8217; confidentiality was guaranteed, and privacy policy statements were included in the introduction section of the questionnaire. The study protocol was approved by the Kurume University Ethics Committee (No. 18098).</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The questionnaire was started when respondents answered "Yes" to the two following questions: &#8220;Have you (or a person in your care) visited a hospital for some illness within the past year?&#8221; and &#8220;Do you (or a person in your care) currently consume ONS as a hospital outpatient?&#8221; The questionnaire then inquired as to whether the respondent was a patient themselves or a caregiver. If the respondent was a caregiver, it asked what their relationship was with the patient. Finally, the survey instrument contained questions about a variety of patient demographic characteristics, such as the age, gender, body mass index (BMI), region, employment and household income (JPY per month). The second part consisted of 18 questions regarding the management and adherence to taking ONS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222972.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>If respondents answered "Yes" to Q5 &#8220;Were you given advice by doctors or registered dietitians?&#8221;, the respondents went on to answer Q6-Q8: &#8220;How often were you advised to take ONS? (e.g. daily, once a week, etc.)&#8221;, &#8220;How many calories of ONS were you advised to consume daily?&#8221; and &#8220;How long were you advised to take ONS?&#8221;</p>
<p>If respondents did not answer &#8220;Not determined&#8221; or &#8220;Unknown&#8221; for Q6-Q8, the respondents were then asked Q12 &#8220;Do you follow the medical advice (number of times, amount, duration)?&#8221; Q12 was then analyzed for each of the different dimensions related to following advice concerning the number of times, amount and duration using a Likert-type 4-point scale: not at all well, slightly well, well and very well. Responses to Q15 &#8220;Are you satisfied with your ONS (overall, nutrition, ease of consumption, taste, price, ease of prescription/purchase)?&#8221; were analyzed for each of the different dimensions related to satisfaction regarding overall satisfaction, nutrition, ease of drinking, taste, price, ease of obtaining using a Likert-type 7-point scale: very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, slightly dissatisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, slightly satisfied, satisfied, very satisfied and unknown.</p>
<p>Comparison analyses of the surveys were performed between the prescription and over-the-counter ONS groups. Responses to Q9 and Q11 were also compared between the two groups among patients who were given advice by doctors or registered dietitians. Response to Q10 were compared between the two groups after excluding patients who did not know the amount or type of ONS they consumed.</p>

<p>A total of 14.0% of patients prescribed ONS were &#8804;50 years of age, 22.0% were 51&#8211;74 years of age, and 64.0% were &#8805;75 years of age in the NDB data. Given these percentages, patients were collected. Responses were collected from August 31 to September 18, 2018 until the number of patients consuming prescription ONS (including those who also consumed over-the-counter ONS) and those of patients consuming only over-the-counter ONS reached 150 each. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222972.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the respondents flow of this study, with 83925 potential respondents sent a questionnaire. As 82456 respondents did not consume ONS, those were excluded. Three hundred and eighty-seven of these patients had consumed ONS within the past year. Eighty-seven patients had insufficient data. Patients who consume prescription ONS and patients consuming only over-the-counter ONS reached 150 each. Of the patients who consumed prescription ONS, 43 patients who combined with over-the-counter ONS were excluded. Of the patients who consumed over-the-counter ONS, 2 patients who used a nasogastric tube were excluded. Ultimately, 107 patients who matched the inclusion criteria for the prescription ONS group and 148 who matched the criteria for the over-the-counter ONS group were further analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222972.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The prevalence of disease-related malnutrition is reportedly 20%&#8211;50% among patients admitted to hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref014">14</xref>] and 19% among hospital outpatients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref023">23</xref>]. The condition is associated with a decreased quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref025">25</xref>] and increased length of hospital stay, morbidity, mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref026">26</xref>] and cost of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Baldwin et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of nutritional intervention with dietary advice and/or oral nutritional supplements during treatment for cancer patients who were malnourished or at nutritional risk. Thirteen studies that included 1414 cancer patients were included in the analysis. Nutritional intervention resulted in statistically significant improvements in weight and energy intake, although no marked differences were observed after removing the studies responsible for heterogeneity. Some aspects of the quality of life, including emotional functioning, dyspnea, loss of appetite, and global quality of life, were improved. Nutritional intervention had no effect on mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref028">28</xref>]. Concerning advancing age, undernutrition and chronic diseases, Gariballa et al. reported a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ONS. ONS of acutely ill patients improved their nutritional status and led to a statistically significant reduction in the number of non-elective readmissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>For enhancing the food intake, dietary modification and food fortification are necessary. When these measures prove to be ineffective, the provision of ONS is indicated. Good adherence to ONS is essential to the success of nutritional therapy. Regarding factors influencing ONS adherence, a positive association has previously been shown between energy density and ONS adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref021">21</xref>]. Other influencing factors are suggested to be the duration of ONS usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref030">30</xref>], variety of supplements prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref030">30</xref>], how the supplement is taken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref020">20</xref>] and whether or not the patient has been informed of the purpose of the ONS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, in the prescription ONS group, all patients were given medical advice from doctors or registered dietitians, whereas in the prescription ONS group, only 46 patients (31.1%) were given such advice. Although all patients in the prescription ONS group received a prescription, 67.3% of patients were recommended ONS by their prescribing doctor, and 4.7% were recommended it by another doctor. This seems to suggest that some patients were recommended a prescription ONS by the nutrition support team and others by a multidisciplinary team. Intensive patient education by a nutrition support team to increase the number of feeding opportunities in order to cover the small amount tolerated per occasion as well as for patients to adhere to an adequate ONS program will help reduce body weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to achieve compliance, ONS comes in a variety of flavors and textures and can be served at different temperatures, according to patients' tastes, at times they prefer. Furthermore, energy-dense supplements seem to be more easily accepted and effective, as they minimize the volume that must be consumed in order to achieve the desired results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref032">32</xref>]. Hubbard et al. reported in their systematic review of adherence to ONS that compliance across a heterogeneous group of unmatched studies was positively associated with a greater ONS energy density and total energy intakes, negatively associated with age and unrelated to the amount or duration of ONS prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Reducing the volume of ONS during medication rounds increased the compliance of patients needing ONS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref033">33</xref>]. In the present study, over 80% of over-the-counter ONS were Maibalance<sup>&#174;</sup>. This formulation is based on the Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese (2015), comes in several flavors, and can be ingested in small amounts with high calorie counts (200 kcal/125 ml). It is easy to purchase over the counter in supermarkets or pharmacies as well as online. Patients in the over-the-counter ONS group reported significantly higher satisfaction with the ONS ease of consumption and taste than those in the prescription ONS group. However, the number of ONS calories consumed in a day was significantly higher in the prescription ONS group than in the over-the-counter ONS group. It is not possible to consume a sufficient amount of the over-the-counter ONS by taking in patients&#8217; own determined, which might be related to the significant difference in the BMI between the two groups.</p>
<p>There has been increasing interest in the effects of ONS on healthcare use and costs. In the acute setting, reductions in the length of hospital stay and complications and a reduction in associated costs have been well documented with ONS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref001">1</xref>]. Furthermore, regarding the total healthcare cost and quality of life among patients, ONS use significantly reduces the rate of hospital readmission, especially in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref034">34</xref>]. In the present study, while there was no significant difference between the two groups, the cost in the over-the-counter ONS group was higher than in the prescription ONS group. In Japan, through the national health insurance scheme, patients under 70 years old only have to pay a 30% medical copayment, while those 70&#8211;74 years old must pay 20%, and those &#8805;75 years old must pay 10% (those with income comparable to the current workforce have a copayment of 30%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref035">35</xref>]. If the adherence and calories intake of the two groups were similar, over-the-counter ONS would be much higher than prescription ONS.</p>
<p>In this study, there was a significant difference in the regional spread between the two groups. This may be because doctors and registered dietitians in some regions might recommend one ONS over another, or patients&#8217; purchase intentions in certain regions might be higher than in others.</p>
<p>The present study is associated with some limitations due to its wide age distribution and varied health conditions among respondents and small sample size. As this study used an online cross-sectional survey, it was limited to subjects who had internet access. Patients freely consumed both the ONS and ordinary food. Although the data on the ONS intake were accumulated with the utmost care, data on the actual dietary caloric intake were not collected. This study did not categorize ONS into subtypes, such as oligomeric, disease-specific and macronutrient ONS. It might therefore have included patients who did not require ONS treatment, especially the over-the-counter ONS group. It seems also crucial to ensure that patients are offered flavors, textures and/or scents that they like, as these can influence their compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref036">36</xref>]. Our study did not assess the protein, mineral or vitamin content. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, high-protein supplements were shown to produce clinical benefits, with subsequent economic implications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222972.ref023">23</xref>]. Furthermore, not only calories but also protein content can significantly influence results.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Adherence can be improved by encouraging patients and explaining the reasoning and aims of nutritional support. Overall, a greater support by the medical team is still needed in order to maximize adherence to supplementation, especially concerning the calories, timing and period, so that benefits can be achieved and sustained. Consequently, more studies are needed in order to understand the effects of ONSs.</p>

<p>PLOS ONE</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Naoki Hashizume,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#8217;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p>ACADEMIC EDITOR: The reviewers have raised a number of points which we believe major modifications are necessary to improve the manuscript, taking into account the reviewers' remarks.&#160; Please consider and address each of the comments raised by the reviewers before resubmitting the manuscript. This letter should not be construed as implying acceptance, as a revised version will be subject to re-review.</p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Sep 14 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
<p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p>
<p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ns0:type="simple">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
<p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
<p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>The survey duration is too short and patients number is small.</p>
<p>Reviewer #4: Several studies have found health benefits associated with consumption of oral nutritional supplements (ONS). Hence, their consumption is often recommended, especially in the case of disease-related malnutrition. Hashizume et al. note that the health benefits from ONS consumption vary between patient groups with one of the explanatory factors being the extent to which patients adhere to ONS. Previous studies have found that higher adherence is associated with increase in body weight. With the motivation to find the right strategy to guide patient behavior towards ONS consumption, Hashizume et al. conducted an online survey in Japan. They examined whether the adherence of patients varies according to the kind of ONS that they are consuming &#8212; &#8220;prescribed&#8221; or &#8220;purchased&#8221;. The &#8220;prescribed&#8221; ONS are available with prescription only and the &#8220;purchased&#8221; ONS can be bought over-the-counter. The authors collected data from individuals of different ages, both genders, different BMIs, from different regions of Japan, different occupations and different income levels. They noted that the samples for the two categories of ONS were significantly different in terms of the regional composition of individuals and their BMIs. Although &gt;80,000 individuals started the online questionnaire, the survey effectively included 107 individuals for &#8220;prescribed&#8221; ONS and 148 for &#8220;purchased&#8221; ONS. They report their observations on several factors that might distinguish the adherence of those consuming &#8220;prescribed&#8221; vs &#8220;purchased&#8221; ONS, e.g., patient characteristics, medical reasons for taking ONS, cost of taking ONS, type of ONS, having received medical advice, number of times and duration over which to take ONS, etc. They also asked the respondents why the patients did not adhere to the medical advice, if they were satisfied with the ONS that they were receiving or if they knew of the alternatives. Based on the responses, the authors conclude that encouraging patients and explaining the reasoning and aims of nutritional support can improve patient adherence. The authors describe the motivation for the survey, its design, the characteristics of data, data analysis methodology, limitations of the survey and provide helpful recommendations to medical teams on how to encourage patient adherence. Overall, the manuscript delivers what it promises in the abstract and the introduction. I have the following questions/suggestions, which I hope the authors will consider:</p>
<p>1. From what I could understand, what the authors call the &#8220;prescribed&#8221; ONS is also purchased by the patients. Similarly, what they call the &#8220;purchased&#8221; ONS may also be prescribed/recommended by nutritional experts. I found the terminology confusing. Since the difference between the two categories is that one is available with prescription only while the other is available over-the-counter, I recommend calling the &#8220;prescribed&#8221; and &#8220;purchased&#8221; ONS as &#8220;prescription&#8221; and &#8220;over-the-counter&#8221; ONS, respectively.</p>
<p>2. On the first page of the abstract, second to the last line, it starts as, &#8220;In contrast, in the prescribed ONS group, only 46 patients &#8230;&#8221;. Did the authors mean purchased ONS group instead?</p>
<p>3. The large majority of individuals who started the questionnaire did not complete it. Is there any systematic reason why this was the case?</p>
<p>4. All the figure legends are repetitions of text also in the main text. I suggest that the figure legends be replaced with a brief title.</p>
<p>Reviewer #5: 1. How did you select participants to invitation to survey</p>
<p>2. Did you have any incentive to complete the survey</p>
<p>3. The main limitation of this study is the low response rate to survey. Therefore, the result cannot represent the nationwide data in Japan</p>

<p>Dear reviewers</p>
<p>Thank you for your some comments.We wish to express our appreciation to the reviewers for their insightful comments on our paper. The comments have helped us significantly improve the paper. </p>
<p>Dear reviewer #1</p>
<p>Q1; Clearly state the objective of the study in the introduction section. </p>
<p>Add importance of oral nutritional supplements in the introduction section.</p>
<p>A1; We added the section in introduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aims of this study were the examination of difference between outpatients used prescription ONS and those used over-the-counter ONS and adherence to prescription ONS prescribed by a doctor and to over-the-counter ONS purchased by themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A variety of benefits have been found for ONS use, including reduced length of stay, inpatient episode cost, complication rates, depressive symptoms, readmission rates, and improved lean body mass recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q2; Table 3 is too long. If possible, divide into two or more parts.</p>
<p>A2; Table3 was divided two parts (Table 3 and Table 4)</p>
<p>Q3; Table 4 is too long. If possible, divide into two or more parts.</p>
<p>A3; Table4 was divided two parts (Table 5 and Table 6)</p>
<p>Q4; More statistical parameters are applied for the authentication of data.</p>
<p>A4; The statistical analysis for 2 groups was used statistically general method according to the question format.</p>
<p>Q5; The references are arranged according to the guidelines of journal.</p>
<p>A5; Absolutely, we check the guidelines of journal.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: </p>
<p>Q1; The study design section has some results which can be move to the results section.</p>
<p>A1; We moved to the result about the percentage of patients in NDB and survey duration.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: </p>
<p>Q1; The manuscript should be revised for linguistic errors.</p>
<p>A1; This paper was revised by licensed English native speaker.</p>
<p>Q2; The oral nutritional supplementation should be specified within the manuscript.</p>
<p>A2; We added the sentence in method.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prescription ONS were registered in Japan as follows; Elental&#174; (EA Pharma Co., Ltd , Japan), Elental P&#174; (EA Pharma Co., Ltd , Japan), Ensure Liquid&#174; (Abbott Japan Co., Ltd., Japan), Ensure H&#174; (Abbott Japan Co., Ltd.), Enevo&#174; (Abbott Japan Co., Ltd.), Twinline-NF&#174; (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan), Racol-NF&#174; (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan). Over-the-counter ONS are registered as foodstuffs ONS in Japan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q3; The survey duration is too short and patients number is small.</p>
<p>A3; The number of samples that could be sufficiently quantitatively analyzed was 300 or more in this study. The duration was the period required to have the answer.</p>
<p>Reviewer #4: SI have the following questions/suggestions, which I hope the authors will consider:</p>
<p>Q1; From what I could understand, what the authors call the &#8220;prescribed&#8221; ONS is also purchased by the patients. Similarly, what they call the &#8220;purchased&#8221; ONS may also be prescribed/recommended by nutritional experts. I found the terminology confusing. Since the difference between the two categories is that one is available with prescription only while the other is available over-the-counter, I recommend calling the &#8220;prescribed&#8221; and &#8220;purchased&#8221; ONS as &#8220;prescription&#8221; and &#8220;over-the-counter&#8221; ONS, respectively.</p>
<p>A1; I edited prescribed to prescription, and purchased to over-the-counter</p>
<p>Q2; On the first page of the abstract, second to the last line, it starts as, &#8220;In contrast, in the prescribed ONS group, only 46 patients &#8230;&#8221;. Did the authors mean purchased ONS group instead?</p>
<p>A2; Absolutely, I edited.</p>
<p>Q3; The large majority of individuals who started the questionnaire did not complete it. Is there any systematic reason why this was the case?</p>
<p>A3; Firstly, we collect the patients who visited a hospital for some illness within the past year and currently consume ONS as a hospital outpatient. For collecting 300 patients, we need to start the questionnaire to the large majority of individuals.</p>
<p>Q4. All the figure legends are repetitions of text also in the main text. I suggest that the figure legends be replaced with a brief title.</p>
<p>A4; I edited to a brief title.</p>
<p>Reviewer #5: </p>
<p>Q1; How did you select participants to invitation to survey?</p>
<p>A1; I edited about the description of selected participants</p>
<p>&#8220;The survey was hosted by the market research company EPOCA Marketing Co., Ltd., which recruited samples from 2.2 million people registered with the company intended to be representative of the Japan population.&#8221; </p>
<p>Q2; Did you have any incentive to complete the survey</p>
<p>A2; The aims of this study were the examination of difference between outpatients used prescription ONS and those used over-the-counter ONS and adherence to prescription ONS prescribed by a doctor and to over-the-counter ONS purchased by themselves.</p>
<p>Q3; The main limitation of this study is the low response rate to survey. Therefore, the result cannot represent the nationwide data in Japan</p>
<p>A3; We excluded &#8220;nationwide survey&#8221;</p>
