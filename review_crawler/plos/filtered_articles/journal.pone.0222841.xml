<abstract>
<p>Composting is an important treatment method for <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> shell and goat dung, which is crucial for the development of tea oil industry and goat breeding industry. Ventilation is the important regulatory factor in composting process, and high degree of maturity is the principal requirement for safe application of composting product. In the study, four treatments were designed as every 5 days turning (A1), every 7 days turning (A2), every 10 days turning(A3), and every 15 days turning (A4) for evaluating the maturity of <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> shell co-composted with goat dung and optimizing turning frequency.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic>) is one of the important tree species in China's non-wood product forests. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic>, oil palm (<italic>Elaeis guineensis</italic> Jacq.), olive (<italic>Olea europaea</italic> L.), and coconut (<italic>Cocos nucifera</italic> L.) are the four major tree species in the world that produce woody edible oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref001">1</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell is an important byproduct from the processing of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic>, whose raw weight is approximately 1.5 times that of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref002">2</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell is rich in lignocellulose, saponins and tannins which were not conducive to microbial degradation and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref004">4</xref>]. In addition, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell is rich in polysaccharides, proteins, fats, and other organic matter, as well as many trace elements and biologically active substances essential for plant growth, which make it a valuable biomass resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref005">5</xref>]. The output of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> seed reached more than 2.3 million tons by 2018, more than twice that of 2008, and a large number of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell was also produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref007">7</xref>]. Most of the shell is directly discarded for natural decomposition or burned as fuel. Waste gas, liquid, and residue produced in the treatment process pose potential threats to environmental safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Composting is an effective means of processing <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell and other solid organic waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref009">9</xref>]. However, given the physical and chemical properties of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell, particularly due to the presence of woody fibers, it is not suitable for self-composting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref010">10</xref>]. Co-composting refers to the composting of raw materials together with other waste, such as dairy manure with straw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref011">11</xref>], and chicken manure with sawdust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref012">12</xref>]. Adding appropriate waste materials for co-composting can accelerate organic matter decomposition, shorten composting time, and enhance compost quality. Similar to pig and chicken manure, goat dung has high level of C, N, P, K and provides additional microorganisms for improved composting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref014">14</xref>]. To accelerate the composting process of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell and improve compost quality, goat dung can be added for co-composting.</p>
<p>Through composting, organic chemicals in the shell are transformed by microbes into a stable, usable, and high value-added compost product, which helps prevent environmental pollution. Such products not only provide nutrients for plant growth but also improve soil properties, such as nutrients increase in soil and physical properties improvement of soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref015">15</xref>]. Furthermore, most of the harmful organisms (including pests, weed seeds, viruses and pathogens et al.) are killed during composting, which reduces the incidence of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Ventilation is an important controlling factor in the composting process. Appropriate ventilation can control the temperature of the compost pile, remove excess water and carbon dioxide, provide oxygen for microbial activity, and influence the physical and chemical properties of the final compost product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref017">17</xref>]. Turning is a common method of altering the ventilation. High turning frequency will adversely decrease the temperature of the compost pile will, and will increase the composting time. Low turning frequency could result in anaerobic fermentation in the compost pile and production of ozone and other harmful substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref018">18</xref>]. Hence, an appropriate turning frequency is an important factor for enhancing the composting efficiency.</p>
<p>Maturity is an important criterion for evaluating the safety and stability of compost product. When microbial activity and plant toxin concentrations decrease to a safe level and compost no longer undergoes apparent material changes, the compost is considered to be 'mature'. One of the aims of choosing the appropriate turning frequency is to get the compost to be 'mature' quickly. Compost product not meeting maturity standards can easily cause environmental pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref016">16</xref>]. However, due to the diversity and heterogeneity of raw materials, substantial variability exists in our understanding of the indices used to evaluate compost product maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref019">19</xref>]. Bernal et al. (2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref010">10</xref>] and Nolan et al. (2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref020">20</xref>] noted that compost maturity could not be well described by any single attribute or parameter. Many studies used various physical, chemical (e.g., pH, temperature, and total organic carbon), and biological parameters [e.g., germination index (GI), seedling growth quality] to determine compost maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref021">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref023">23</xref>]. In order to better judge the effect of turning frequency on compost maturity, it is very important to select appropriate parameters that can reflect the change of maturity.</p>
<p>In this study, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell and goat dung were used as the raw materials of compost. The temperature, pH, different nitrogen forms, GI and other parameters of the compost pile during composting were analyzed. Standard maturity indices suitable for the co-compost of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell with goat dung were determined. The turning frequency of compost was also optimized to provide a theoretical basis for the composting of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell.</p>

<title>Descriptions of the study area</title>
<p>The composting experiment was performed during a 76-day period from October to December 2012. The study area was located in the Research Institute of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry in Fuyang District, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China. Its altitude is 26.1 m, and its coordinates are approximately N 30&#176;3&#8217;31&#8221;, E 119&#176;57&#8217;11&#8221; (latitude/longitude). During the study, the highest and lowest temperatures of that area were 24&#176;C and 3&#176;C, respectively, and the highest and lowest air humidity measurements were 84% and 32%, respectively.</p>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell used in the experiment was obtained from the East Red Forest Farm in Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province. Goat dung was obtained from a farm in Jilong Mountain, Fuyang District, Hangzhou city, Zhejiang Province. The effective microorganisms (EM) microbial agent was purchased from Henan Nanhua Qianmu Biotechnology Co., Ltd., and its main ingredients were <italic>Bacillus</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, yeast, photosynthetic bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, <italic>Actinobacillus</italic>, and other original species.</p>

<title>Experimental set-up</title>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell was crushed, passed through an 8-mm sieve, and co-composted with fresh goat dung. The dry mass ratio of the shell and goat dung was 4:1 in all experimental treatments. The EM microbial agent (weighing 3% of the dry mass of shell and goat dung) and urea were added to adjust the initial carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N) to 30, and the initial moisture content to 55%. No adjustments of these parameters were made thereafter. In this experiment, box composting was used, which took place in an insulated and well-ventilated eco-composter (outer dimensions: 73 cm &#215; 115 cm &#215; 80 cm; volume: 220 L; manufacturer: Biolan). During the experiment, the cover of the composter was closed, and the ventilation valve was rotated to the maximum ventilation level.

<title>Temperature</title>
<p>Temperature is an important indicator for monitoring the composting process. The optimum temperature range for composting is 40&#8211;65&#176;C, and temperature exceeding 55&#176;C is a necessary condition for killing pathogenic microbes, insect eggs, and weed seeds and for ensuring the compost product is harmless (Bernal et al., 2009). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222841.g001">Fig 1</xref>, temperature in all treatments rapidly increased after the start of composting. A2 entered the thermophilic phase (&gt;50&#176;C) on 9<sup>th</sup> day, and A1, A3, and A4 entered the phase on the 12<sup>th</sup>, 32<sup>nd</sup>, and 11<sup>th</sup> day, respectively. The maximum temperatures of A1, A2, A3, and A4 were 72.7&#176;C, 71.8&#176;C, 62.7&#176;C, and 68.67&#176;C, respectively, which occurred on the 25th, 13th, 34th, and 19th day of the composting period, respectively. In all treatments, the thermophilic phase lasted for more than 4 consecutive weeks, particularly in A2, where it lasted for 41 consecutive days, and all treatments met hygiene and safety standards (temperature above 55&#176;C for more than 3 consecutive days) (GB 7959&#8211;2012, China). After approximately 50 days of composting, the thermophilic phase ended, and the temperature of the compost pile decreased gradually. Between 50 and 60 days after composting, due to reduced temperature and the accumulation of soluble organic matter, microbial activity increased again [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref010">10</xref>], leading to another stage of temperature rise in the compost pile, and after 60 days of composting, the temperature in all treatments rapidly decreased to ambient temperature. This may be due to a lot of heat lost by turning over the heap, far more than the heat generated by the material metabolism of microorganisms. In terms of temperature variability, A2 had a faster rate of temperature increase and the longest thermophilic phase.</p>

<title>pH</title>
<p>The pH is one of the important factors affecting the growth and reproduction of microbes. Microbial activity can be inhibited at too high or too low of pH, which hinders composting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref018">18</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222841.g002">Fig 2</xref>, the initial pH in A1, A2, A3, and A4 was 6.29&#177;0.11, 6.32&#177;01, 6.27&#177;0.04, and 6.24&#177;0.07, respectively. The optimum pH for composting is 5.5&#8211;8.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref027">27</xref>]. During the first 20 days of composting, the pH in all treatments increased rapidly. On the 20th day of the composting period, the pH in A1, A2, A3, and A4 was 8.06&#177;0.09, 8.07&#177;0.08, 8.12&#177;0.03, and 7.84&#177;0.03, respectively. This pH might be due to the breakdown of phenolic acid compounds in the raw materials, as well as the breakdown of proteins and amino acids by microbes that produce ammonia and other alkaline substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref011">11</xref>]. The pH of the compost pile decreased afterwards, which might be caused by the formation of organic acids and phenolic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref029">29</xref>]. At the end of composting, the pH of the composted product in A1, A2, A3, and A4 was 7.08&#177;0.03, 7.21&#177;0.02, 7.47&#177;0.10, and 6.91&#177;0.02, respectively, which are all in the suitable range of seedling growth (Bustamante et al. 2008).</p>

<title>Total nitrogen</title>
<p>Nitrogen is the main elemental nutrient in the compost product. Improper composting procedures can result in a substantial loss of nitrogen. Not only does the compost product lacking nitrogen have low fertilizer efficiency, it may take up soil nitrogen, thereby resulting in a soil nutrient imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref017">17</xref>]. During the 76-day composting, the TN content in all treatments increased variably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222841.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and was significantly positively correlated with the number of days of composting (r = 0.952, P&lt;0.05; r = 0.900, P&lt;0.05; r = 0.976, P&lt;0.01; r = 0.965, P&lt;0.001). The TN content in A1, A2, A3, and A4 increased by 88.9%, 99.8%, 83.9%, and 103.4%, respectively. This might be caused by the mineralization of organic matter during composting, loss of CO<sub>2</sub>, and evaporative loss of water driven by heat production during the oxidation of organic matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref030">30</xref>].</p>

N, P, and K are all essential elemental nutrients for plant growth, and total nutrient content (%) greater than 5% is an important indicator of a compost product that is being considered an organic fertilizer [Chinese standard for organic fertilizers (NY525-2012)]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222841.g006">Fig 6</xref>, during composting, the total nutrient content in all treatments was significantly positively correlated with the number of days of composting (r = 0.974, r = 0.972, r = 0.976, r = 0.995, P&lt;0.01, respectively). The total nutrient contents of A2, A3, and A4 were greater than 5% on the 60th day, and that in A1 was greater than 5% on the 76th day. When the composting ended (76th day), the total nutrient content in A1, A2, A3, and A4 was 5.41&#177;0.14%, 5.75&#177;0.11%, 5.62&#177;0.12%, and 5.53&#177;0.06%, respectively. Among these treatments, the total nutrient content was the highest in A2, indicating that too high or too low of turning frequency could cause the loss of total nutrients. In this experiment, the total nutrient content in the compost product was the highest when the turning frequency was once every 7 days.</p>

<title>Germination index (GI)</title>
<p>The GI can effectively reflect the phytotoxicity of the compost. The compost is considered basically nontoxic when the GI is greater than 60%, and the phytotoxicity of the compost completely disappears when the GI is greater than 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref031">31</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222841.g007">Fig 7</xref>, the GI of Bok choy (<italic>Brassica chinensis</italic> L.) in the compost pile exhibited an increasing trend in the different treatments and in the different composting stages. In particular, GI in the compost pile in A1 and A3 decreased considerably after 14&#8211;20 days of composting. This might be related to the phytotoxicity of small molecules in the compost, such as ammonia, phenols, and acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref018">18</xref>]. At the end of composting, the GI in A1, A2, A3, and A4 was 110.12%, 103.00%, 73.94%, and 108.41%, respectively. GI in A1, A2, and A4 was 48.93%, 39.30%, and 46.62% higher than that in A3, respectively. This result indicated that the final compost in A1, A2, and A4 did not have phytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref019">19</xref>], and the final compost in A3 was still toxic to plants. Therefore, turning could accelerate the breakdown and conversion of phytotoxic substances in the compost pile and facilitate the maturation of compost. when the turning frequency is low enough, sufficient anaerobic fermentation can also reduce the phytotoxicity of the compost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref036">36</xref>]. However, GI was measured by using leachate from compost, which cannot explain the harmful effects of many insoluble substances in compost products on plant growth, nor can explain the effects on plant root growth and aboveground development. Therefore, GI alone cannot prove that compost products are maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref037">37</xref>].</p>

<title>Solvita maturity index</title>
<p>Solvita maturity index is a widely accepted index obtained through simple tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref038">38</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222841.t002">Table 2</xref>, after the start of composting, The Solvita maturity index increased gradually in all treatments. At the end of composting, the Solvita maturity index in A1, A2, A3, and A4 was 7, 7, 5, and 7 respectively. When the Solvita maturity index is 7, composting is considered &#8220;finished,&#8221; according to the &#8220;Guide to Solvita testing for compost maturity index&#8221; (Woods End Research, 2002).

<title>Evaluation system of maturity indices</title>
<p>Many parameters have been used as indicators for evaluating compost maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0222841.ref022">22</xref>]. In this study, the Solvita maturity index was used as a standard index, and its correlations with parameters such as TN, C/N, and GI were analyzed. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0222841.t003">Table 3</xref>, both TN, C/N, and GI in four treatments were significantly correlated with the Solvita maturity index (P&lt;0.05). The C/N was negatively correlated with other maturity parameters (TN, GI, and Solvita maturity index). The TN, GI, and Solvita maturity index were positively correlated with each other. During composting, the TN, GI, and Solvita maturity index showed an increasing trend, and the C/N showed a decreasing trend. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify factors that could distinguish the relationships between physicochemical parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222841.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The parameters were grouped according to principal components in four clearly distinguished clusters.

According to the correlation analysis, TN, C/N ratio and GI can be used to evaluate the maturity of compost of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>oleifera</italic> shell and goat dung comprehensively. Among the four treatments, the longest duration of thermophilic phase was observed in A2 for 42 days (&gt;50&#176;C), with the highest total nutrient (5.75&#177;0.11%) and lowest C/N value (15.83&#177;1.10). It can be seen that the turning frequency of every 7 days can improve the quality of compost products. However, due to the diversity of raw materials and composting conditions, we need to do more research to acquire parameters with simple determination method and strong correlation with maturity to determine the appropriate turning frequency for composting.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Please re-write the conclusion. Based on the purpose and the actual data.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: This study conducted a 76-day composting experiment to explore the effects of turning frequency on the nutrients of Camellia oleifera shell co-compost with sheep manure and evaluation of co-compost maturity. The results showed that turning once every 7 days is the most suitable way to enhance the composting efficiency and compost product quality. In addition, this study proposed that TN, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N), and GI are useful indexes for comprehensively evaluate the compost maturity. In general, this work has some significance for practical production. However, further analysis and discussion about the relationships among these indexes are needed in this manuscript using a better statistical analysis method. Moreover, there some small problems needed to be revised. Thus, I think the present paper need a revision before publication. I hope my comments would be of help to the future improvement of the work.</p>
<p>1. Lines 284-294: Composting is a complex environmental process, many parameters will affect each other. Thus, I think Pearson correlation analysis is not sufficient to determine which factors are suitable for evaluating compost maturity. Multivariate analysis may be helpful to further understand the complex relationships among various parameters of composts. Redundancy analysis (RDA), structural equation models (SEMs) et al. may be a good choice, and the following references may helpful: Bioresource Technology 285 (2019) 121326; Environmental Pollution 250 (2019) 166-174.</p>
<p>2. The discussion section needs to be improved, and appropriate outlook should be supplemented.</p>
<p>3. Are &#8220;sheep manure&#8221; and &#8220;goat dung&#8221; the same in meaning? If they are same, please unify the words.</p>
<p>4. The method of moisture determination should be introduced in the &#8220;materials and methods&#8221; section.</p>
<p>5. Lines 145-146: why the temperature decreased to room temperature suddenly in all treatments?</p>
<p>6. The resolution of the pictures in the manuscript is poor.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: </p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Why it is so important to undertake these trials&#65311;What&#8217;s the purpose?</p>
<p>Why shell? Why manure? Why combined?</p>
<p>Line 12, &#8220;could enhance&#8221; compare with what?</p>
<p>Sample conclusion is missing.</p>
<p>The purpose and background of the experiment are supplemented in the abstract, but the reasons for the use of co-composting are explained in detail in the introduction. "Can enhance" is a comparison between different groups under different heap turnover frequencies.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Lines 26-28, please rephrase these sentences.</p>
<p>Modified to " C. oleifera shell is rich in lignocellulose, saponins and tannins which were not conducive to microbial degradation and metabolism ".</p>
<p>Line 27, &#8220;slowly&#8221;, how long?</p>
<p>The standard of natural decay of C. oleifera shell shell is generally more than 6 months. Because there is no specific data, it is revised in this paper.</p>
<p>Lines 28-30, reference(s)?</p>
<p>Relevant references have been supplemented in this paper.</p>
<p>Line 31, amount of the production? Add reference(s).</p>
<p>It has been supplemented in the paper according to the references.</p>
<p>Lines 42-45, reference(s)? Why sheep manure?</p>
<p>Co-composting of livestock manure and other materials to make the composting process go smoothly is a common waste composting method, which has been used in many literatures. Similar to pig manure and chicken manure, sheep manure has a high content of CNPK, and can provide additional microorganisms for improving composting. It is also one of the common wastes around the experimental area. Therefore, sheep manure and Camellia shell are selected for co-composting.</p>
<p>Line 46, &#8220;improve&#8221;, how?</p>
<p>It has been supplemented in the article, &#8220;such as nutrients increase in soil and physical properties improvement of soil&#8221;.</p>
<p>Line 47, &#8220;pests&#8221;, for examples. Pests, including viruses and pathogens? What&#8217;s the meaning?</p>
<p>The pest means Harmful organisms, But there are misunderstandings in this paper. So we revised the expression in this paper. &#8220;Furthermore, most of the harmful organisms (including pests, weed seeds, viruses and pathogens et al.) are killed during composting, which reduces the incidence of diseases&#8221;</p>
<p>Lines 53-56,&#8221;high&#8221; and &#8220;low&#8221; are generic terms. Please indicate a quantity.</p>
<p>"High" and "low" are the relative values of overturning frequency, which can not give specific values. In the article, "high" refers to turning frequency of 5 days, while "low" refers to turning frequency of 15 days.</p>
<p>Lines 59-70, this subsection needs to be rewritten. What&#8217;s the key point for this paragraph?</p>
<p>This section is to illustrate the importance of compost maturity, because the compost product reaches maturity, so that the product can be used in production premise. Choosing the turning frequency is also to make the compost material ripen as quickly as possible. It also provides a reference for judging the availability of compost products and adjusting the turning frequency in practical operation.</p>
<p>Lines 72-73, the purpose for testing these parameters.</p>
<p>The purpose of testing these parameters is to find a simple and low-cost way to judge the maturity of compost products and to determine which turning frequency is more suitable for composting. Although Solvita index is internationally recognized as an effective index for judging maturity, its domestic price is still on the high side.</p>
<p>Line 94, water content of the shell.</p>
<p>This step is to control the size of Camellia shell. I think the moisture content of Camellia shell has nothing to do with this operation. The moisture content of Camellia shell will change during storage, so the moisture content of raw materials is not important and will not be explained. And in the follow-up operation, we use dry matter as the adjustment standard, the moisture content of raw materials in this step has no effect on the follow-up.</p>
<p>Line 95, 55% is water content or relative humidity?</p>
<p>55% is water content, and moisture content is also used in other composting literature. (Wang, Y. Q., Zhang, J. L., Schuchardt, F., &amp; Wang, Y. (2014). Degradation of morphine in opium poppy processing waste composting. Bioresource Technology, 168(3), 235-239.)</p>
<p>Lines 113-115, depth of the pile.</p>
<p>It has been supplemented in this article. depth of the pile was 1.2m </p>
<p>Lines 124-125, more details.</p>
<p>In this paper, the analysis method and the information of using software are supplemented&#65288; Canoco 5.0 and PCA&#65289;.</p>
<p>Results and discussion</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to add statistical analysis of the difference between different treatments.</p>
<p>PCA analysis is supplemented to judge that the selected parameters are reasonable and representative.</p>
<p>Lines 133-135, please rephrase these sentences.</p>
<p>These sentences have been amended to read "A2 enter the thermophilic phase (&gt; 50 C) on 9th day, and A1, A3, and A4 enter the phase on the 12th, 32nd, and 11th day, respectively."</p>
<p>Line 140, (GB 7959-87), China?</p>
<p>Yes, this is China's national standard, which has been replaced. The standard is now changed to GB 7959-2012. China.</p>
<p>Lines 175-176, 211, 241-242, r and P, in italics.</p>
<p>I consulted the literature of many magazines and found no need to change it into italics. Therefore, there is no modification in the paper.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Please re-write the conclusion. Based on the purpose and the actual data.</p>
<p>The conclusion has been revised.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the study, the products obtained from composting of C. oleifera shell and goat dung for 76 days were in accordance with the Chinese organic fertilizer standard NY525-2012. In the composting process, TN, NO- 3-N, GI, Solvita maturity index increased with the composting process, while NH+ 4-N, C/N showed the opposite trend. According to the correlation analysis, TN, C/N ratio and GI can be used to evaluate the maturity of compost of C. oleifera shell and goat dung comprehensively. Among the four treatments, the longest duration of thermophilic phase was observed in A2 for 42 days (&gt;50&#8451;), with the highest total nutrient (5.75&#177;0.11%) and lowest C/N value (15.83&#177;1.10). It can be seen that the turning frequency of every 7 days can improve the quality of compost products. However, due to the diversity of raw materials and composting conditions, we need to do more research to acquire parameters with simple determination method and strong correlation with maturity to determine the appropriate turning frequency for composting.&#8220;</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: </p>
<p>1. Lines 284-294: Composting is a complex environmental process, many parameters will affect each other. Thus, I think Pearson correlation analysis is not sufficient to determine which factors are suitable for evaluating compost maturity. Multivariate analysis may be helpful to further understand the complex relationships among various parameters of composts. Redundancy analysis (RDA), structural equation models (SEMs) et al. may be a good choice, and the following references may helpful: Bioresource Technology 285 (2019) 121326; Environmental Pollution 250 (2019) 166-174.</p>
<p>PCA analysis is supplemented to judge that the selected parameters are reasonable and representative.</p>
<p>2. The discussion section needs to be improved, and appropriate outlook should be supplemented.</p>
<p>The conclusion has been revised.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the study, the products obtained from composting of C. oleifera shell and goat dung for 76 days were in accordance with the Chinese organic fertilizer standard NY525-2012. In the composting process, TN, NO- 3-N, GI, Solvita maturity index increased with the composting process, while NH+ 4-N, C/N showed the opposite trend. According to the correlation analysis, TN, C/N ratio and GI can be used to evaluate the maturity of compost of C. oleifera shell and goat dung comprehensively.

It can be seen that the turning frequency of every 7 days can improve the quality of compost products. However, due to the diversity of raw materials and composting conditions, we need to do more research to acquire parameters with simple determination method and strong correlation with maturity to determine the appropriate turning frequency for composting.&#8220;</p>
<p>3. Are &#8220;sheep manure&#8221; and &#8220;goat dung&#8221; the same in meaning? If they are same, please unify the words.</p>
<p>The meaning we want to express is the same, but there are problems with the use of words. It has been revised in the article and unified as "goat dung".</p>
<p>4. The method of moisture determination should be introduced in the &#8220;materials and methods&#8221; section.</p>
<p>The method for determining moisture content is supplemented in this paper. &#8220;Moisture content was obtained by drying at 105&#8451; for 24h in a hot-air oven.&#8221;</p>
<p>5. Lines 145-146: why the temperature decreased to room temperature suddenly in all treatments?</p>
<p>It may be that heap dump causes a lot of heat loss, and the heat generated by microbial metabolism after a long time of heap dump is far from enough to replenish the lost heat, so the temperature suddenly drops to room temperature. Relevant expressions are supplemented in the article.</p>
<p>6. The resolution of the pictures in the manuscript is poor. </p>
<p>Pictures have been replaced. The new picture was in 600 dpi.</p>
