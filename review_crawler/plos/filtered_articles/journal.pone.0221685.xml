<abstract>
<p>Electric fields can be a powerful tool to interact with enzymes or proteins, with an intriguing perspective to allow protein manipulation. Recently, researchers have focused the interest on intracellular enzyme modifications triggered by the application of nanosecond pulsed electric fields. These findings were also supported by theoretical predictions from molecular dynamics simulations focussing on significant variations in protein secondary structures. In this work, a theoretical study utilizing molecular dynamics simulations is proposed to explore effects of electric fields of high intensity and very short nanosecond duration applied to the superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD or SOD-1), an important enzyme involved in the cellular antioxidant defence mechanism. The effects of 100-nanosecond pulsed electric fields, with intensities ranging from 10<sup>8</sup> to 7x10<sup>8</sup> V/m, on a single SOD1 enzyme are presented. We demonstrated that the lowest intensity of 10<sup>8</sup> V/m, although not inducing structural changes, can produce electrostatic modifications on the reaction centre of the enzyme, as apparent from the dipolar response and the electric field distribution of the protein active site. Electric pulses above 5x10<sup>8</sup> V/m produced a fast transition between the folded and a partially denatured state, as inferred by the secondary structures analysis. Finally, for the highest field intensity used (7x10<sup>8</sup> V/m), a not reversible transition toward an unfolded state was observed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Superoxide is generated by many life processes, which include aerobic metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and photosynthesis, respiratory burst in the immune response of stimulated macrophages and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref001">1</xref>]. Superoxide-dependent formation of hydroxyl radicals (including the superoxide ones) is essential in oxygen toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref003">3</xref>]. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause an inflammation and cell and tissue injuries accompanied by DNA damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref005">5</xref>]. ROSs lay background for the arising of human pathologies, including ischemic reperfusion injury, cardiovascular disease, cancer, aging and neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) takes part to the cellular antioxidant defence mechanism, inactivating the superoxide radical O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref009">9</xref>] at some of the fastest enzyme rates known. It essentially acts as a master key, controlling cellular ROS levels, with potential use as therapeutic agents in oxidative stress-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref010">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Specifically, the Cu/Zn-SOD (or SOD1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref013">13</xref>] is a homodimeric metalloenzyme containing in each subunit a catalytic copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) metal ions that are essential for dismutation reaction of the superoxide radical O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. To prevent the accumulation of the O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> radical, in the first step of the dismutation reaction, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> is oxidized by Cu<sup>2+</sup> to molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and subsequently a second superoxide anion is reduced by Cu<sup>+</sup> to produce hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>Recent studies experimentally investigated the role of the SOD1 in ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), finding an alteration of the glutamate release in the mice spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref014">14</xref>], while other ones found abnormal expression of the SOD1 in patients affected by neuronal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref016">16</xref>]. Moreover, it has been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref018">18</xref>] that the accumulation of the O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> radical, causing oxidative stress, is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases as is the ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref019">19</xref>] or in the Parkinson disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>All these findings evidence an important role of the SOD1 dismutation reaction as well as of the diffusion rate of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> nearby the SOD1 reaction centre. The structure of the SOD1 active site reveals important features as hydrogen-bonding and metal-binding motifs making possible a mechanism known as &#8216;electrostatic guidance&#8217; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref022">22</xref>], that promotes dismutation reaction with time scales faster than O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> diffusion rate. Such a mechanism, firstly proposed by Getzoff and colleagues in 1983 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref013">13</xref>], hypothesizes that the arrangement of electrostatic charges around the active site of SOD1 promotes productive enzyme-substrate interaction through substrate guidance and charge complementarity.</p>
<p>Electrostatic guidance is a highly susceptible mechanism since the arrangement of charges at the active site is dependent on the morphology and dynamics of the overall enzyme. It has been demonstrated that even a single site mutation in Cu/Zn-SOD is transduced in more flexible regions of the proteins, i.e. the loops surrounding the active site, generating easier accessibility of the copper atom to the substrate, and hence changing the enzymatic rate of reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>A &#8216;non-specific&#8217; way to modulate electrostatic environment is through an external physical stimulus, such as pH or temperature, which, inducing a local or global unfolding of the protein, modifies protein secondary and tertiary structures, thus affecting the rate of reaction. For the SOD1, thermal or pH variations have proven by either experimental or numerical recent results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref024">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref026">26</xref>] to couple with the protein structure having an ultimate effect on its functionality.</p>
<p>Another way to affect the protein electrostatic environment is through the action of electric fields. A significant fraction of cytosolic proteins is exposed to strong endogenous electric fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref027">27</xref>], which have been found capable to modulate enzyme catalysis as demonstrated in experiments utilizing the vibrational Stark effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref028">28</xref>]. For protein crystals the use of an external electric field stimulation in the order of 10<sup>8</sup> V/m combined with X-ray crystallography has been recently proven to reveal protein mechanics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref029">29</xref>], mediated by the coupling of the field with the electrostatics of the protein. Moreover, external electric fields of almost comparable intensities, exploited in the last years for new technologies at the basis of potential biomedical applications, seem to couple with internal compartments of the cell and among them with proteins. Nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) have been proven to activate membrane proteins in response to a single or a repeated pulse application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref030">30</xref>], to interact with inner cell organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref032">32</xref>] and with cytosol proteins and enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref033">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite the wide range of endogenous and/or exogenous electric fields, to our knowledge there is limited evidence of a coupling with SOD1 enzyme. Therefore, given the sensitivity of the SOD1 active site to external physical agents and the widespread use of intense electric fields for cell manipulation, it seemed of particular interest to elucidate how nsPEFs can affect electrostatic environment even in view of the master key role of SOD1 in controlling ROS levels inside cells.</p>
<p>Electrostatic environment of protein active site is usually evaluated by means of computational models. Few experiments, providing evidence of a direct measure of the electrostatic fields at the active site of enzymes through vibrational Stark effect (VSE) applied to specific probes, are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref037">37</xref>]. However, this kind of technique is highly complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref038">38</xref>] and several criteria must be met for calibrated probes transitions to be useful in measuring electric fields inside a protein environment. For example: the probe transition must be incorporated into the protein of interest; its spectrum should be easily separated from that of the protein itself; the labelling of the protein with a non-native bulky dye has the potential to perturb the native electrostatics to such an extent that the biological function under investigation can be significantly altered or destroyed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Conversely, computational models are becoming increasingly affordable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref039">39</xref>]. The high performances of computing resources, accompanied by refined protein design methodologies, has allowed the design of increasingly sophisticated proteins with diverse topologies and functions. Protein dynamics ranging from local fluctuations around equilibrium conformations to large-scale conformational changes upon binding can be captured by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which use a physics-based potential energy function to simulate protein dynamics as a function of time according to classical Newtonian mechanics. While biophysical techniques, such as NMR spectroscopy, can yield insights into protein dynamics, MD has the power not only to identify functionally relevant conformations, which may be &#8216;hidden&#8217; to experimental techniques, but it can also provide the details of transitions between these conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>The hypothesis we tested using MD simulations, was the possibility to modulate the SOD1 active site electric environment by external intense electric fields similar to the one used in nsPEFs applications.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we observed the response of SOD1 to the application of a 100 nsPEF with different intensities (in line with literature numerical studies from 10<sup>8</sup> to 7x10<sup>8</sup> V/m) and different shapes (Monopolar and Bipolar). For electric field intensities below the unfolding threshold, we studied the pattern of the electrostatic distribution at the reaction site of the enzyme, as a marker. We numerically evaluated maps of the electrostatic field distribution of the SOD1 active site, looking for a modulation of the electrostatic environment. Such interaction can be considered as the first step of a cascade of events culminating in overall cell response.</p>

<p>The environment where the SOD1 enzyme was immersed consists of a rectangular box (10 x 11 x 9 nm<sup>3</sup>) containing 32292 single point charge (SPC) water molecules with 9 Na<sup>+</sup> counterions, for a total of 99659 atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

The temperature was kept constant at 300 K by the V-rescale thermostat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref044">44</xref>] which provides a consistent statistical mechanical behavior. All bond lengths were constrained using the LINCS algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref045">45</xref>]. Long range electrostatics were computed by the Particle Mesh Ewald method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref046">46</xref>] with 34 wave vectors in each dimension and a 4th order cubic interpolation. The GROMOS96 force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref047">47</xref>] parameters were adopted. Short range interactions were evaluated within a 1.1 nm cut off radius.</p>
<p>Once obtained an extended equilibrated-unexposed trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) we evaluated possible effects due to the intensity and the specificity of a single nsPEF by applying either a Monopolar or a Bipolar electric pulse (referred to hereinafter as MP and BP, respectively). The MP presents rise and fall times of 2 ns duration and a hold time (t<sub>ON</sub>) of 100 ns; the trajectory has been prolonged for 50 ns (t<sub>OFF</sub>) after the pulse switch-off. The BP presents the same rise and fall times durations, while a 50 ns duration for the positive pole (t<sub>ON positive</sub>), before reverting the amplitude of the field for the following 50 ns (t<sub>ON negative</sub>). The trajectory has been prolonged for 50 ns (t<sub>OFF</sub>) even in this case.</p>
<p>We implemented these MP and BP signals inside MD simulations by modifying the <italic>sim_util</italic> library inside the Gromacs package. The E field intensity for both signals was ranged from 10<sup>8</sup> to 7x10<sup>8</sup> V/m, acting on all atoms within the simulation box as explained in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref048">48</xref>].</p>

<title>RMSD, radius of gyration and solvent accessible area</title>
<p>To quantify the protein atoms positions during the MD simulation we computed the RMSD (root-mean-square deviation). The RMSD provides a quantitative measure of the protein structural variations, comparing the electric field exposure and the equilibrium state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref043">43</xref>]. To quantify the distribution of the atoms in the space relative to their own centre of mass, we also computed the radius of gyration, which can provide an understanding of the changes in shape and size of the protein under the influence of external stress. The extent to which an amino acid interacts with the solvent and the protein core is naturally proportional to the surface area exposed to these environments, hence we calculated both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic solvent accessible surface area (SASA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref043">43</xref>].</p>

<title>Dipole moment spectrogram</title>
<p>Usually proteins, due to their secondary structure conformation (&#945;-helices, &#946;-sheets, turns, coils, etc.) possess an electric dipole moment and when an external electric field is applied, the protein orients itself in the direction of the field. The spectrogram is a time-frequency representation, able to describe the spectral content of a signal, obtained as the square modulus of the short time Fourier transform algorithm. This algorithm is implying the windowing of the temporal signal under analysis and the fast Fourier transform of each time sequence. Here, temporal sequences 4.0x10<sup>-11</sup> s long filtered through a Hamming passband filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref050">50</xref>], with 50% overlap between adjacent segments have been chosen. We obtained a frequency resolution of 0.25 GHz and a time resolution of 6 ns.</p>
<p>In our study, the electric field was applied in the y-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We valued these changes by the analysis of the frequency spectral content of the dipole moment of protein and water molecules. This outcome has been evaluated both considering the application of an electric field of 10<sup>8</sup> V/m and a temperature increase of 35 degrees (335 K, SOD1 melting temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref051">51</xref>]) to compare the different molecules&#8217; response.</p>

<title>Electrostatic distribution at the active site</title>
<p>With the aim to study the rigorous electric field distribution within the active site region, we constructed local electric field maps (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0221685.e001">Eq (1)</xref>), given by the explicit coulombic contribution of all surrounding atoms (protein, water and Na ions), as already performed for another protein in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref052">52</xref>]. This is in line to what noted in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref053">53</xref>] where it is suggested that implicit models based on Poisson function and values of dielectric constants can give an inadequate description of the heterogeneous protein environment.</p>
<p>We investigated the effects of a single MP or BP 100 nsPEF with an intensity of E<sub>y</sub> = 10<sup>8</sup> V/m, comparing the results with the ones obtained in equilibrium conditions. We performed such calculations on two representative 2D planes (4.7 x 4.7 nm<sup>2</sup>) centered in the Cu<sup>2+</sup> position (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

<title>Electric field threshold for structural effects</title>
<p>A comparative analysis is carried out between the structure of SOD1 enzyme in &#8220;No- field&#8221; conditions and when exposed to the external electric field stimulus. The goal is to define a threshold for the intensity of the E field able to electrically or geometrically manipulate the SOD1 enzyme.</p>
<p>To this end, the average numbers of Coil and &#946;-Sheet secondary structures have been evaluated for decreasing field intensities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g003">Fig 3</xref>, panel C), comparing the &#8220;No field&#8221; condition with a set of MP and BP signals. Student&#8217;s t test revealed a threshold for relevant conformational changes (above 10%) for an E field intensity of 5x10<sup>8</sup> V/m. The highest intensity used (7x10<sup>8</sup> V/m) produces dramatic structural rearrangements, probably associated to an irreversible unfolding transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref056">56</xref>], since we observed a maximum loss of &#946;-Sheets up to 37% and an increase of the coil secondary complexes up to 28%. For the lowest field intensities adopted (10<sup>8</sup> and 2x10<sup>8</sup> V/m) the effects are subtle (&lt; 5% structural variation either for the coil structures or for &#946;-Sheets ones) and not statistically significant.</p>

<p>The 10<sup>8</sup> V/m MP is not able to induce noticeable changes in any of the observables considered, confirming that such intensity is not able neither to induce structural modifications of the protein nor to determine any variation in the parameters usually adopted for monitoring protein changes.

<title>Electrostatic coupling mechanism</title>
<p>Although the lowest intensity of 10<sup>8</sup> V/m is not able to induce structural changes, a not negligible coupling with the protein electrostatics is expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref048">48</xref>], due to the dipolar mechanism, either mediated by the solvating water or acting straight on the enzyme.</p>
<p>Under the influence of an external E field, the protein residues, as well as water molecules, are subject to a reorientation quantified by their dipole moment.</p>
<p>To this end, we calculated both the protein and the solvation-water dipoles alignment under MP and BP signals, comparing them to the values obtained without any exposure. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g006">Fig 6</xref> such a coupling is evaluated by means of the spectrogram of the dipole y-component M<sub>y</sub> (spectrograms associated to the total dipole (M<sub>TOT</sub>) are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221685.s002">S2 Fig</xref> for a complete view), since the polarization process essentially occurs along the exogenous field direction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

<p>In No-field condition, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g006">Fig 6</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> row, 2nd column), the frequency content associated to water dipole dynamics easily reaches the 1 GHz limit for the whole observation time, while a lower frequency of about 700 MHz, or less, is observed for the protein dipole dynamics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g006">Fig 6</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> row,1st column). When the 10<sup>8</sup> V/m MP or BP are applied, we witness a strong dipolar reorientation of water molecules, which amplifies the spectrogram response in correspondence of the signal variations (note the output spectral power density during the signal&#8217;s rise and fall times). In particular, for the MP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g006">Fig 6</xref>, 2nd raw), the rise and fall times of the signal are clearly visible, coupled to an increase in the output spectral power density. Similarly, for the BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g006">Fig 6</xref>, 3rd raw) the reversal of the signal polarity is clearly observable in the increase of the spectral content at the middle of the signal course.</p>
<p>As expected, when considering the behaviour of the protein dipole alone a similar trend is observed, although with marked lower spectral power densities. This is essentially due to the relatively low polarizability of the target. Therefore, SOD1 needs more time to reorient, nonetheless it is still able to couple to the external electric signals.</p>

<title>Electrostatic coupling on SOD1 active site</title>
<p>To fully exploit the potentialities of the external electric field to affect the electrostatic environment of SOD1, we investigated the <italic>local</italic> electric field distribution on the active site of one of the two dimers (dashed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and magnified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analysis was driven by previous works by D&#8217;Alessandro and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref040">40</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref042">42</xref>], where authors, combining mixed QM/MM methods with basic statistical mechanical relations, were able to study the chemical events and the atomic motions of the complex environment of the SOD1 reaction centre, pointing out a dramatic effect of the electrostatic field due to protein and solvent interactions on free energy surface at the active site.</p>
<p>Here we went to a finer evaluation of the contribution of protein and solvent to the active site in terms of maps of electric field distribution with a sub-Angstrom spatial resolution. We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g007">Fig 7</xref> the electric field shifts due to the applied MP and BP signals on the two representative planes &#960;&#8216; and &#960;&#8220;described in Materials and Methods (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221685.s003">S3 Fig</xref> for the electric field map in the reference no-field condition). Both signals are able to modify the electrostatic map of the active site in the central region around the copper ion position. However, the change produced by the BP presents a more diffused and uniform distribution with the same sign, suggesting a possible rotation of specific protein residues, and hence a charge distribution alteration, due to the external field action.</p>

<p>In order to have a further indication of the external field effect on the active site environment, following some interesting studies claiming that local electrostatic fields can perturb pKa values of ionisable residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref057">57</xref>], we calculated pKa values for the four residues: His 63 and His 120, Asp 83 and His 71, known to be fundamental for the reaction process, since they affect the electron transfer process as reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g008">Fig 8</xref> we present pKa data of the four residues for the BP pulse, distinguishing two contributions: during the pulse and the 50 ns after the pulse itself. Results indicate a clear shift of pKa values, suggesting that the 10<sup>8</sup> V/m BP signal is able to affect the local environment at SOD1 reactive site. In particular the most significant data (p&lt;0.001) are observable after the pulse, indicating a cumulative effect on all the residues. Moreover, the most dramatically affected seems to be the Asp 81, where the effect is related to an inversion of the sign of pKa with respect to the no-field condition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we chose to explore the effects of MP and BP nsPEFs coupling with the electrostatics of the Cu/Zn-SOD enzyme. The aim has been to define the intensity of the field able to interact with the SOD1 enzyme and to modulate the electrostatic environment at the active site without implying major changes in protein conformation. Besides this, thresholds for reversible and irreversible denaturation of the SOD1 under the application of nsPEFs have been identified. MP and BP signals, chosen as representative of typical nsPEFs signals, have been implemented for the first time in the Gromacs environment for MD simulations.</p>
<p>The coupling with the applied external electric field can be split in a direct action of the field on the dipolar aminoacidic residues of the enzyme and an indirect action of the field mediated by the presence of the solvating water. It has already demonstrated in the past how solvating water can interact with intense electric fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref058">58</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref060">60</xref>]. By the analysis of the coil and &#946;-Sheets secondary structures, we evidence here the direct contribution of the field. We identified three different electric field thresholds for structural effects: <italic>(i)</italic> with E field intensities lower than 2x10<sup>8</sup> V/m small (and fully reversible) changes (5%) were appreciated; <italic>(ii)</italic> when a E field of 5x10<sup>8</sup> V/m is applied, variations around 23% are reported, with an almost complete structural recovery within 50 ns after the E pulse removal; <italic>(iii)</italic> a severe denaturation when the protein is exposed to an electric pulse of 7x10<sup>8</sup> V/m, not reversible within the 50 ns switch-off period. For completeness, also a thermal perturbation has been considered, in order to compare the structural effects of a 35&#176;K (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221685.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) temperature increase, which is known to experimentally induce a temperature-dependent unfolding transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref051">51</xref>], with the ones induced by the field. The simulation data, obtained by heating the system, show no effects, conceivably due to the different kinetics of temperature-induced and E field-induced unfolding transitions. This also confirms what already predicted in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref056">56</xref>], where pulsed electric fields induced structural changes in the secondary structure of lysozyme that are not equivalent to those caused by thermal stress.</p>
<p>The electric field intensities identified are in line with modelling and experimental literature, ranging from 10<sup>7</sup> to 7x10<sup>8</sup> V/m, since it is already known that intense electric fields are needed to act on biomolecular processes inside cells. The majority of membrane proteins are naturally exposed to strong electric fields that range in strength from 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> V/m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref061">61</xref>] and the ability of electric fields to modulate the structure of integral membrane proteins is a central dogma in voltage gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref062">62</xref>]. Conversely, cytosol proteins are less studied in presence of E fields. To this regard, apart from few studies that have an experimental validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref056">56</xref>], the majority of the investigations are realized on the basis of molecular simulations. In particular, several endpoints have been explored using MD simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref063">63</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref071">71</xref>] such as: the effects of external electric field on the stability of protein conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref064">64</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref066">66</xref>], the stability of &#946;-Sheets structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref069">69</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref071">71</xref>], the dependence of the field on the polarization of water molecules and the role of water in hydrophilic proteins, where in the interfacial gap, it forms an adhesive hydrogen-bond network between the interfaces, stabilizing early intermediates before native contacts are formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref072">72</xref>]. Almost all the papers reporting effects on the coupling of electric fields and proteins refer to intensities higher than 10<sup>8</sup> V/m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref073">73</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref077">77</xref>], even in the case of recent papers giving contributions in comprehending the complete unfolding process of a protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref078">78</xref>].</p>
<p>Besides the identification of the unfolding pathways through the analysis of secondary structures, we also quantified the SOD1 protein structural rearrangements through the computation of the RMSD, the radius of gyration and the solvent accessible area. For the lowest intensity here used (10<sup>8</sup> V/m) negligible effects are observed.</p>
<p>To explore the polarization of the system we studied the spectrograms of both the protein and the solvating water dipoles, comparing the reference (No field) condition with the ones relative to the two kinds of electric pulses considered (10<sup>8</sup> V/m MP and BP). When the 10<sup>8</sup> V/m electric stimulus is applied, the SOD1 dipole follows the external signal in its shape, showing a high degree of polarizability when compared to the reference condition. This result suggests an efficient electric coupling between the external E field and the SOD1 protein.</p>
<p>In the study previously cited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref021">21</xref>], the electrostatic guidance mechanism has been computationally exploited to enhance a reaction (i.e. oxygen and hydrogen peroxide at the active-site Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion) that is rate-limited by diffusion. Getzoff and colleagues have shown that the site-specific mutants produce electrostatically facilitated diffusion rates, maintaining the detailed structural integrity of the active-site electrostatic network.</p>
<p>In the present paper, we envisage a critical role of the electric coupling between the protein dipole moment and the MP and BP signals in modifying the electric forces acting on the Cu/Zn-SOD active site. Strengthened by use of computational methods based on MD, we have been able to carry out this study in terms of highly resolved 2D maps of the electric field distribution on two planes passing through the Cu<sup>2+</sup> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> coordinates. By the investigation of the electric field maps, both MP and BP produced significant electrostatic shifts with respect with the reference condition. In particular, a broader square area spanning 1 nm apart in both directions of the plane from the copper ion position, is visible for both MP and BP, but far more relevant for the BP. Moreover, relevant pKa changes in four important residues (among the ones involved in the active site) suggest possible effect on the local environment at SOD1 reaction centre.</p>
<p>The question is: can we speculate about possible consequences of an E field-induced perturbation at the active site on the diffusion of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> radical towards the Cu<sup>2+</sup>? If one looks at the electric field shift in the central region of both the representative planes &#960;&#8217; and &#960;&#8221;, where the radical approaches the copper ion prior to the electron transfer process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref040">40</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g002">Fig 2b</xref>), islands of positive electric field gradients emerge, to the point that the corresponding forces can act on O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> ion to drive its movement in the desired direction (the BP, in particular, has proved to provide excellent results). This means that sufficiently high intense electric pulses could, in principle, establish a sort of <italic>ion-trap</italic> in a distance-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0221685.ref079">79</xref>]. Even in this case, the thermal stimulus does not affect the electrostatic environment hereby described (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221685.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, the investigation here reported unveiled different modalities for the interaction mechanisms between ultra-short pulsed electric fields and the enzyme target.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The lowest field used, 10<sup>8</sup> V/m, turned out to be a threshold intensity able to affect the electrostatic environment of the enzyme active site. Such electrostatic variation may as a final step act as an effective electrostatic guidance. This happens without irreversible modifications or impact on protein functions, as derived from the dipole moment analysis, showing a protein that can reorient itself following the external field applied at the threshold intensity of 10<sup>8</sup> V/m without irreversible polarization (i.e. after the signal&#8217;s switch-off the structure fully recovers its physiological polarization state).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Significant structural changes are visible when electric field intensities starting from 5x10<sup>8</sup> V/m are applied. Interestingly, two different protein fates are predicted: i) the 100 ns 5x10<sup>8</sup> V/m MP and BP signals are not able to induce a complete unfolding transition for the SOD enzyme, with a partially denatured state (obtained at the end of the 100 ns pulse) fully recovered during the signal&#8217;s switch-off period; ii) the 100 ns 7x10<sup>8</sup> V/m MP and BP produced a fast transition (occurring within few ns) between folded and unfolded states, as inferred by secondary structures and geometrical analysis. In this case, the signal&#8217;s switch off does not produce any significant structural recovery.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The signal&#8217;s characteristics seem another key-point in the interaction mechanism, as apparent from Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221685.g008">8</xref>. In the present study, the BP signal turned out to produce a more efficient coupling with the enzyme, both in terms of structural and dipolar effects.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This numerical study can be considered as a starting point for possible prediction of future experiments on the superoxide dismutase protein and it can be considered as the basis to investigate the interaction of nsPEFs electric fields with enzymes.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: The authors try to explore the effect of electric field on enzyme active sites</p>

<p>Reviewer #2: The authors present a molecular dynamics simulation study exploring the effect of electric field pulses on the superoxide dismutase protein. There are two main motivations for this study as presented by the authors: (i) to understand the structural stability of the protein in respect to an external electric field and (ii) to explore the possibility that the external electric field modifies the electrostatic guidance, i.e., the local electric potential that drives the superoxide to Cu2+ for the catalytic electron-transfer reaction. The goal (i) was already studied in a number of previous papers and the authors confirm the basic conclusion that sufficiently strong fields lead to partial protein denaturation. Question (ii) is potentially more novel and I believe here the authors' analysis was insufficient.</p>
<p>The authors explore the distribution of the electric field, and its modification by an external pulse, in the vicinity of the active site. The first question to ask here: why should one care about the electric field? The ability of the superoxide to reach the active site should be driven by the potential of mean force, a free energy, and not by the electric field, which provides the force at a local point. I believe the authors are not calculating the property which is critical for the question they have posed. I also have significant questions regarding how the electric field was calculated. The calculation is based on eq 1, which is the Coulomb law in vacuum. The resulting numbers are based on the magnitudes of partial charges and the distances to them. This is clearly not the entire picture. Electrostatic interactions are screened by water. Near the protein surface one cannot simply used the bulk dielectric constant of 78 and one has to specifically calculate the electric field by the water dipoles. However, the crudest estimate suggests that the numbers presented by the authors are overestimated by a factor of ~78. This is clearly not acceptable. In addition, I assume simulations were done in the standard Ewald protocol. Therefore, Ewald corrections have to be used in the calculation of the electric field as well. The calculations presented by the authors have no physical meaning unless these problems are addressed.</p>
<p>It would be useful to have a consistency check for the electrostatic calculations. Can pKa be calculated to make sure the results are solid? None of the plots presented in the paper are testable by observations. The authors should make some minimum effort to connect to the observable reality.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1: The authors try to explore the effect of electric field on enzyme active sites by exploring the response to field of SOD.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the paper does not present a comparison between calculated and observed values. This includes the argument that the rate changes. Unless I missed something the paper is compared to some experiments. I cannot see advantage in publication</p>
<p>It seems that our initial statement was not sufficiently clear, and we apologize for this.</p>
<p>We tried to improve clarity changing the introduction, materials and methods and discussion as evidenced in the text of the new version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The manuscript is a fully computational study aimed to investigate possible response of the SOD1 enzyme to the application of intense electric field pulses. We do not address specific experimental data to compare with, but the references to experimental works are aimed to demonstrate that a response is feasible and worthwhile to be deepen, due also to the biomedical and biotechnological potentialities as evidenced in [Beebe SJ. Considering effects of nanosecond pulsed electric fields on proteins. Bioelectrochemistry. 2015; 103: 52&#8211;59].</p>
<p>Computational models are becoming increasingly affordable [M C Childers and V Daggett, Insights from molecular dynamics simulations for computational protein design, Mol. Syst. Des. Eng., 2017, 2, 9]. The high performances of computing resources, accompanied by refined protein design methodologies, has allowed for the design of increasingly sophisticated proteins with diverse topologies and functions. Protein dynamics, ranging from local fluctuations around equilibrium conformations to large-scale conformational changes upon binding can be captured by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which uses a physics-based potential energy function to simulate protein dynamics as a function of time according to classical Newtonian mechanics. While biophysical techniques, such as NMR spectroscopy, can yield insights into protein dynamics, MD has the power not only to identify functionally relevant conformations, which may be &#8216;hidden&#8217; to experimental techniques, but it can also provide the details of transitions between these conformations [M C Childers and V Daggett, Insights from molecular dynamics simulations for computational protein design, Mol. Syst. Des. Eng., 2017, 2, 9].</p>
<p>The hypothesis we tested using MD simulations, was the possibility to modulate the SOD1 active site electric environment by external intense electric fields as the ones produced in nsPEFs applications. For these reasons, we observed the response of SOD1 to external electric fields, studying whether this enzyme results sensitive to the application of a 100 nsPEF with different characteristics.</p>
<p>Fully atomistic MD studies are acquiring and increasing importance and are finding increasing acceptance in top level journal as PlOS ONE. For example only in the year 2019 there are 8 fully computational (MD) papers puplished in PlOS ONE (see below). Therefore, we believe that even in absence of experimental data our manuscript can be of interest of this journal.</p>

<p>Reviewer #2: The authors present a molecular dynamics simulation study exploring the effect of electric field pulses on the superoxide dismutase protein. There are two main motivations for this study as presented by the authors: (i) to understand the structural stability of the protein in respect to an external electric field and (ii) to explore the possibility that the external electric field modifies the electrostatic guidance, i.e., the local electric potential that drives the superoxide to Cu2+ for the catalytic electron-transfer reaction. The goal (i) was already studied in a number of previous papers and the authors confirm the basic conclusion that sufficiently strong fields lead to partial protein denaturation. Question (ii) is potentially more novel and I believe here the authors&#8217; analysis was insufficient.</p>
<p>The authors explore the distribution of the electric field, and its modification by an external pulse, in the vicinity of the active site. The first question to ask here: why should one care about the electric field? The ability of the superoxide to reach the active site should be driven by the potential of mean force, a free energy, and not by the electric field, which provides the force at a local point. I believe the authors are not calculating the property which is critical for the question they have posed. </p>
<p>The referee asked a very interesting question that we do not properly addressed in the previous version of the manuscript. Our analysis was driven by previous works by D&#8217;Alessandro et al. and Amadei et al. [M. D'Alessandro, M. Aschi, M. Paci, A. Di Nola and A. Amadei Theoretical modeling of enzyme reactions chemistry: the electron transfer of the reduction mechanism in CuZn Superoxide Dismutase. J. Phys. Chem. B 108(41) 16255-16260 (2004); A. Amadei, M. D'Alessandro, M. Paci, A. Di Nola and M. Aschi On the Effect of a Point Mutation on the Reactivity of CuZn Superoxide Dismutase: A Theoretical Study. J. Phys. Chem. B 110(14),7538-7544 (2006)] where authors combined mixed QM/MM methods with basic statistical mechanical relations to study the chemical events and the atomic motions of the complex environment of the SOD1 reaction center. Their results clearly showed that the protein-solvent environment fluctuations are essential to understand the reaction mechanism which is based on the concerted rupture of the copper-histidine coordination bond and the copper-superoxide bond in the active site. Such environmental fluctuations have been conceived as a perturbation electric potential exerted by  the environment on the quantum center, hence the sum of each elementary electric potential produced by i) water molecules solvating the protein; ii) counterions; iii) all protein atoms not belonging to the reactive center (treated via QM methods).</p>
<p>Amadei et al. concluded that such perturbing environmental electric field is essential for the modelling of the reaction process, pointing out dramatic effect of the protein and solvent interactions on free energy surface at the quantum center.</p>
<p>In the present work, we wanted to ask the question if an exogenous electric perturbation (in addition to the endogenous one) can significantly modify the electric environment at the quantum center, tackling the problem with a classical approach, i.e. established that the reaction free energy is affected by the local electric field at the active site.</p>
<p>I also have significant questions regarding how the electric field was calculated. The calculation is based on eq 1, which is the Coulomb law in vacuum. The resulting numbers are based on the magnitudes of partial charges and the distances to them. This is clearly not the entire picture. Electrostatic interactions are screened by water. Near the protein surface one cannot simply used the bulk dielectric constant of 78 and one has to specifically calculate the electric field by the water dipoles. However, the crudest estimate suggests that the numbers presented by the authors are overestimated by a factor of ~78. This is clearly not acceptable. In addition, I assume simulations were done in the standard Ewald protocol. Therefore, Ewald corrections have to be used in the calculation of the electric field as well. The calculations presented by the authors have no physical meaning unless these problems are addressed.</p>
<p>The referee is right; we just presented an oversimplified version of the perturbing field calculation. What we actually did is now presented in more details in the new version of the manuscript. Such perturbing field is an atomic electric  field (on  the order of GV/m),  made  by  three  terms:  the  first  one  representing  the perturbation due to each aminoacidic residue of the protein, the second which considers the perturbation due to local electric field  generated  by  water  molecules, the last one due the presence of couterions. </p>
<p>The new Eq. 1 now explicitly takes into account the contribution of all the constituents of the simulation box, as also explained in [Francesca Apollonio, Andrea Amadei, Micaela Liberti, Massimiliano Aschi, Monica Pellegrino, Maira D'Alessandro, Marco D'Abramo, Alfredo Di Nola, Guglielmo d'Inzeo Mixed Quantum-Classical Methods for Molecular Simulations of Biochemical Reactions with Microwave Fields: the Case Study of Myoglobin. IEEE T  Microw. Theory  56(11), 2511-2519 (2008)] for a different protein, with all simulation data already taking into account Ewald corrections. Also note that MD systems correspond to needle-like ellipsoidal systems with the applied field along the major axis, hence no depolarizing field is present in the simulations.</p>
<p>We hope the issue raised by the referee is now clarified, the electric field perturbation at the active site was explicitly calculated at full atomistic scale.</p>
<p>It would be useful to have a consistency check for the electrostatic calculations. Can pKa be calculated to make sure the results are solid? None of the plots presented in the paper are testable by observations. The authors should make some minimum effort to connect to the observable reality.</p>
<p>The point raised by the referee drove us to calculate pKa values for some specific residues at the active site known to be fundamental for the reaction process. </p>
<p>D&#8217;Alessandro et al. [M. D'Alessandro, M. Aschi, M. Paci, A. Di Nola and A. Amadei Theoretical modeling of enzyme reactions chemistry: the electron transfer of the reduction mechanism in CuZn Superoxide Dismutase. J. Phys. Chem. B 108(41) 16255-16260 (2004)] already investigated the endogenous electric perburbation effects on such residues, evidencing the relevance of each residue for the catalytic process. In general, residues producing a positive average electric field projected along the Cu-O2- bond favour the electron transfer process, while negative average electric fields are associated to inhibitory effects. </p>
<p>Then, we analysed via PROPKA algorithm [Improved treatment of ligands and coupling effects in empirical calculation and rationalization of pKa values. S&#248;ndergaard CR, Olsson MHM, Rostkowski M, Jensen JH. J Chem Theory Comput. 2011;7(7):2284-95] the specific residues indicated in [A. Amadei, M. D'Alessandro, M. Paci, A. Di Nola and M. Aschi On the Effect of a Point Mutation on the Reactivity of CuZn Superoxide Dismutase: A Theoretical Study. J. Phys. Chem. B 110(14),7538-7544 (2006)] to affect the electronic transfer process.</p>
<p>We added in the new version of the manuscript a new Figure (Fig. 8), where we present pKa data of four fundamental residues: i) His 63 and His 120, directly involved in the reaction process; ii) Asp 83, which is known to favour the electron transfer; iii) His 71, which is known to inhibit the electron transfer. Data are presented together with their standard deviations, obtained collecting data of the simulation equilibrium states (150 ns before pulse application, last 50 ns of the bipolar pulse and 50 ns after the bipolar pulse removal).</p>
<p>Results indicate a significant effect on pKa values for all the considered residues (p-values have been calculated between reference and field-exposed populations), suggesting that a single high intensity (10^8 V/m) bipolar pulse is able to affect the local environment at SOD1 reactive site. In particular, negative variations of pKa values are associated to the build-up of a negative charge on residue side chain. Interestingly, such effects are consistent with the ones presented in Fig. 7, where the electric field shifts (absolute values) due to the applied Bipolar pulse was supposed to be a  consequence of possible rotation of specific protein residues, and hence a charge distribution alteration.</p>
<p>All the above discussion and clarifications have been added in the main text.</p>
