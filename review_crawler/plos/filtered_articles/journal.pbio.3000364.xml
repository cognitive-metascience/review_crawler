<abstract>
<p>Many eukaryotic microbes have complex life cycles that include both sexual and asexual phases with strict species specificity. Whereas the asexual cycle of the protistan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> can occur in any warm-blooded mammal, the sexual cycle is restricted to the feline intestine. The molecular determinants that identify cats as the definitive host for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> are unknown. Here, we defined the mechanism of species specificity for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual development and break the species barrier to allow the sexual cycle to occur in mice. We determined that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual development occurs when cultured feline intestinal epithelial cells are supplemented with linoleic acid. Felines are the only mammals that lack delta-6-desaturase activity in their intestines, which is required for linoleic acid metabolism, resulting in systemic excess of linoleic acid. We found that inhibition of murine delta-6-desaturase and supplementation of their diet with linoleic acid allowed <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual development in mice. This mechanism of species specificity is the first defined for a parasite sexual cycle. This work highlights how host diet and metabolism shape coevolution with microbes. The key to unlocking the species boundaries for other eukaryotic microbes may also rely on the lipid composition of their environments as we see increasing evidence for the importance of host lipid metabolism during parasitic lifecycles. Pregnant women are advised against handling cat litter, as maternal infection with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> can be transmitted to the fetus with potentially lethal outcomes. Knowing the molecular components that create a conducive environment for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual reproduction will allow for development of therapeutics that prevent shedding of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> parasites. Finally, given the current reliance on companion animals to study <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual development, this work will allow the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> field to use of alternative models in future studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The apicomplexan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> causes a chronic infection in nearly one-third of the human population and is well known for causing congenital infections leading to blindness, mental retardation, and hydrocephaly of the developing fetus. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> has a complex life cycle containing both sexual and asexual phases. The <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> asexual cycle can occur in any warm-blooded animal when contaminated food or water is consumed and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> disseminates throughout the host, converting to an encysted form in muscle and brain tissue. In contrast, the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual cycle is restricted to the feline intestinal epithelium, culminating in the excretion of environmentally resistant oocysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref001">1</xref>]. The molecular basis for this species specificity is unknown.</p>
<p>During feline infection, the ingested bradyzoites are released by pepsin and acid digestion in the stomach. Bradyzoites then invade the feline intestinal epithelium and differentiate into five morphologically distinct types of schizonts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref002">2</xref>]. Within 2 days in the feline intestine, parasites progress through all five stages of schizonts and then develop into merozoites. The merozoites undergo a limited proliferation of two to four doublings before they differentiate into macrogametes and microgametes. The macro- and microgametes fuse to produce diploid oocysts, which develop thick impermeable walls and are shed in the feces. Cats usually excrete 2&#8211;20 million oocysts per day in their feces and usually shed oocysts 5&#8211;10 days post infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref004">4</xref>]. In ambient air and temperature, oocysts undergo a sporulation process to mature and become infectious. Both mitosis and meiosis occur during sporulation to produce eight haploid sporozoites encased within the oocyst wall. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> oocysts are stable for 18 months in unfavorable environmental conditions and resistant to many chemical disinfectants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref005">5</xref>].</p>

<title>Linoleic acid is critical for sexual development in cultured cat cells</title>
<p>To determine the molecular mechanisms that define the species specificity of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual development, we generated cat intestinal organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000364.g001">Fig 1a</xref>) and then seeded these epithelial cells onto glass coverslips. These monolayers displayed intestinal epithelial properties, including polarization and tight junction formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000364.g001">Fig 1b</xref>). To simulate natural infection, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> was harvested from mouse brains 28&#8211;40 days after primary infection, and the parasites were released from the brain cysts by pepsin and acid digestion. After neutralization with sodium carbonate, parasites were seeded onto the cat intestinal monolayers, incubated for 5 days, and stained for markers of the parasite presexual stage called a merozoite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref007">7</xref>]. Although we observed occasional dense granule protein 11B (GRA11B) and bradyzoite rhoptry protein-1 (BRP1) staining, the vast majority of the culture was negative for these merozoite markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000364.g001">Fig 1c</xref>), suggesting that a required nutrient was limiting under these culture conditions. Because recent studies showed that the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> asexual stages scavenge fatty acids, particularly oleic acid, from the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref008">8</xref>] and that sexual development of many fungi is dependent on linoleic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref009">9</xref>], we surmised that supplementation with these fatty acids could facilitate <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual development. We added 200 &#956;M oleic or linoleic acid to cat intestinal monolayer culture medium 24 hours prior to infection with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>. After 5 days of infection, we found that the addition of linoleic acid but not oleic acid caused approximately 35% of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> to express both merozoite stage markers (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000364.g001">1d&#8211;1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000364.g002">2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000364.s004">S1 Data</xref>). Similarly, GRA11B mRNA was significantly more abundant in cat intestinal cells supplemented with linoleic acid compared to any other condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000364.g002">Fig 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000364.s005">S2 Data</xref>). As seen in vivo cat intestine, GRA11B changes localization from within the parasite dense granule organelles in the early stages of development to the parasitophorous vacuole and parasitophorous vacuole membrane in later stages of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref006">6</xref>]. We see similar localization of GRA11B depending on vacuole size, likely representing early, middle, and late stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000364.g001">Fig 1e&#8211;1g</xref>). Likewise, BRP1 has a localization similar to that previously seen in the rhoptry organelles in the apical end of the merozoite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref007">7</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000364.g001">Fig 1e&#8211;1g</xref>).</p>

<title>Quantification of merozoites in cat tissue culture.</title>
<p>(a) Cat intestinal organoids were disassociated by trypsin and then grown as monolayers on glass slides. Slides were divided into three different groups: not supplemented with FA, supplemented with 200 &#956;M OA, or supplemented with 200 &#956;M LA. Monolayers were infected with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> ME49 bradyzoites purified from brains of chronic infected mice at a 1:10 MOI. Five days after infection, staining for GRA11B and BRP1 along with DAPI allowed the percentage of vacuoles positive for GRA11B and BRP1 out of the total vacuoles to be determined. Total number of parasitophorous vacuoles were counted by positive DAPI staining and confirmed by morphology with DIC. Three biological replicates were counted, and on average, 35% of the total vacuoles were positive for both GRA11B and BRP1 in the LA-supplemented monolayers. *<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0126 with <italic>N</italic> = 3 by two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test. Straining for both BRP1 and GRA11B was used to ensure that merozoite stages were counted. RNAseq and immunofluorescent imaging of the cat intestinal epithelium show that GRA11B is exclusively expressed in merozoites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref006">6</xref>].

<p>Within the feline intestine, merozoites are known to differentiate into micro- and macrogametes that fuse to become diploid oocysts. After 7 days of infection, we saw round structures with reactivity to the macrogamete protein amine oxidase, copper-containing protein 2 (AO2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref010">10</xref>] in cat intestinal monolayers cultured with 200 &#956;M linoleic acid but not in unsupplemented or oleic acid&#8211;supplemented cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000364.g003">Fig 3a&#8211;3c</xref>).

<title>Identification of gametes and intracellular oocysts in cat tissue culture.</title>
<p>Cat intestinal organoids were disassociated by trypsin and then grown as monolayers on glass slides. Monolayers were grown to confluency and then were incubated with either no fatty acid supplementation (a and e), 200 &#956;M oleic acid (b and f), or 200 &#956;M linoleic acid (c and g) for 24 hours and infected with ME49 bradyzoites purified from brains of chronic infected mice. After 7 days, monolayers were incubated with mouse anti-AO2 (a&#8211;c) or mouse monoclonal IgM 3G4 (e&#8211;g). The amiloride-sensitive AO2 is an enzyme exclusively expressed in macrogametes and early oocysts and has a possible role in oocyst wall biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref010">10</xref>]. AO2 expression was only detected by immunofluorescence in the monolayers supplemented with linoleic acid (c). 3G4 is a mouse monoclonal antibody produced by immunizing mice with purified oocyst walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref011">11</xref>]; thus, it is a marker of oocyst wall biogenesis. Only monolayers supplemented with linoleic acid (g) had positive 3G4 vacuoles. All panels are 20 &#956;m<sup>2</sup> with a 5-&#956;m white size bar in the lower right corner. (d) Markers for macrogamete and microgamete expression were also evaluated by PCR. Cat intestinal monolayers were grown in 24-well plates until confluency and then infected with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> bradyzoites in duplicate using the same conditions as above. Seven days post infection, RNA was extracted with TRIzol, and cDNA was synthesized using an oligo (dT) primer to only amplify mRNA. AO2 was again used as a marker for macrogametes, and the expected PCR product is 218 bp. To assess microgamete presence, we selected the gene TgME49_306338, which is overexpressed in the gametes stage, corresponded to day 7 post infection in cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref012">12</xref>], and has 44% identity to a protein expressed in the flagella of the motile green algae <italic>C</italic>. <italic>reinhardtii</italic>. The expected PCR product for TgME49_306338 is 160 bp. TUB1A was used as an input control and results in a 172-bp product. &#8220;No RT&#8221; corresponds to a cDNA synthesis reaction without the addition of RT as a control for genomic DNA contamination. Equivalent amounts of cDNA per sample were used as a template for each PCR reaction, and the products were separated on an acrylamide gel. Bands with the correct size showing AO2 and TgME49_306338 expression were only observed in linoleic acid&#8211;supplemented monolayers.

<title>Inhibition of delta-6-desaturase causes sexual development in cell culture mouse cells</title>
<p>The dependence of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual development on high levels of linoleic acid was intriguing because cats are the only mammal known to lack delta-6-desaturase activity in their small intestines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref014">14</xref>]. Delta-6-desaturase is the first and rate-limiting step for the conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid. Linoleic acid is the dominant fatty acid in cat serum, comprising 25%&#8211;46% of the total fatty acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref015">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref018">18</xref>], whereas rodents serum contains only 3%&#8211;10% linoleic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref019">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref022">22</xref>].

To test this hypothesis, we infected mouse intestinal monolayers with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> and supplemented them with linoleic acid and the chemical SC-26196, a specific inhibitor of the delta-6-desaturase enzyme, to establish high steady-state levels of linoleic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref023">23</xref>]. Five days after infection of the mouse culture with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>, we assessed merozoite markers BRP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref007">7</xref>] and GRA11B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref006">6</xref>].

<title>Inhibition of delta-6-desaturase causes sexual development in live mice</title>
<p>Oocysts excreted in cat feces must undergo a sporulation process to become infectious to the next host. We attempted to sporulate the round structures containing oocyst wall antigen that were derived from either cat or inhibited mouse cultured intestinal cells at room temperature with aerosolization for 7&#8211;14 days.

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>All together, these results define the mechanism of species specificity for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual development and show that the species barrier can be broken for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual development by inhibiting delta-6-desaturase activity in the intestines of a nonfeline host. The lack of delta-6-desaturase activity and the buildup of linoleic acid likely enhance <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual development in multiple ways. First, prior work suggests linoleic acid is cytotoxic for the asexual tachyzoite stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref031">31</xref>]; thus, tachyzoite development would be halted in a linoleic-rich environment. Second, inhibition of delta-6-desaturase likely lowers arachidonic acid levels, which would alter the production of immune lipid mediators known as eicosanoids. Finally, the dramatic difference between oleic acid with one double bond and linoleic acid with two highlights that linoleic acid is probably used as a signaling molecule and not to meet basic nutritional needs. Quorum-sensing for sexual reproduction in fungi is dependent on oxygenation of linoleic acid but not oleic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref009">9</xref>]. The multiple host and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases might oxygenate linoleic acid to an oxylipin signaling molecule for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> sexual development to proceed. Other protozoan parasites also rely on host derived lipids, which may be used as signaling molecules as well as lipid sources for parasite growth during their life cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000364.ref033">33</xref>].</p>

<p>Fecal samples from the mice with and without delta-6-desaturase inhibitor treatment were collected. Genomic DNA was generated from 0.1 g of feces from each mouse using the power soil DNA kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions except that cells were broken by a bead beater instead of a vortex. A standard curve was generated using a dilution series of 10<sup>1</sup>&#8211;10<sup>5</sup> parasites per well amplified using the SAG1 primer set described above, based on a genomic DNA sample with known parasite quantity. The Ct values were plotted against the log of the parasite numbers. The number of target gene copies in each sample can be interpolated from the linear regression of the standard curve.

<p>Senior Editor</p>
<p>PLOS Biology</p>
<p>==================</p>
<p>INFORMATION REGARDING THE REPORTING CHECKLIST:</p>
<p>PLOS Biology is pleased to support the "minimum reporting standards in the life sciences" initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/9sm4x/" ns0:type="simple">https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/9sm4x/</ext-link>). This effort brings together a number of leading journals and reproducibility experts to develop minimum expectations for reporting information about Materials (including data and code), Design, Analysis and Reporting (MDAR) in published papers. We believe broad alignment on these standards will be to the benefit of authors, reviewers, journals and the wider research community and will help drive better practise in publishing reproducible research. </p>
<p>We are therefore participating in a community pilot involving a small number of life science journals to test the MDAR checklist. The checklist is intended to help authors, reviewers and editors adopt and implement the minimum reporting framework.  </p>
<p>IMPORTANT: We have chosen your manuscript to participate in this trial. The relevant documents can be located here:</p>
<p>MDAR reporting checklist (to be filled in by you): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://plos.io/MDARChecklist" ns0:type="simple">https://plos.io/MDARChecklist</ext-link></p>
<p>**We strongly encourage you to complete the MDAR reporting checklist and return it to us with your full submission, as described above.  We would also be very grateful if you could complete this author survey:</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://forms.gle/seEgCrDtM6GLKFGQA" ns0:type="simple">https://forms.gle/seEgCrDtM6GLKFGQA</ext-link> </p>

<p>Interpreting the MDAR Framework: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://plos.io/MDARFramework" ns0:type="simple">https://plos.io/MDARFramework</ext-link> </p>
<p>Please note that your completed checklist and survey will be shared with the minimum reporting standards working group.  However, the working group will not be provided with access to the manuscript or any other confidential information including author identities, manuscript titles or abstracts.  Feedback from this process will be used to consider next steps, which might include revisions to the content of the checklist.  Data and materials from this initial trial will be publicly shared in September 2019.  Data will only be provided in aggregate form and will not be parsed by individual article or by journal, so as to respect the confidentiality of responses.  </p>
<p>Please treat the checklist and elaboration as confidential as public release is planned for September 2019.</p>
<p>We would be grateful for any feedback you may have.</p>

</p>
<p>Dear Dr Knoll,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Intestinal delta-6-desaturase activity determines host range for Toxoplasma sexual reproduction" for consideration as a Research Article by PLOS Biology. Your paper was evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors as well as by an Academic Editor with relevant expertise and by three independent reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important topic. Based on the reviews, we will probably accept this manuscript for publication, providing that you will modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations.</p>
<p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within two weeks. Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer. In addition to the remaining revisions and before we will be able to formally accept your manuscript and consider it "in press", we also need to ensure that your article conforms to our guidelines, one of which is described below under DATA POLICY. A member of our team will be in touch shortly with a set of requests. As we can't proceed until these requirements are met, your swift response will help prevent delays to publication.</p>
<p>Upon acceptance of your article, your final files will be copyedited and typeset into the final PDF. While you will have an opportunity to review these files as proofs, PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling or significant scientific errors. Therefore, please take this final revision time to assess and make any remaining major changes to your manuscript.</p>
<p>Please note that you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
<p>Please note that an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you opted out when submitting your manuscript. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online, uncheck the box. Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us as soon as possible if you or your institution is planning to press release the article.</p>
<p>To submit your revision, please go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/" ns0:type="simple">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/</ext-link> and log in as an Author. Click the link labelled 'Submissions Needing Revision' to find your submission record. Your revised submission must include a cover letter, a Response to Reviewers file that provides a detailed response to the reviewers' comments (if applicable), and a track-changes file indicating any changes that you have made to the manuscript. </p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Di Jiang, PhD</p>
<p>Associate Editor</p>

<p>Reviewer remarks:</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: Summary</p>
<p>The work described in this manuscript is truly transformative as it not only identifies the trigger of the Toxoplasma sexual cycle and why this only occurs in cats, it continues to fulfil Koch&#8217;s postulates by overcoming this species barrier by demonstrating the completion of the cycle in mice (and largely in vitro as well) by mimicking the cat environment. The work is also transformative in its approach as this is the first application of cat intestinal organoids to Toxoplasma. Besides the major biological breakthrough, these insights are relevant toward developing sexual recombination experiments in Toxoplasma (a tool that has been cumbersome due to its poor efficiency and the need of cats) as well as toward developing control strategies of cats shedding oocysts, which is a responsible for a large portion of human infections with Toxoplasma. In addition, the work is timely in light of the recent sudden and politically motivated suspension of the use of cats at the USDA, which supplied the majority of the Toxoplasma field with Toxoplasma oocysts. This work is therefore relevant for a very wide audience of microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, clinicians, epidemiologists and basic parasitology researchers. By fulfilling Koch&#8217;s postulates the paper per definition is very rigorous. In summary, a through breakthrough manuscript well described and executed. Only one minor comment as described below.</p>
<p>Specific comments.</p>
<p>Supplementary information; No Fig S2, but a fig 6. This is likely a mix up. Legend says &#8220;strained&#8221; instead of &#8220;stained&#8221; for DBA staining.</p>
<p>P7 line 13: in the sentence is referred to sero conversion, however, no data supporting this statement are shown in neither Fig 6e nor S2.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2 (Felix Yarovinsky, signed review): In this groundbreaking work the authors succeeded in answering a major biological question in the field of parasite biology.  It was a mystery why the sexual cycle of Toxoplasma gondii is limited to felines, while the asexual life cycle can happen in any warm-blooded mammal. Using an elegant in vitro system based on the intestinal organoids, the authors identified that linoleic acid is essential for the expression of markers associated with the sexual cycle of the parasite.  The authors provide the detailed biochemical explanation for this requirement.  It appears that cats are deficient in delta-6-desaturase, the rate&#8208;limiting step for the conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid. As a result, linoleic acid is the dominant fatty acid in cat serum. This explains why the felines have an increased level of linoleic acid.  </p>
<p>The authors next validated in vitro observation with mice that were fed with linoleic acid and delta-6-desaturase inhibitor.  This treatment results in the full sexual cycle of the parasite in the murine intestine.  This is a truly remarkable discovery in biology, and while there might be minor technical gaps in the work, I believe an immediate publication would benefit the scientific community. This is a highly significant work that not only teach us new biology, but also has a major clinical significance since it provides a novel biochemical tool to deal with toxoplasmosis in cats that may eventually lead to the elimination of this parasite in cats.  </p>
<p>I only have two minor comments </p>
<p>1. In the following statement &#8216;After 5 days of infection, we found that the addition of linoleic acid but not oleic acid caused approximately 35% of the T. gondii to express both merozoite stage markers (Fig. 2a)&#8217; the authors forgot to acknowledge the data shown in Fig 1d-1g as an additional experimental support in the above-mentioned statement. </p>
<p>Figure 2, Y- axis:  the labeling needs to be more specific, as &#8216;%GRA11B and BRP1 positive&#8217; is confusing.</p>
<p>Reviewer #3: Although it has been known for decades that felids are the definitive host for sexual replication of the intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, the molecular underpinnings of this remarkable host specificity for parasite mating has remained an important unresolved mystery. The current work compellingly establishes that an excess linoleic acid drives sexual differentiation in culture and in mice, thus establishing for the first time in vitro and alternative in vivo models for T. gondii sexual development. The work represents a key breakthrough that will permit further dissection of sexual development, accelerate classical genetic linkage mapping of important traits, and reduce the dependence on using cats as an experimental model, among other avenues. The authors provide thorough qualitative and quantitative data that is appropriately interpreted and supportive of the conclusions. The following minor considerations should be addressed.</p>
<p>Line 21. Delete on of the &#8220;withs&#8221;</p>
<p>Page 8, line 5-7. This statement should be softened from &#8220;likely&#8221; given that no data is presented to support it. It is suggested that the authors rephrase it to e.g., It is possible that the multiple&#8230;</p>
